Objective 1 \nUse the Forest Rights Act to claim legal rights for individuals and communities and strengthen grassroots \ndemocratic institutions in 200 villages across 4 districts of northern West Bengal. \n \n \n7.1.b. Objective 1: Principal accomplishments \nVery good ground mobilis ation despite the pandemic. The following meetings at various levels were \norganised. \n20 community level meetings were organised with 40 participants on an average. Any adult in the village \ncan attend this type of open meeting. In some places women participation is less as they go to work in others \nhomes for domestic help or they go to forest for foraging. Increasing livelihood options in the village will \nhelp women\u2019s increase participation. The purpose of these meetings was to provide basic orientation on the \nFRA and talk about the provisions under FRA to start new Gram Sabhas. \n1 district level meeting was organised where Gram Sabha members from 30 villages spread across 3 districts \nhad participated. Basically, the district meeting was organised to raise awa reness around FRA so that \nrepresentatives would go back to their respective villages and work with other villagers in order to \nstrengthen their Gram Sabhas. Sometimes people don't realise that they got less land while getting the Patta. \nThose who have rece ived less land under IFR are going back to the district officials. Those villages that \nhave not been converted to revenue villages have started the process as a result of this meeting. \n3 alliance building meetings with like -minded organisations were organi sed in Nagpur, Kolkata and in \nPurulia. Different groups related to forest issues from different districts have participated in the meetings \nso that the FRA is implemented better across the state. \nVillage level leadership committees were formed in 7 villages to drive the community processes through \nGram Sabhas. \nCapacity building workshop on GPS & satellite mapping is going on for CFR mapping in the operational \nforest villages with the Gram Sabha representatives so that they can authenticate their cust omary forest \nboundary and claim CFR with the map. \nBesides, the regular meetings, interactions with the forest and district administration are being continued \nbecause the implementation of FRA has to be recognized by the government. FRA guidelines are not being \nfollowed. The process is not done correctly by the government hence people have to repeatedly go for the \ncorrection of land records, ensure their representation in the Sub Divisional Level Committee (SDLC) and \nbringing issues back in the village. \n  \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1: Shortfalls \nThe starting of developing the audio-visual materials have been delayed due to Covid pandemic. \n \n \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 \nTo create livelihood opportunities for the communities living in and around the forest  to  build their \nresilience and encourage conservation of forests and the surrounding landscape. \n \n \n7.2.b. Objective 2: Principal accomplishments \nThe outcomes of the livelihood activities have surpassed our own expectations. People were mobilised in \n25 villages to form clusters for community level farming. Around 680 families involved in farming have \nreaped a harvest in jute, mustard and vegetables.  \n\u2022 300 families were involved in Jute farming and each family had made an average additional \nincome of Rs.27,000 \n\u2022 350 families were involved in mustard farming and each family had made an additional income \nof around Rs.10,000 to Rs.12,000. The marketing of mustard oil is in the process. People in these \nclusters have brought 330 acres of land under mustard cultivation. \n\u2022 35 families in Nimati village were involved in vegetable farming and each made an additional \nincome of Rs.600 \nAll of these are additional income for the families because earlier they used to grow rice and then the land \nremained unused for the rest of the year. Rice is mainly grown for sustenance. Most of the villagers in the \noperational area are daily wage earners. On an average they earn around Rs.300 per day as labourers. \nUsually they get 4 months of work in a year which earns around Rs.36,000 annually per family. The clusters \ninvolved in farming have been able to make some additional income on top of their annual income from \nlabour work  because of this livelihood initiative.   \nThere have been some farmers who grow jute for which they  take a loan of Rs.400 for a bigha (0.33 acre) \nfrom the money lender. And farmers who were involved in commercial mustard farming used to take a loan \nof Rs.5000 to 600 per  bigha (0.33 acre)  for the initial input costs. This year the situation has changed or \ngot better in a way because the cluster got the seed and other input support for farming and also had a good \nincome from the harvest.  \nApart from the farming initiatives, 2 nurseries have been raised in different villages with a total of 80,000 \nsaplings of local indigenous varieties from the forest. The plantation will happen in monsoon season on all \nthe degraded lands along the customary boundaries of the forest villages.  \nFormal meetings with all the Gram Sabhas in 25 villages happened and resolutions were passed in order to \ninitiate the farming and plantation work in the forest villages. Several follow up meetings with the Gram \nSabha and the clusters had been carried out to start the newly adopted livelihood initiative. Besides, some \nworkshops on the technical aspect of organic farming were also organised in 25 villages with the farmers \ninvolved in clusters. \n  \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2: Shortfalls \nWe are a bit late in terms of plantation effort because the seed collection was delayed  due to the Covid \ninduced lockdown. Plantation is a time sensitive work. We missed the first plantation time because of the \ndelayed seed collection and we had to wait for the next plantation time. On top of that the first batch of \nsaplings got destroyed by the elephants for which we had to change the location of one of the nurseries.  \n \n \n \n \n7.3.a. Objective 3 \nTo develop a new rung of leadership from the youth (12 to 18 years) through an education that is rooted in \ntheir socio-cultural-ecological context and empowers them to develop self-reliance and live in their \nculture with dignity. \n \n \n7.3.b. Objective 3: Principal accomplishments \nWe could not organise any formal workshops in the initial months of the project due to Covid pandemic. \nHowever,  several rounds of discussion have been done with the adolescents and youth (aged between 12 \nto 18 years old) both including men and women in different villages. Based on those interactions we are \nnow developing the learning modules which will be completed by April, 2022.  Due to the enthusiasm \nfrom the community we increased the learning centre from six to seven. Selection of teachers through an \ninterview process from the community has been done. We are in the process of buying one desktop for \neach centre. We observed the FRA day on December 18th in which people from different villages \nparticipated, and community members of different tribes presented their unique cultural performances. \n \n \n7.3.c. Objective 3: Shortfalls \nWe could not organise any formal workshops on planned time for developing the learning modules due to \nthe Covid pandemic. However, our experts (resource persons) have visited all the targeted villages several \ntimes in order to interact with the women and youth groups in the process of dev eloping basic learning \nmodules.  \nNo school level competitions could be done because schools were closed due to the Covid-19 induced \nrestrictions. \n  \n \n \n \n8.", "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project?": "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project? \n1. In the process of nursery development, we have learned that forest villagers want indigenous \nvarieties that grow naturally in the forest for their nurseries unlike timber that is always promoted \nfor plantation. The forest villagers believe that plantations of more indigenous variety can restore \nthe degraded forest patches and eventually reduce the human-animal conflict.  \n2. We have found that the youth group in the villages are very enthusiastic about computer \neducation.  \n3. We also learned that cluster farming can have a huge impact on the income of the families. \n \n \n \n \n9.", "How will your team use this information to change the way you work?": "How will your team use this information to change the way you work? \n1. We are raising only indigenous varieties in our nurseries. There is no plan for timber plantation. \n2. We have incorporated computer learning in all 7 centers. All centers will start with one desktop \neach this year. \n3. The huge production of mustard and jute has made us think of exploring the scope of value \naddition and marketing initiatives.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nThe Oak Project: As part of our ongoing efforts to create a social registry for migrant workers, our \nJan Saathis registered 1,30,859 migrant workers across sources and destinations on the Jan Saathi \nmobile application during the project period, out of which 70906 women have been registered on the \nportal. These workers were also provided with pre-departure and post-arrival training sessions. In \nthese sessions, the workers are informed about their rights and the mechanisms in place to safeguard \nthem. The workers are also informed about the various entitlements that they can access at the \ndestination and source they are currently present. \n \n \nSocial status of families registered in West Bengal \n  \nThe team has been successful in facilitating 78,153 scheme applications for various households. Out \nof these, till May 2022, 70,201 applications have converted to benefits of which 36,154 are for \nwomen-led households. The application-to-benefit conversion ratio is (~89%) which is similar to \nwhat was envisaged at the start of the program.  \nOverall MRC Progress: In the MRC program, running across 13 states, we have currently reached \nout to 28,22,497 households since October 2020, they have been registered with the Migrants \nResilience Collaborative. Aligned with our strategy to register women as primary respondents for the \nhouseholds, 40% of households have a woman as the primary respondent in May 2022. \nOur Jan Saathis uses the mobile application to check eligible schemes for registered migrant workers \nand facilitate applications for such schemes. The Jan Saathis also tracks the delivery of benefits for \neach application they help submit. The major schemes that we focused on in West Bengal were \nLakshmi Bhandar, Krishak Bandhu, old age pension, widow pension, disability pension, Bina Mulya \nSamajik Suraksha Yojana, BOCW, PMSBY, E-shram, BMSSY and Swasthya Sathi.  Our team was \nable to facilitate and implement all the above-mentioned activities smoothly through the constant \nsupport of the district labor officials.  \n\n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \nTill May 22, 26.6 lakh scheme applications were facilitated and 22.20 lakh benefits were received in \nthe MRC program, working across 13 states The focus in many states was in ensuring the filing of \napplications for the community instead of only registering them. In May 2022, the major schemes \nunder which applications were filed include EShram, PMSY , Ayushman Bharat, BoCW cards, PM \nKisan Saman Nidhi, PM Awas Yojana, MGNREGA and work related to ration. \n  \n \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n1. Due to the second wave of Covid19, our operations were halted from April 21- June 21. \n2. Political interference at the local level affects operation. Despite securing support from \nGram Pradhan, the team often faces resistance from other members of the same political \nparty. \n3. The MRC during the initial days did not receive support from the community. They \nbelieved that we had come from NRC and harassed our team members.   \n4. Government does not accept offline application forms. The only medium to submit the \napplications is through Duare Sarkar camps. Currently, there are no mechanisms for \nsubmitting the applications for state-specific schemes online, so the team has to wait for \nduare Sarkar camps to happen in order to submit the application form. This makes availing \nthe entitlement lengthy. \n \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective \nEnabling responsible recruitment \n \n \n \n7.2.b.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nThe Oak Project: In West Bengal, the team has been getting access to new construction sites under \nMission BOCW. Mission BOCW has been largely successful and we have further streamlined \nimplementation support on sites to ensure workers can access social security support, keeping the \neffect of on-site operations to a minimum. The team in Kolkata engages in 2 sites that come under \nand till now, 1087 applications have been submitted for 355 unique workers and 751 benefits were \ndelivered for 348 unique workers at construction sites. \nOverall MRC Progress: In the last year, the team has focused on Mission BOCW which is a \ncoordinated effort with the government, private sector, and civil society to help migrant construction \nworkers and their family\u2019s tide over the crisis. Through this campaign, we aim to register one million \nconstruction workers by December'22 in 100 cities and districts of 12 states of India. \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \nThe targeted outcome this year was to get labor responsibly recruited to Industries but as we \nproceeded, we understood that to responsibly recruit labor we need to first initiate partnerships with \nthe industry to gain access to sites. Hence, we started to focus on Mission BOCW as a stepping stone \ntowards the larger goal of responsible recruitment which will be an eventual outcome of the same.  \nWe are currently engaging with 11 industry partners (employers) across the textile and construction \nsectors. These include names Such as BCI, CREDAI, BCI, HDFC, Godrej and Tata Realty. In \nPartnership with HDFC capital, we are in the process of launching an initiative aimed at recognizing \nand rewarding the industry\u2019s best practices, which in turn will ensure proactive engagement of real \nestate companies in providing social security for the construction worker\u2019s compliance at the sites \nunder HDFC capital. An LOI has been signed with the CREDAI National (The prime industry body \nof construction developers), through which they will help with onboarding developers onto the \nMission BOCW-where social security entitlements will be facilitated on-site at all MRC destination \ncities. \n  \n \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n1. Gaining access to sites has been a major challenge.  \n2. Even after receiving permission for the sites, the onsite managers create hindrance in \nregistering the workers for BOCW. \n3. Lack of proper documents (Aadhaar card, bank details etc.)  with the workers at \nconstruction sites limits our ability to facilitate social security entitlements. \n4. Besides, the presence of promoters of real estate companies/ site managers often hinders \ninteraction of Jan Saathis with the workers and the ability of the workers to share their \nproblems freely. \n5. The onsite managers expect that the scheme's benefits should be given immediately to the \nlaborers, which is not possible as the delivery is determined by the processes at the Labor \nand other relevant departments. \n6. BOCW and many major schemes are not applicable for inter-state migrant workers in West \nBengal. A number of workers in Kolkata, especially in the construction sector, are inter-\nstate migrants which could not be benefited due to the limitations.  \n \n \n \n7.3.a.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nThe Oak Project: In the last year, 797 calls were received on the helpline and across all districts, a \ntotal of 97 cases were registered in the supported districts and 41 cases have been resolved till now. \nThe team has received 4 cases of accidents at the workplace, 1 case of minimum wages, 1 case of \nforced labour, 91 cases of non-payment of wages. The team has currently recovered the wage of \naround Rs 2,34,492. The remaining cases lack evidence and that\u2019s why they are not closed yet. The \nteam is continuously working on promoting helpline services in the communities and labor nakas \n(labor hubs).  \nWe have held awareness sessions for 39,822 workers in the workplace about their rights and \nentitlements through pre-departure and post-arrival training. Our target was 80,000 but due to gaining \nlate access to sites as covid 2nd wave was then prevalent, we will cover the balance 40,000 workers \nin year 2 and 3.  \nOverall MRC Progress: In the MRC program, running across 13 states, 34,665 calls have been \nreceived on the helpline since October 2020, in which 6035 cases have been registered. 1127 cases \nwere received from the field team and 4,908 were received through Helpline till May 22. Out of the \ntotal cases received till October,3,256 cases have been closed after adequate interventions. Different \nstrategies have been adopted to popularize the helpline. Besides IEC materials, wall paintings have \nbeen used an innovative strategy so that the workers get to know about the helpline. The helpline \nhas received calls from over 425 districts across the country. \nWe have hired lawyers who are helping our team and stakeholders in implementing and imbibe SOPs, \nenabling and capacitating the system towards transformation- Exposure to labour departments, \ncommunity volunteer building relationships and sensitization of field and central teams.

Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n1. Collecting evidence from the labor  for the cases to proceed with them legally has been a \nchallenge, as the labor is not fully aware of how to collect proper evidence and this causes \nobstacles in solving the cases.  \n2. Even though the workers are fully aware and all the evidence is in place , the workers do not \nwant to fight against the contractor as they are scared that they might not find work in the \nfuture.  \n \n \n8.", "Significant changes": "Significant changes.

Objective 1 \nTo empower communities through access to information and entitlements with the help of the \nSEWA Shakti Kendras [SEWA empowerment centres] in Jharkhand and West Bengal \n \n \n7.1.b. Objective 1: Principal accomplishments \nThe experience of SEWA and similar organizations demonstrate that workers in the informal economy, \nespecially women, benefit from organising themselves to identify their status as workers and demand \nbetter working conditions and fair wages. Organizing enables an otherwise scattered labour force to \nnegotiate with employers and decision-makers from the government. It is to this end that SEWA works \nwith women in the informal economy to improve women and girls\u2019 agency and visibility, autonomy and \nsecure their socio-economic rights. The programme across two states of Jharkhand and West Bengal \nworks to address the systematic issues affecting women and girls and to advance the rights of these \nwomen as informal women workers under the gamut of the unorganised sector. \nThroughout the past fifteen months, the perils of COVID-19 continued to present multiple challenges to \nour members, through the second lockdown imposed in the months of April-May 2021, followed by the \nthird wave of COVID inflicted field restrictions in January-February 2022. For West Bengal, this situation \nwas also politically charged in the state with the Legislative Assembly election throughout March and \nApril 2021, which led to a fairly slow start to programme activities as per the Workplan. In Bengal, the \nsituation was aggravated by another challenge: the floods in Malda. Almost 15000 community members \nin Malda faced flooding during the rainy season. Meanwhile, in Jharkhand, the situation was aggravated \ndue to a lack of proper channels of communication, which got lost due to the sufficient infrastructure \navailable for our members. \nThroughout the year, the grassroots leaders and organisers in both states have worked dedicatedly towards \nincreasing engagements resulting in outreach: \nTrade West Bengal Jharkhand \nBeedi workers 21000   \nDomestic workers 4000 1600 \nAgriculture   3907 \nConstruction   1400 \nOthers   587 \nTaking the membership base across both states to 32494, increasing the membership by 20% in year 1 of \nthe current grant.  \nThrough the experience of engaging with informal women workers, grassroots leadership has emerged at \nthe CORE for any programme development or strengthening of the SEWA movement for SEWA Bharat. \n \n \nAagewans (SEWA grassroots women leaders) are the elected leaders in the SEWA movement. They are \nthe face of SEWA. The Program aims to increase the bargaining power of these grassroots leaders by \ndeveloping their capacities to provide leadership in their communities and understand issues surrounding \nthe women in the informal economy be it in trade, occupation, rights and access. Due to their local \npresence, Agewans are often approached by SEWA members and the larger community to help them \nregister for government schemes or benefits, as well as to negotiate wages and issues with employers. \nAagewans play a vital role in the SEWA movement as they are the bridge between the Government, \ncontractors of work and all the women working in the informal economy to ensure the last-mile delivery \nof services and support to them. Therefore,  facilitating their capacity building and knowledge \nenhancement around SEWA \u2019s work is our foremost priority.  \nThe team in West Bengal focused the interventions on activating aagevans towards an action-oriented \napproach and emphasised the need to reach out to more women workers. Whilst in Jharkhand, which is \nrelatively a newer intervention area, the focus is to further strengthen the collectivisation process led by \nthe aagevans so that they can lead the trade-specific advocacy and government liaisoning. \n  \nCapacity Building of Agewans through Agewan Vikas Training \nThroughout the year from March 2021 onwards, the Agewan received various training and knowledge \nbuilding sessions. In Jharkhand, two batches covering  40 Agewan completed their Agewan Vikas \nProgram training course which focused on the following modules (1) SEWA Ideology (2) Importance of \nUnion & Trade organising (3) Identifying issues and taking community issues (4) Trade committee.  \nAcross West Bengal, the training(s) was conducted to equip 106 agewans with the knowledge and skills \nrequired to become efficient leaders at the community level.  \nFor the Bengal team, post the training the agewans from every block prepared a three-month plan in which \nthey included linkages with government schemes like Swasthya Sathi, Ration Adhaar link, preparing a rate \nchart for domestic workers etc. This made the process of evaluating the growth of aagevans across the year \nmore thorough.  \nVarious inputs given to the aagevans throughout the year, in the form of training(s), sessions or \ndiscussions have led to not only increased awareness of aagevans among the community members but \nresulted in several actions being taken by aagevans that manifested their leadership qualities.  \nTopics Participation - West \nBengal \nTopics Participation - Jharkhand \nAwareness on Skill \ndevelopment and \nAlternative livelihood \n108; KVIC Agewan Vikas Program \nModule training  \n40 Aagewan  \nHealth Awareness session 16; SEWA resource \nperson \nHealth Master Trainer in \nHazaribagh  \n20 Master trainers (The \nAgewans) \nAagewan Vikash 106; SEWA resource \nperson \nTrade Committee \nUnderstanding and E-\nShram Portal registration \nprocess session  \n25 Agewan & 12 SEWA \nJharkhand Staff \nWage code & Social \nSecurity code \n60; Joint labour \ncommissioner \nV .V Giri Trainings  12 SEWA Jharkhand staff  \nPanchayat system 45; SEWA resource \nperson \nEconomic & Social \nSecurity (ITUC-TURIN) \n1 SEWA Jharkhand staff \nNational Rural Livelihood \nGuarantee Act \n45; SEWA resource \nperson \n    \n \n \nPWDV A, 2005 40 Domestic workers; \nprotection officer, \nMurshidabad \n60 Beedi workers: District \nJudge, DLSA \n    \nToday, they have a higher degree of confidence as a result of their training, and their participation has \nincreased in community and trade activities. They are also gradually leading the SEWA meetings held in \ntheir localities, moderating the sessions to the best of their ability. They also assist in the development of \nthe strategy for monthly community and trade events in their respective locations. The agewans are \nfacilitating social security linkages in collaboration with the SEWA Shakti Kendra linkages such as E-\nShram portal registration, conducting Mahila Arogya Meetings and linking communities with public \nhealth services. \nIn West Bengal,  through the above -mentioned training in Berhampore, 4 agewans have taken up the \nresponsibility to conduct unit meetin gs (a unit is a cluster of 20 -30 local women coming together for a \ncommon purpose)  and mobilize the domestic workers who are coming from the outskirts of the city to fix \ntheir rates. Shampa ben and Deepali ben, two agewans (domestic workers) got a chance to take part in the \nSEWA National level domestic workers workshop in November 2021 where they highlighted their issues on \nthe National platform. This knowledge helps them to mobilize others and talk about their demands with \ntheir employers. The domestic wo rkers in Bengal were able to visit the labour department to enrol \nthemselves under Samajik Suraksha Yojana (a social security scheme of the W Bengal government). This \nwas important as otherwise they would not have any Social Security as the state does not recognise the \nDomestic Workers as \u2018workers\u2019 as yet. The Labour Commissioner agreed and committed to helping them \nwith the enrollment. \nIn Jharkhand, the Agewans are representing their trade memorandum to MPs and participating in the process \nof memorandum su bmission. In the years 2021 and 2022, they submitted the advocacy points regarding \nILO Convention 189 (Provisioned work rights of domestic workers: Decent wage, favourable workplace, \nfixed work hours, 4 weekly holidays in a month, no discrimination at the workplace, wage on time)   for \ndeveloping more inclusive policies for domestic workers in the country under the guidance of the National \nDomestic Workers platform. This has garnered the recognition of agewans among key community leaders \nsuch as the Municipa l Councillor. Through the social security sessions, the Agewans now understand the \nimportance of registration of members under the Labour Board according to their trade and have been \ncontinuously engaging with them to ensure all their area members are gett ing registered under the BoCW \nBoard, Unorganised Workers Board and the E-Shram Portal. \nDigital Recognition: Many Agewan represented themselves on many digital platforms in the year 2021 by \nvideo documentation and online session participation, discussing th eir work and their journey as Agewan \nin their neighbourhood as well as at their workplace, and highlighting the conversation on worker rights. \n  \nAagevan led meetings at the community level, \nSEWA Bharat, in West Bengal, has been organising women through uni t meetings and giving them a \nplatform where they can come together and discuss their community -specific issues and address them \njointly. A total of 473 meetings were conducted by 24 agewans across Murshidabad and Malda reaching up \nto more than 10000 members. \nThe various topics on which meetings were conducted included Government schemes like SSY , Lakhir \nBhandar, Duare Sarkar, E-shram card and community level issues including sanitation, safety etc. \nThrough these meetings, it is ensured that women from the community have access to information on \nschemes and services which otherwise they would not be aware of and therefore would not be able to \navail of the benefits covered under the schemes. Being members of the marginalised group, women are \noften exploited in the name of scheme linkages and become victims of fraud. Through these meetings, \nthey are well informed about the schemes which prevent them from falling into any trap. Through the \nmeetings community members have collectively taken up action to protest against low wages and held \n \n \nmeetings with Mahajans to put forward their demands, To ensure good health and hygiene within the \ncommunity signature campaign was held at Suti (block in Raghunathganj) and a letter was submitted to \npanchayat in demand of improving drainage to which the panchayat responded and acted upon. These \nmeetings also enable women to come out of their confined zones and share their concerns in the meeting. \nThis gives them more courage and confidence to interact and express their views. \nIn Jharkhand, the agewans have started conducting meetings in the community on what they learn from \nSEWA and that which need to be reached out to the members. as they are leading meetings in the new \nareas and this is helping SEWA to expand its work and membership in Jharkhand.  A total of 25 such \nwomen are regularly undertaking the responsibilities of an Aagevan forward. \n  \nAwareness programmes conducted by Agewans: \nVarious awareness sessions and meetings were held on topics like government health structure, balan ced \ndiet, vaccination, awareness regarding COVID -19 safety protocols, and the importance of sanitation and \nhygiene in everyday life across Malda and Murshidabad. A total of  10 awareness programmes were \nconducted by agewans in their community, reaching up to more than 500 members across Malda and \nMurshidabad. The programmes were used as a platform to address the myths and misconceptions related to \nhealth practices, and vaccination at the ground level which makes them vulnerable to the diseases but due \nto the intervention of the agewans through the meetings and awareness sessions, our members have become \nsensitised and are taking steps to break the myths and misconceptions. Our agewans have successfully \nreferred 6000 members for the first dose of vaccination and 4000 for the second dose of vaccination. \nIn addition to the ongoing concern about health, many sessions and programmes were also centred around \nthe loss of work and the importance of restoring livelihoods. 10 agewans and 3 youth group members \nmobilized village members in Pathanpara, Lalgola (Block in Murshidabad) and collectively demanded an \nincrease in wages for beedi rolling at the Block level office. The agewans were joined by the other \ncommunity members and other trade unions such as CITU (Centre of Indian Trade Unions). In response to \ntheir demand wages increased from Rs 155 to Rs 165, for every 1000 bidis. This was also supported by a \nlarger intervention to protect the livelihood of the marginalised, SEWA Bharat facilitated linkage with \nMGNREGA; a total of 150 members received work through this. \nIn Jharkhand, the result of a public meeting conducted by the domestic workers in Ranchi, wherein they \ndemanded work in Urban and to start Urban MGNREGA in the city as well, was conducted under the \nNational Domestic Workers platform. Members started getting themselves registered under Urban \nMGNREGA, by the year-end of 2022, Agewan  (Sunita Orain) from Pandra Ranchi reported that along with \nher more than 10 members have received 90 days of Job under Ranchi Municipal Corporation for sweeping \nwork in Vendor Market.  \nMy Fair Home Campaign by Domestic workers  \nBerhampore, Murshidabad \nIncreasing fear of transmission among common people and lockdown rules led to the loss of livelihood \namong domestic workers as most of the employers were not ready to allow domestic workers at their homes \nand as a result, they were deprived of wages, continued to be a persistent problem even during the second-\nwave of COVID -19 pandemic. SEWA Bengal initiated the \u201c My Fair Home Campaign\u201d in Berhampore, \nMurshidabad to promote fair wages and get domestic workers back to work through negotiation with the \nemployers. Through the campaign, 5 domestic workers who lost their jobs due to the pandemic got back \ntheir jobs. \nRina Mondal is one of the Domestic workers who took part in the campaign, After the lockdown was \nimposed due to the emerging second wave of the pandemic she was asked by her employer to not come to \nwork nor was she being paid a minimum wage to support her family duri ng the distressing time. Through \nthe campaign 3 agewans and 2 domestic workers and organisers from SEWA West Bengal collectively \napproached the employers to support her with her monthly wages at the household level. This led to an \nachievement where the emp loyers agreed to support them till the lockdown restrictions were lifted post \nwhich she joined back to work unconditionally. \n \n \nRanchi, Jharkhand \nDomestic workers have been facilitated in understanding their wages according to their work hours and \ndays. Therefore, a regular meeting with Agewan and the trade committee members has been undertaken to \nunderstand how the rate chart should be normally developed by the domestic workers. Therefore a campaign \nwas conducted by the Agewan and Domestic Worker trade group members and trade leaders by conducting \nfocus group discussions in areas from where the domestic workers go to work to different areas. firstly to \nunderstand that in current days how domestic workers are getting their work according to their work hours. \nThrough the focus group discussion, SEWA learnt about their household counts, work hours in each \nhousehold, the amount they receive, number of rooms they take care of, types of service they provide to the \nhousehold, and distance of workplace area. Now in the next phase, the domestic workers will be facilitated \nand mobilised to bring the rates to a common rate so that each can do equal work and get an equal rate.  \n  \nCampaign on MGNREGA:  \nThe \u2018Right to Food\u2019 network observed a 14-day campaign from 15th September to 1st October 2021. As a \npart of the initiative, agewans of SEWA West Bengal took part in the campaign. In Murshidabad and Malda \ndistricts SEWA members conducted poster campaigns and submitted letters to the nodal officer mentioning \ntheir demands of get ting work under the MGNREGA scheme thereby letting the voices reach the duty \nbearers and making them accountable.  Around 250 members received work through this campaign \nwhich ensured their Right to livelihood. \n\u2014---X\u2014--- \nEngagement with Y outh  \nThe inclusion of youth in transforming their communities by organizing them into groups is fundamental \nfor the growth and development of the community as a whole. Years of Engagement with the youth have \nhelped in developing the next generation of leadership at the grassroots who are capable of addressing their \ncommunity-level issues and advocating for the fulfilment of rights of women involved in the informal \neconomy thereby leading the SEWA movement forward. The training(s) and meetings have provided them \nwith a platform to learn new skills, build upon their knowledge and be aware of their rights and entitlements \nIn Jharkhand, as a part of learning from Bengal, local youth groups have been created to recognise their \nissues, address them and develop the second SEWA generation. Thus from 2021 SEWA Jharkhand started \norganising the adolescent girls as well, started conducting informal meetings with them in their area to \nknow them more and to also know what they know about informal work, SEWA as a movement of women \nworkers and the challenges their mothers face to earn a decent work and remain resilient at times of extreme \ncrisis like the pandemic or flood. For them, it was not new to see their mother gathering for meetings, and \ndiscussions, under the SEWA banner, so the Adolescent girls were well aware that their mother worked as \na domestic worker, construction worker and agriculture worker and they are a member of SEWA and their \nmothers are organised by SEWA for their trade righteous and issues. so understanding SEWA was not hard \nfor them. During their, meetings they are encouraged to bring us their issues as an adolescent like \nmarriageable age, Sexual and Reproductive health, choice in life, education, skill and employment. \nToday in both the districts in Jharkhand, Ranchi and Hazaribagh 45 adolescent girls are part of SEWA now \nand recently by the end of the year 2021 formal meetings were conducted in both the district SEWA office \nfor the orientation of SEWA work and to find opportunities to know how to work with the Adolescent girls \nin Jharkhand. The girls were started involved in KOBO tool training (Data collection training) where they \nwill work on surveys in future to be conducted by SEWA.  \n  \nYouth Group meetings and Training \nWhile SEWA historically considers itself at the intersection of the labour movement and the women\u2019s \nmovement, the expansion of work under the Youth leadership development program has allowed us to \ndeepen our involvement in these movements through the adoption of new praxes, as well as increasing \n \n \nour integration into work around public health. We do this through expanding our core approach of rights-\nbased mobilising, and building on it through the incorporation of voices and agency of young girls who \nthen join the labour movement and the women\u2019s movement as empowered actors, right from the onset. \nKey activities that the youth girls have engaged in have been consciousness -raising and mobilising for \ncommunity issues. These have included developing a narrative around issues that young women and girls \nface regard ing health, autonomy, livelihood, and financial independence. Additionally, the girls have \nlearned how to mobilise peer groups to advocate for changes in their socio-economic conditions e.g. access \nto COVID and Polio vaccination camps, ensuring police main tained safety during the lockdown and \nlobbying for access to services and resources as per their due. They leveraged their newly acquired digital \nfluency to ensure continuous consciousness -raising amongst their peers and within their communities, \nthrough the era of social distancing. They further used these new skills to engage with relevant stakeholders \non Facebook and Whatsapp groups, and keep the spotlight on their issues, even when COVID threatened \nto displace them. \n  \nIn West Bengal, the youth group members conducted meetings on community-level issues that affected the \nlives of the youth within their community like early marriage, menstruation, hygiene and sanitation. Over \nthe grant period,  36 such meetings have been conducted. They have been involved in  raising awareness \nabout various issues like organising campaigns against child marriage. There are at present 9 active groups \ncomprising 126 members across Murshidabad and Malda working towards transforming their communities \nthrough youth-led advocacy.  \nSince young girls from Murshidabad and Malda are affected by issues of child marriage, sexual harassment, \nand increasing dropout, it was of primary importance to address the issues by making them aware of their \nrights. Total 5 training(s) have been organise d in collaboration with other organisations like Praajak and \nBhavna network through which 126 youth group members got sensitized on Protection Of Children from \nSexual Offences Act 2012, different aspects of leadership and gender equality. Through the train ing, the \nyouth group members gained knowledge concerning Child rights and developed insights on how gender \nequality challenges notions of patriarchy and how they can become effective leaders by addressing \ninequitable gender norms. The training(s)led to", "Significant changes": "significant changes which could be observed among  8-10 \ngirls as they would try to speak up at the end of the training sessions and would get more comfortable in \nexpressing their views and opinions with their peers. They would also encourage their peers to come out of \ntheir confined zones and chase their dreams. \nIn Ranchi (Jharkhand), as per demand expressed by the youth regarding their rights to safety, a session on \nlegal aspects and rights of Sexual Harassment and violence at the workplace and a knowledge session series \nhave been started. These adolescent girls are the daughters of the SEWA members of Ranchi. They are \npursuing their education from 10th to graduation. Thus this year SEWA Bharat has started organising them \ntoo to strengthen them and give them an understanding about their mothers working as unorganised workers \nand what hardship efforts they are putting to run and bear the family member\u2019s expense.   Providing them \nwith such knowledge will also help in identifying cases among the adolescent as well as older members \nwhere they do not share about their work issues whether it is wage discrimination, unfavourable work \nconditions or violence. These sessions were facilitated by AALI (Association for Advocacy and Legal \nInitiatives Trust). 31 Adolescent girls are now the 1st batch for this session. These 31 adolescent girls are \nassigned to share what they learnt from the session with other adolescent girls in their area till the next \nsession. Also, 30 Adolescent Girls from Ranchi and Hazaribagh were part of an online data collection and \nresume development training, this was to help them for developing resumes in future when they go out in \nsearch of jobs.  \n9 young girls from the tribal areas have been given training on Sohrai painting. This skill would be enhanced \nto explore earning opportunities from their local art. \nSEWA Bharat in both states recognised the need of establishing Youth clubs as a key component for the \nwork and strengthening of the greater SEWA movement. Each intervention has assisted adolescent girls in \nintegrating into society, developing stronger relationships with family members and peer groups, and, most \nimportantly, developing and appreciating their voice and, in particular, the agency they have over the \n \n \ndecisions that affect their lives. This has benefited SEWA Bharat's efforts to establish youth work as a solid \nfoundation for activities in the states, as well as to improve relationships with community members. As a \nresult, our actions last longer and have a higher impact. \n\u2014---X\u2014--- \nCapacity Building of staff \nCapacity building of local team members is essential to ensure the sustainable impact of any intervention. \nWhether it is via their contribution to constantly readapt program learnings into the program design, or \ntheir support in further building capacities of aagewans, it is the local teams that ultimately are \nresponsible for the success of an intervention.  \nVarious training(s) have been given to the team throughout the year for the team: \n\u2022 Panchyati Raj system \n\u2022 Wage and Social security code by the Joint labour commissioner \n\u2022 Labour rights and entitlements by the Right to Food network \n\u2022 The importance of Gram Sabha by the SEWA National Council \n\u2022 C- 190 Violence in the world of Work \n\u2022 E- Shram portal training \n\u2022 Understanding on New labour codes \n\u2022 Gender, poverty & Unemployment  \n\u2022 Leadership Development \n\u2022 Gender, decent work & Social Protection \n\u2022 Unorganised workers & Labour Issues \n\u2022 Leadership Development and Trade Union leader, by V .V . Giri Training Institute, facilitated by \nthe SEWA National Council  \nFor staff capacity building, the staff also participated in many virtual training sessions, like for building \nknowledge of the Sangathan perspective. International Training course\u201d Economic & Social Protection \nCourse '' These courses have helped the sta ff to understand the SEWA\u2019s work more for the members and \ntheir protection on trade, work, wage & social protection.  \nThrough the training(s) and sessions, the staff were being capacitated with the knowledge and skills required \nfor effective intervention at the field level. Evident changes were visible among the staff members as they \nbecame more informed on the rights and entitlements of the workers employed in the unorganized sector, \nand learnt about the wages and security code which plays an important part in the empowerment of workers \nand ensuring their social security. Knowledge about the Panchayat structure is fundamental in ensuring \naccess to schemes and services at the village level. Further, the information received was communicated to \nthe members th rough aagevan meetings which helped in facilitating advocacy at the Block and District \nlevel as they became conscious of their rights. For instance, In West Bengal, after knowing about the Janani \nSuraksha Yojna through the Right to Food Network training, 3 members received financial benefits through \nthe scheme. Staff are also undertaking regular visits to make the District level violence committee \nfunctional. \nAnnual Planning and Review Sessions \nThis year the field teams across both states actively took the need for having annual work plans as utmost \npriority. Beginning of each year in both 2021 and 2022, the teams prepared annual work plans and presented \nthe same to their colleagues, which in turn contributed to the development of the larger workplan for the  \nprogrammes. The team, along with support from the Central team members also supported the team by \n \n \nundertaking sessions for the development of monitoring tools for different programmes being implemented \nin the states.  \nWorkshop and sessions aimed at review, as well as for the development of the Theory of Change document, \nwhich has been crucial for understanding the work being done, as well as linking the same results to the \nlarger impact aimed through the programme.  \nMonitoring, Evaluation and Learning \nThe focus through this period has been on the development of aagevans, who have started owning the \nprocess and regularly maintain field note diaries to note their work, achievements and challenges. This \nbecomes a repository to build evidence of the aagevan capacity, issues and challenges met at the field \nlevel and the responses of the stakeholders in the local ecosystem. \nAlong with this, a key focus is on maintaining Monthly Progress Reports (MPR) by the state team, which \ncapture all programmes and projects being done in the state. These reports act as monthly trackers for all \nongoing programmes in the state and add key inputs to the larger state development plan \nMonitoring visits by the Programme Coordinator, and other programme and project coordinators, to help \nsupport state teams with various inputs needed for the functioning of the programmes, as well as the visits \ndirected towards identifying the needs for state development and prioritisation. These include visits from \ndifferent verticals across SEWA Bharat such as Communications, Research and other teams to help \nsupport the state teams with capacity building with these skills needed towards the strengthening of the \nstate. This allows for teams to continue with regular fieldwork while also understanding the larger motive \nbehind doing the activities. Input sessions with Senior leadership have also been a key input toward \nprogramme strengthening and state development. \nSystematized and regular maintenance of monitoring mechanisms and means of verifications allowed for \nefficient tracking of work: \n\u2022 Maintaining Minutes of meetings \n\u2022 Excel sheets and Google Drives to maintain the SSK data \n\u2022 Reporting of case studies \n\u2022 Reflection sessions \nAll of these contribute to a holistic approach toward state development and building different aspects \nneeded for autonomy. \n  \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1: Shortfalls \nFollowing the announcement of the second lockdown, the team shifted quickly to online modes of \ncommunication, meetings, and other activities. Although the staff was acclimated to online sessions, the \nuptake was accompanied by the time required to adjust. \nSEWA believes that a key component in the work aimed at aagevan development is the component of \nexposure visits, which could not be undertaken in both states due to lockdown restrictions, and this added \nto aagevans taking time in owning the entire process of becoming change agents for the community, and \nfully transforming into their leadership roles. \nOverall, we noted a slowdown in activities, which we believe is related to mental fatigue among the staff \nas a result of stagnant work and delayed processes, which has resulted in a lack of enthusiasm and interest \nin the work, particularly with field-level operations, which are becoming more difficult due to continued \nCOVID restrictions and are exposing the underlying vulnerabilities among our members. This disrupts a \ngrassroots people-based organisation, slowing down the program's progress. \n \n \nAs a result, such situations are handled with a thorough engagement with the desired outcome and \nreflection sessions, which allow teams to revisit the objectives of engaging in activities that could become \nmonotonous. \nFor Bengal, the shortfall is due to the ongoing deterioration of beedi workers' conditions, the adoption of \nthe labour code, and other factors that have demotivated beedi workers and aagevans. As this appears to \nbe a setback for years of advocacy and interaction with our members, who are now suffering as a result of \npolicy changes and a decline in beedi work in the country. \nJharkhand observed that, despite having digital tools offered to Aagevan, frequent monitoring of tool use \nbecomes difficult, and its maintenance has become an additional duty, aggravated due to a lack of \ninfrastructure and public resources. \n  \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 \nTo empower communities through access to information and entitlements with the help of the SEWA \nShakti Kendras [SEWA empowerment centres] in Jharkhand and West Bengal \n \n \n7.2.b. Objective 2: Principal accomplishments \nSEWA operates empowerment centres known as SEW A Shakti Kendras in all districts across the two \nstates. SEWA's presence and operations in communities are anchored on the SSKs. They connect \ncommunity people with government programmes and schemes related to microfinance, health, job, and \nskill development opportunities, and they provide resources, support, and information to women for their \neconomic and social growth. The SSK is also important as a last-mile delivery mechanism for social \nsecurity and welfare systems, supporting women and their families in accessing them. These centres, \nwhich are staffed by a woman from the local community, give assurance and assistance to help women \nnegotiate the application processes and receive public welfare benefits. \nSEWA Shakti Kendra acts as a bridge between the government and the community members. Through the \nSSK community members became aware not only of their rights but also of the way to access them. \nAt present, through the programme, the states have developed around 8 SSKs under the OAK programme, \noverall 9 SSKs at present supported through various programmes. The inputs given have bolstered the \nSSK in ensuring \n\u2022 An increased outreach, covering wider schemes and ensuring maximum benefits are received \nthrough the Kendras, while also including the expansion of services by catering to the community \nneeds through camps, aagevan mobilisation, and door-to-door visits \n\u2022 Inputs towards the development of staff capacity on handling multiple aspects attached to the \nSSK, along with developing the SSK In-charge by identifying young leaders in the community. \n\u2022 Working towards stronger connections with stakeholders, and relevant government departments. \n\u2022 Regularised and centralised database management system. \nThe major accomplishment has been to nudge the SEWA Shakti Kendras towards sustainability and \nensuring by the end of the grant Year 1, 60-65% growth across all aspects mentioned above. \n  \nIncreasing access to Social security schemes through strengthening  SSKs \n \n \nIn West Bengal, over the grant period, 26518 linkages have been facilitated with various social security and \nwelfare schemes through the SSKs across Murshidabad and Malda. The SSKs played a significant role in \nproviding information and enabling access to government schemes and services. Out of the total linkages \ncarried out 6790 linkages have been initiated by the agewans, 2500 by the youths and 17228 by Organisers \nand SSK-in charge thereby ensuring fulfilment of rights and entitlements of the beneficiaries by facilitating \ntheir access to welfar e schemes which is essential in reducing their vulnerabilities and ensuring better \nstandards of living. \nThe impact of the SEWA Shakti Kendras can truly be understood through the instances of benefits received \nby the members and their families: \nBandana Haldar, who is from a small village in Murshidabad's Lalgola block, is a beedi roller; her husband \nis a construction worker, and she has two daughters in school. Due to the pandemic-induced threats of wage \nloss, the family was finding it difficult to spend on their children's education. At this point, she accessed the \nSSK and learned about the scholarship facility available under the SSY programme. She had previously \nbeen affiliated with the SSY scheme, which made applying for the scholarship easier. Her eldest  daughter \nMandira received the scholarship amount after successfully filling out and submitting the form with the \nassistance of the SEWA organisers. She is now able to continue her studies. \nJohra Khatun is a beneficiary of the state-run Swasthya sathi scheme which is a health insurance scheme, \nshe was linked with the scheme in the year 2021. Her husband\u2019 s entire treatment for the hydrocele \noperation was covered under the scheme. \n  \nIn Jharkhand, by linking our members with social security schemes that may cover their trade-related \nissues, over 2500 linkages have been facilitated with various social security and welfare schemes across \nRanchi and Hazaribagh. The members are connected to Building and other Construction workers board, \nUnorganised Workers Board, supported through seed linkage for agriculture worker members and Health \nscheme linkage. \nMore than 1600 forms were received for the BOCW application but after documentation verification, only \n984 forms were filled and submitted and 849 were accepted by the Labour office (Labour office only \naccepts those forms who have proper Aadhar card detail, residential of Ranchi zone, proper bank details \nwithout any IFSC issue if this is fulfilled the forms are accepted ) after the verification and out of it 411 \neligible applicants (Who have already received one benefit but have not submitted the bills of purchasing \ntools and safety kit are not allowed to get the further benefits, not all are eligible for Maternity fund \nbenefit, it is applicable only up to, 1st & 2nd Child, not all are eligible for their children who can avail \nthe scholarship form)filled their benefit form under BoCW and 126 have received their benefit of Safety \nkit and tool kit scheme.  \nApart from BOCW other trades like domestic workers, home-based workers, agriculture workers, forest \nworkers, etc can also get themselves enrolled under the Unorganised workers' board, thus 237 members \nenrolled themselves this year.  \n  \nTraining(s) and Inputs \nMany sessions conducted for awareness of scheme and benefits for linking the members and mainly \nemphasising understanding the importance of each scheme has been crucial, and so far in the last year the \nmembers were connected to several schemes like BOCW, Unorganised workers board, Renewal of \nBOCW, Caste Income residential, PAN Card, Sukanya Samridhi Yojna, Ayushman Card, Agriculture seed \nlinkages, Bank accounts related work and facilitating in other works like online and offline form filling.  \nTraining and Capacity Building of staff: \nOver the years, multiple kinds of training(s) have been identified which are crucial for the staff \n \n \n\u2022 Orientation - a deeper and in-depth understanding of the essence of having SSKs as physical \nstructures within the community, and how they play a vital role in bolstering the SEWA \nSangathan \n\u2022 Needs assessment and Engagement of the community - imperative to understand and develop the \nability to identify members' issues \n\u2022 Digital Literacy \n\u2022 Engagement with government departments - this allows for faster results to be extracted. \n  \nDigital Upgradation and Real-time Data generation \nThe continual upgrade in governance processes, which are now being updated to include digital \ntechnologies, requires SSKs to modernise themselves with digital technology. To standardise the \nprocesses, the SSK has been supported with adequate infrastructures, such as a computer system or a \nlaptop, along with internet connectivity. With a system at the centre, the SSK's process and data \nmanagement have become more methodical. For smooth operation, the team receives continual digital \ncapacity building. With increasing distances between communities and governance centres, SSKs serve a \ncrucial role in connecting community members with various government departments. \n\u2022 Coordination, monitoring and supervision- Using WhatsApp and phone calls, both state teams \nhave been in touch with one another to keep abreast with work progress, troubleshoot when \nhurdles are encountered in the field as well as share positive stories of impact. \n\u2022 Data entry and online form filling- The primary use of technology has been in the data entry and \nreporting process \u2013 both for internal reporting as well as in the process of applying for various \nsocial security schemes in various government departments. \nThis had allowed for the creation of databases which can generate data needed for furthering any social \nsecurity agenda with relevant stakeholders, and allows for SEWA\u2019S internal monitoring structures to be \nstreamlined. The same has been attached to the report. \n  \nSSK acts as a safe space for community women  \nApart from providing information and assistance related to Government schemes and services, community \nwomen also access the SSK to share their everyday problems and seek support in resolving issues at the \nindividual and community level. Each centre thus serves as the neighbourhood hub where the community \nmembers feel free to drop in and seek clarity on a range of issues. The SSKs also engage with youth in the \narea and promote youth groups or Yuva mandals that become active as community-based organisations in \nthe area. They take up issues of hygiene and cleanliness in the area and assist the SSK in conducting various \nactivities. They also support girls\u2019 education, educate and mobilize against early marriages and work for \ngender equality in general. Most importantly, they become stakeholders in the SSK and are trained to ensure \nthe sustainability of the SSK. \n  \nFacilitating access to schemes and services through Home visits \nDue to the pandemic, there were restrictions on group meetings, hence one to one engagement was given \nmore priority. The Aagewans were assigned the responsibility to reach at least 15 to 20 members per day \neither through phone calls or door-to-door visits. Health-related guidelines and videos were shared through \nthe WhatsApp group.  \nThe agewans played an active role in their community during the time of crisis by identifying families who \nneed ration, registering members for vaccination and sensitizing community members on COVID-19 safety \nprotocols. \n \n \nDevelopment of IEC materials: SEWA published a small booklet on MGNREGA to create awareness about \nthe ACT. Through this booklet, women can demand their actual rights to get the food amount from the \npublic distribution system. \nSuch materials act as collaterals for information dissemination, which entail compiling all relevant details \nsuccinctly and interactively which is easy to grasp by the larger community. \n  \nActivities are done through SSK \nSocial Security Camps in West Bengal:  \nThrough Social security camps, community members are provided with necessary information on specific \ngovernment schemes and assisted with linkages. Through these camps, it is being ensured that an \nincreasing number of members can be linked with the social security schemes run by the state or central \ngovernment which can contribute to their well being in the long run.  \nE-shram card \nDuring the grant period,18 camps were conducted across Malda and Murshidabad on the E-shram \ncard which is an initiative by the Government of India which aims to create a database of \nunorganised workers. A total of 3837 members were registered on the portal through the camp. \nSamajik Suraksha Yojna (SSY)  \n2 camps were organized on SSY which is a state-run scheme to integrate the different schemes \nand to offer uniform benefits to all unorganised workmen to help them face every exigency of \nlife. The scheme has recently been upgraded to Bina Mulay Samajik Suraksha Yojna (BMSY) and \nits registration is expected to begin this year.  150 members who were already linked with the \nSSY scheme were assisted through the camp in updating their existing forms. \nFever Testing Camp in collaboration with Health Department \nAs the cases of COVId-19 peaked during the second wave of the pandemic, a fever testing camp \nwas held where frontline workers including ASHA and ANM were present. 23 members of the \ncommunity got tested through this camp. \n  \nGovernment Liaisoning for linkages in Jharkhand: \nMembers visited the Kendras for various linkages such as caste certificates, income-related documents, and \nresidential and PAN Card, but they were referred to Pragya Kendra, a total of 51 services were facilitated \nby the SSK. Under the Anganwadi Centre in Hazaribagh, a total of 121 forms were filled for Sukanya \nSamridhi Yojna, which are still under process. The SSK team ensure regular follow-ups with the Anganwadi \nSupervisor for each case. More than 80 members are linked with the Ayushman Card linkage campaign in \nHazaribagh and 68 members were facilitated in bank account work by SSK. And more than 90 members \nwere facilitated in filling out online & Offline forms. The agriculture workers with several 297 were linked \nwith Block/ATMA/PACS for seed linkage during Kharif & Rabbi season.  \nBy the end of 2021 from November to December, in both the districts again a registration campaign was \nconducted on E-Shram Portal registration and more than 1000 from both the districts.  \n  \nImpact  \nThe SSKs not only bridge the gap between the grassroots and governance centres but also encourages the \ncommunity members to participate in the governance. The centres  also hold continuous community \nmeetings where the members come together and discuss their issues and explore ways to solve them. Along \nwith these meetings, there are various kinds of training to happen at these centres. There are financial \nliteracy training, entrepreneurship development training, digital literacy training, empowerment training \nand workshops educating the members about health, healthy lifestyle and hygiene. It is because of the SSKs \n \n \nthat the centres of governance are accountable and the com munity members are voicing their needs. The \ntraining, workshop, and awareness campaigns by the SSK centres have empowered the women with the \nknowledge of various governance schemes, and skills and boosted confidence throughout the whole \nprocess. \n  \nTeleconsultation - COVID relief support \nDuring the wake of the second wave of COVID-19, healthcare access became difficult due to the \noverburdened healthcare infrastructure. A teleconsultation model was implemented which aimed to \nconnect women in the field with trained medical experts. In this model, the role of aagevan was seen as \nessential as it is only because of her presence that the community members trusted unknown doctors with \npersonal, medical information, especially given the current socio-political climate. Through this \nmodel,  across the two states, 59 aagevans were strengthened as Master Trainers for dissemination of \ninformation in their respective communities, resulting in 13,723 awareness calls being made by \ncommunity members, to a team of 7 active doctors available.   \nA dashboard which was updated on daily basis was monitored by a central health team created, led by \nSusan ben (National Health Coordinator, SEWA) \n  \nWorking in collaboration with Right to Food Network to secure the fundamental rights of life-food \nand work \nSEWA in West Bengal collaborated with the Right to  Food Network to advocate the aspects of Right to \nFood and other government schemes that are directly or indirectly related to ensuring food security. One \nOrganiser from Murshidabad is now being given the responsibility to work with the network activity to  \nensure food security is ensured to the most vulnerable group. As a part of the campaign, help desks were \nalso being set up from where community members can get information related to schemes and services \nprovided by the government. They have also surveyed  to analyse the impact of COVID -19 on the most \nvulnerable section, the findings of which will be used for advocacy at the state and national levels. Through \nthe network activities, members' access to food security is being ensured. \n  \nVLCPC Strengthening  \nThe role of VLCPC is fundamental in making duty bearers accountable for the protection of child rights \nand addressing issues of child rights violations. As the VLCPC meetings could not be held regularly due to \nthe pandemic, the other hand, the child rights  violation cases were also rising. At this point, agewans and \norganisers in West Bengal intervened and approached the committee to regularize VLCPC meetings to \nsensitize the community members to prevent/ reduce the early marriage because during the pandemic early \nmarriage rate was high in West Bengal. 15 meetings were held where discussions centred around early \nmarriage, increasing dropout rate among girls and action plans were formulated to address the issues. \n  \nCapacity Building towards inclusive centres \nThe most important strengths of these SSKs are the human resources personnel that are responsible for \nthe functioning of the SSKs. Every SSK consists of a team of SSK in-charge, Field Mobilizer, Supervisor \nand Aagewans. The SSKs which are close to each other share their supervisor. With a strong monthly \nreporting system which helps the SSK to track their linkages in place, SSKs can function smoothly. The \nSSKs have a grievance redressal mechanism through which the members can solve their grievances if \nany. A continuously developing and evolving database of all the local, state and central government \nprogrammes through which the community members could be linked helps the SSK teams to support the \ncommunity members better. This developing database gives information about the programme, eligibility, \nrequired documents, and the application process too. This keeps the SSKs informed about the \n \n \ndevelopments in government policies and programmes through which they could link the community \nmembers. \nDeveloping Youth champions through SSKs \nThe SSK has also evolved as space and medium for nurturing local communities. A recent initiative by \nthe SSK team has been on building the capacity of the daughters of SEWA's members. They have been \ntrained to expand the development work in their communities, and have played the role of building trust \namong their community members towards the services offered by SSKs. \n  \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2: Shortfalls \nThe major challenge both states witnessed was an overall priority shift across the social security sphere in \nIndia due to the ongoing COVID pandemic was towards Health, and every other scheme was halted either \ndue to the closing of government offices, or the importance of Health benefits, which led to a major \nadaptation needed towards centring activities in sync with the Health priority.  \nThis is accompanied by challenges faced by the SSK setup due to external factors, such as:  \n\u2022 Repeated transfer of government officials at block/district level \nAlong with internal challenges, like: \n\u2022 Difficulty in identifying trained staff from the grassroots, with a certain desirable skillset needed \nfor understanding the needs and operations for the SSK and the larger social security ambit in \nIndia \n\u2022 Data entry and monitoring are hindered by infrastructure challenges, and a lack of availability of \nresources, which led to many delays in real-time data generation. \nFor West Bengal, \n\u2022 Social security schemes like SSY could not be accessed for a specific period as the portal was \nunder repair, which led to a hurried and hasty application process, leading to many not being able \nto register in the year 2021. \n\u2022 As the government has started to complete the forms online, E-shram registration was also \nadministered online. However, due to the pressure of many registrations taking place at the same \ntime, the members have returned many times. They were compelled to register in the early \nmorning or late evening. The shift to digital space acts as a hindrance in registering for the \nschemes and services.  \n\u2022 Although the state government introduced the Duare Sarkar scheme (govt at your doorsteps) \nprogram, people are hardly accessing the schemes after submission of the forms regularly. \nJharkhand \n\u2022 The SSK linkage was only started to post the second COVID lockdown. Pre lockdown awareness \nsessions & camps were not conducted due to state guidelines.  \n\u2022 Conducting camps, especially in interior rural areas is challenging for the internet, electricity but \nit is also challenging to bring all the members to Pragya Kendra for linkages especially for \nAyushman card, Aadhar card, caste income residential, as there is a mobility issue.  \n\u2022 The fingerprint issue is decreasing linkages in Ayushman and Aadhar Card \n \n \n\u2022 The BoCW board also asks members to renew themselves every year and to get it done is very \nchallenging to continue members to get renewed thus this year the focus was also to make \napplicants sensitised on getting renewed every year for proper scheme benefit linkages.  \n  \nHowever, all these challenges and shortfalls were addressed at a ste ady pace without avoiding delays in \nensuring the benefits are provided to our members. \n  \n \n \n7.3.a. Objective 3 \nTo collectivise women workers [beedi workers, domestic workers, construction workers, street \nvendors, agricultural workers] to enable them to better engage with stakeholders in the value chain \nfor full employment and have better access to markets and resources \n \n \n7.3.b. Objective 3: Principal accomplishments \nWomen workers in the informal sector suffer from a multitude of challenges, one of which is that their \nwork and their contribution to the labour force is rather unreported, and hence not valued appropriately. \nOne of the ways SEWA has brought recognition to the issues and rights of these women is by the dual \naction of organising and collectivism. This type of mobilisation is guided by two realms that are close to \nthe informal women worker i.e. community based and trade-based.  \n  \nTrade Committee meetings:  \n  \nSEWA Bengal has also formed trade committees for beedi rollers and weavers  and the committees hold \nmeetings and discuss trade-specific issues and jointly formulate action plans to address the issues. A total \nof 5 Trade committee meetings were organised in Murshidabad with  106 members where the discussion \ncentred around trade-related issues including low wages, limited access to healthcare, and social security \nand the formulation of an action plan to address the issues through advocacy at the Block and District level. \nSimilar activities have been conducted in Jharkhand, where Trade committee Groups/Members have taken \nthe issues ahead and an equal amount of time has also been dedicated to creating an understanding of their \nresponsibilities and functions by the committee members to ensure positive impact. The  SEWA National \nCouncil has also guided to make the trade committee members functional by participating in their regular \nmeetings.  \n  \nMulti-Stakeholder Consultations: \n  \nA series of important stakeholder meetings were organised by SEWA in West Bengal with government \nrepresentatives. In Berhampore, a meeting was conducted to discuss trade-related issues of beedi rollers \nwhere the Assistant Labor Commissioner, members of the different trade unions, Mahajan and aagewans \nwere present. A joint action plan was formulated to address the issues faced by beedi rollers. It has been \ndecided that the Unions along with SEWA Bharat in West Bengal will draft a letter and submit it to the \nLabour Minister.  \n \n \nIn Malda, another meeting was organised in  Manikchak, Malda in the presence of Block Level \nrepresentatives from various government departments including NRLM, MGNREGA, and CITU as well \nas the private sector including representatives of Pataka beedi company and Mahajan. This meeting gave \na platform for our sisters to directly share their trade-related issues with a variety of important stakeholders. \nThe stakeholders addressed the issues raised by our sisters and also discussed various skill -based training \nwhich can provide an alternate means of livelihood. \nOn the 23rd of March SEWA Bharat in Jharkhand along with other two organisations, Gharelu Kamgar \nSangathan & Nirmana, stood for the rights of domestic workers to be considered and performed a \ndemonstration in front of Raj Bhavan in Ranchi with the demands.  More than 30 domestic workers \nparticipated in the demonstration and a few SEWA members also spoke for their rights. A demand letter \n(mentioning, the rectification of ILO convention 189 by the Central government and bringing law for the \ndomestic workers in India, decent wage to be provided by employers, social security schemes to be \nintroduced more for the domestic workers and to be treated well with dignity in their workplace) was \nsubmitted to the MPs of Jharkhand. ILO convention points were highlighted.  \nThe National Platform for Domestic Workers (NPDW) provided an opportunity for the domestic worker \nrepresentatives to participate and learn to mobilise and organise domestic workers to stand for their \nrights in Jharkhand . Through the platform, the domestic workers also learnt about their part of the \nresponsibilities to achieve a conducive workplace. In 2021, two domestic workers from Jharkhand, Pinki \nMinj & Swarnlata Devi (Swarnlata Ben is also a state domestic worker representative), along with Anisha \nBen (SEWA Sathi, a domestic worker Mobiliser) participated. The NPDW conducted a two-day workshop \nfor the SEWA domestic worker and facilitated conversation on minimum wage, rate chart and social security \naspects. A few highlights of the workshop: \n\u2022 The domestic worker representative had to present their work done in the state and it was decided \nto mobilise in new areas/basis through which 300 new domestic workers will be organised in \n2022.  \n\u2022 Through the NPDW, SEWA Jharkhand is now able to connect with other organisations working \nfor the domestic workers and raising voices in front of the government for the domestic workers.  \n  \nPromoting Alternative Livelihoods: \nWest Bengal \nOrientation on short term training courses under Gramdyog Vikas Yojna, KVIC  \nAgewans and community members were oriented on various short term training courses under Gramodyog \nVikas Yojana. Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) is a statutory body under the Ministry of \nMSME, Govt. of India that works towards providing employment, producing saleable articles and creating \nself-reliance amongst the poor and building up a strong rural community spirit. The meeting was attended \nby agewans and community women as well as youth group members from all blocks of Murshidabad and \nMalda. \nSkill-based Training \nSEWA Bharat in West Bengal has been running SEWA Youth Resource Centres in Murshidabad focusing \non providing alternative livelihood training (mainly tailoring) to get young girls out of beedi rolling. In both \nSYRCs, one special class has been added for advanced training. In the 2021 -22 financial year, 198 girls \nreceived tailoring training. A total of 51 girls have moved completely out of beedi rolling and into garment \nmaking.  \nEncouraging Social Entrepreneurship  \nTo promote sustainable livelihood, SEWA Bharat in Raghunathganj block with the sup port of a locally \nplaced SBI fellow initiated a project on small scale production and marketing of a snack item locally known \nas Nimki, currently, 3 women are being supported in running this project and scaling it up to a sustainable \nsocial enterprise owned by the community women. \n \n \nJharkhand \nA discussion on alternative livelihoods with agriculture workers cum forest worker members, aagewans and \nadolescent girls yielded a few opportunities - such as producing leaf plates, engaging in animal husbandry, \nand organising skill training for adolescent girls.  \nBiodegradable leaf plates and bowls \nIn the Daru Block, a 10 group of agriculture worker-members developed a team to work on leaf plates and \nbowl stitching during leaf season and the local SEWA team will explore market linkages with local vendors \nin Jhumra. A demo with ten women was conducted in September-October, 2021, right before Dusherra Puja. \nThis was the first opportunity for those 10 women to make a living using locally available resources. This \nwas a big motivation for the local team as well - setting an example of nurturing the local economy. This \nopportunity will be explored further to check for viability and scale.  \nAnimal Husbandry \nExploring further livelihood opportunities within the agriculture secto r is one way to go - in Hazaribagh, \nAnimal husbandry work is of equal importance as the women struggle with good practices when it comes \nto cattle rearing (cow, goat, buffalo, hen). There is substantial scope for augmenting the existing incomes \nof women engaged in animal husbandry if such practices are adopted. Currently, bringing their animals to \nthe veterinary doctors is a challenge and has caused animal deaths in many cases. In late 2021, SEWA \nBharat started a program to develop 10 Pashu Sakhis in Hazari bagh. These Pashu Sakhis from different \nvillages can then cater to SEWA members in keeping their goats healthy by providing first aid and guiding \nthem and in preparing good quality fodder (Pashu Aahar) for them. SEWA Bharat also called in an expert \nteam from Bihar that visited Hazaribagh in December 2021 and February 2022 and a 10 -day session was \nconducted consisting of both a classroom session and field exposure. Today,  the 10 Pashu Sakhi are actively \nworking in their local and neighbouring villages. Incr ease of monthly income in the range of INR 900 to \nINR 1500 has been reported by the Pashu Sakhis.  \nSkill Training for Adolescent Girls \nThe team in Hazaribagh has recently begun to work on the skill development of Adolescent girls to prepare \nthem for connecting with income sources while they are pursuing their education. 9 adolescent girls have \nbeen trained in Sohrai painting (the famous Jharkhand art) through one of the renowned organisations called \n\u201c Sohrai Kala Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samittee '' in Hazaribagh. These girls have completed their training in \nMarch 2022 and continue to practice. Once their skill is developed, SEWA Bharat will support these girls \nto market their paintings through \u201cAnubandh\u201d which is an online SEWA e -marketplace. Other interested \nSEWA members too can join this training.  \nEntering the Digital World \nIn SEWA Jharkhand, adolescent girls are today given a platform for understanding digital tools as a means \nof livelihood. 5 girls from Hazaribagh & Ranchi have been trained in conducting online surveys and have \nbeen able to make an earning of more than INR 5000 each. The purpose of providing them with this training \nis to meet the growing need of collecting primary data, through digital means as has been deemed necessary \nduring the pandemic. Many CSOs and government organisations seek such data. \n  \n \n \n7.3.c. Objective 3: Shortfalls \nThe continuous waves of COVID- 19 pandemic and everlasting restrictions and safety guidelines, along \nwith the lack of market and livelihood opportunities have affected the income cycle of the unorganised \nsectors. The situation continued to deteriorate with each passing Day making revenues of livelihood \nscarce and resources limited. \n \n \nThe situation is further aggravated by the ongoing debate around labour codes in India whereby there is \nno concrete support for the workers under the various labour codes at present. Specifically, the facilities \nof the beedi workers have been cut down through the code. They are the victims of the double burden. \nAlthough the state government every six months reviews the minimum wages for the beedi workers. \nHowever, in West Bengal, the minimum wages are fixed through the tripartite meeting and these \nminimum wages are much lower than the government\u2019s fixed minimum wages.  \nOn the other hand in Jharkhand, the major challenge witnessed is the lack of interest of members to invest \nin full-day trainings, as it results in loss of livelihoods,  therefore they do not seem to understand the \nlarger objective behind providing those training, thereby defeating the purpose of capacity building \n  \n \n \n \n8.", "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project?": "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project? \nThough the pandemic has challenged every aspect of our daily lives, and especially that of informal women \nworkers, it has helped us rethink and restrategize design and implementation at the community level.  \n\u2022 The agewans played the role of SEWA\u2019s front line workers, taking on the risk to reach each \nmember to ensure they have access to food and health services during the pandemic. They \nconducted door to door visits while there were mobility restrictions and supported relief work by \nidentifying ultra vulnerable families from their communities. SEWA in West Bengal worked \ncollaboratively with Right to Food Network to advocate for food security of the marginalised. \n\u2022 The shift to the digital modes of work necessitated by the lockdown spurred a change to adopt \ndigital literacy for the local teams and agewans. Online training was organised with agewans, \nyouth members as well as the local SEWA teams to make sure the work doesn't stop. The use of \nvirtual means of meeting such as Zoom and Google Meets was adopted. The agewans also led the \nteleconsultation service provided by SEWA for virtual help and treatment. While the pandemic \nthreatened the necessities including \u2018food, clothing and shelter\u2019, it also made it certain that \nproviding financial literacy to women is paramount if they want to acquire financial management \nskills to help them to cope with economic shocks. \n\u2022 The pandemic exacerbated poverty and hunger pushing people into the vicious cycle of economic \nstagnation. To meet the challenges posed by the pandemic SEWA in West Bengal tried to explore \nopportunities for income generation by collaborating with Khadi Village Industries. This will \nallow the team to increase their focus on the skill development of members and pivot to \nalternative livelihoods if needed.  \n\u2022 With an increase in cases of early and forced child marriages owing to the pandemic, the youth \ngroup members have been vigilant within their communities to prevent child marriages and raise \nawareness among their peers.  \n\u2022 The project enabled the local teams to focus on record keeping and maintaining member \ndatabases. The team has understood the importance of capturing outcomes and not just \noutreach, which is important to constantly question our key assumptions, and use program \nlearnings to inform program design.  \n\u2022 Both states have acknowledged extending handholding support to the agewans and adolescent \ngirls. For instance, this cadre will form the second generation of SEWA Jharkhand which is \ncrucial to ensure the sustainability of development programmes in the state. The team has learnt \nthat it is equally important to collaborate with other local actors - be it government bodies or \nrepresentatives such as ASHA workers, or Elected Women Representatives (EWRs) to create a \nconducive ecosystem.  \n \n \n\u2022 NITI Consultancy, an external organisation was introduced to SEWA Bharat by OAK Foundation, \nto improve internal data systems and monitoring practices.  \n \n \n9.", "How will your team use this information to change the way you work?": "How will your team use this information to change the way you work? \n\u2022 Both teams will focus on improving the interface with government authorities to ensure the \nfulfilment of the rights of beedi workers, domestic workers, agricultural workers and domestic \nworkers. For instance, the West Bengal team will continue to advocate for linking beedi workers \nwith the Provident Fund by conducting stakeholders meetings at the block and district level, and \nensuring strong follow up. Another example relevant for both states is to prepare a comprehensive \nrate chart for domestic workers to reduce exploitation at the workplace and ensure fair wages. \n\u2022 To ensure optimum impact and sustainable change, continuing to invest in the capacity building \nand empowerment of agewans is vital.  \n\u2022 The teams will strengthen collaboration with the District level child protection unit to regularise \nVLCPC meetings at the block level and involve youth groups in creating awareness and \nreducing the rate of early marriage within the intervention area. \n\u2022 It is important to further explore what digitisation means for the informal sector, including the \nimplications of going digital for women workers in the informal economy. The objective here is \nto ensure that they are not left behind and to fully understand the digital space to further their \nlivelihoods.  \n \n \n10.", "How will you share what you have learned inside and outside your organisation?": "How will you share what you have learned inside and outside your organisation? \n\u2022 At the organisational level, the team will ensure that the learnings of the program are introduced \nand shared with aagewans, to ensure that monitoring and learning exercises are democratic and \nmost effective. Similarly, the team will amplify the learnings of the program with other state \nteams, allowing them to exchange best practices, as well as reflect on their program designs.  \n\u2022 SEWA Bharat also organised a webinar partnership with the Ministry of Micro, Small and \nMedium Enterprises, Government of India, titled \u201dWomen Micro-Entrepreneurs in the Informal \nEconomy: Resilience and Growth''. More than 230 persons participated in the event to hear \npresentations by experts in the field including the Secretary, m/o MSME and India Leads of UN \nWomen and USAID. A film featured during the webinar \u201cVoices from the Ground'' showcased \nthe stories of three microentrepreneurs including Basmati ben from Jharkhand who represent \nthousands of women microentrepreneurs who have fought adversities and dreamt of building a \nself-reliant future. Their journeys show that the right kind of support in the form of credit, access \nto affordable childcare and healthcare, linkages to the market, and financial and digital literacy \ncreates a holistic ecosystem for women microentrepreneurs within the informal economy to grow. \nThis film was also shared with the state teams so that the field mobilizers could use it to \nencourage entrepreneurial spirits among informal women workers. \n\u2022 SEWA Bharat runs a fortnightly newsletter that features highlights, achievements and learning \nfrom various programmes and collaborations which is shared with a multitude of stakeholders. \n \n \n \n \n \n11.

Progress. \n \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \n Summary: \nIn 2022, Pratham expanded into North Bengal with a focus on providing vocational training to \nyouth from tea garden communities in Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, and \nAlipurduar districts. The strategic location of the project also ties well with Pratham\u2019s intention to \nexpand its presence in the East and North-Eastern parts of India. \nKey Outcomes: \nThe program significantly impacted the lives of tea garden youth, offering them stable employment \nwith salaries ranging from Rs. 9,500 to Rs. 14,264 per month, along with accommodation and food. \nCommunity engagement initiatives, including tool-kit exhibitions and camps, fostered trust and \nenhanced foundational skills in reading, math, and English among children and youth in tea garden \ncommunities. Collaborations with organizations like Transform Trade, Swaniti Initiatives, FPA, \nNazdeeq, and KABIL enhanced community mobilization and resource-sharing efforts. Pratham's \nfunding efforts from CSR initiatives, HNIs, and foundations are poised to further strengthen this \nintervention, ensuring sustainability. \nIn summary, Pratham's expansion into North Bengal in its first year of the multi-year grant has \nmade substantial progress towards its objectives of providing vocational training, securing formal \nemployment, and fostering community engagement in tea garden communities. The program has \ntransformed individual lives but also laid the foundation for lasting positive impacts on the region's \nyouth and their families in the coming years of the intervention. \nThe communities residing in North Bengal face precarious living conditions, largely reliant on \nemployment opportunities presented by tea plantation owners. Challenges such as meager wages, \nseasonal employment fluctuations, constraints imposed by plantation owners, and a dearth of \nalternative income avenues have long been endemic. Pratham's proactive approach seeks to address \nthese issues directly by engaging with the youth of tea garden areas. Keeping in mind the niche \nchallenges of human trafficking faced by the tea-garden communities, the program embeds special \ncounseling sessions and end-to-end migration support for youth who get placed out of their district. \nThis in-turns is geared towards tackling the issue of unsafe migration and trafficking. \nPratham's commitment extends beyond North Bengal, as we aim to expand our endeavors \nthroughout West Bengal, informed by our ongoing programs and a deep understanding of industry \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \ndemands and community needs. The set target for the current year involves training 320 youth from \ntea garden regions, endowing them with the skills and knowledge necessary for thriving within \nindustry-specific job placements. The aim is to secure industry-relevant job opportunities for 80% \nof these trained individuals, effectively creating a transformative impact on both individual lives \nand the larger community. \nIn introducing the vocational training vertical within this new geography, we strategically leveraged \nour existing network to establish a presence. The selection of the training center\u2019s location was \nmeticulously considered, with factors like proximity to the tea-garden communities, availability of \nessential infrastructure, and a high demand for vocational training playing pivotal roles in the \ndecision-making process. Prior to setting up the establishment, we engaged with various \nstakeholders, including the local community, government authorities, local NGOs, and potential \nemployers, funding partnerships that would later prove instrumental. \nThe initial activities undertaken were encompassing site preparation, recruitment of staff, \ncurriculum development tailored to local needs, and an extensive marketing and outreach campaign \nto create awareness within the community. To mobilize youth for training, a multifaceted approach \nwas adopted, involving community engagement and awareness drives in collaboration with local \nNGOs. \nThrough this meticulous planning and execution, over the past 10 months, the project has \nsuccessfully trained 321 youths, with 98% of them securing placements across various states, \nhighlighting its impactful contribution to skill development and employment in the region. \n  \nQuantitative Indicators: \nTrade Training \nTarget \nEnrolle\nd \nTraining \nComplete\nd \nTraining \nOngoing \nDropped \nout Trained% Placement \nTarget Placed Placed% \nAutomoti\nve 160 165 138   25 86% 120 92 77% \nHospitalit\ny 160 269 183 33 29 114% 120 143 119% \nTotal 320 434 321 33 54 100% 240 235 98% \n  \nInsights: \nFor Auto 4W trade, students have secured placements in companies like Yazaki India Pvt Ltd, India \nJapan Lighting Pvt. Ltd, Baxy Limited, Best Koki Automotive Private Limited, Osl Tata Motors, \nTopsel Toyota, and A.K Automatics mostly in the manufacturing industry as machine operators or \nassistant technicians. These positions are offering salaries of Rs. 11,000 along with food and, in \nsome cases, traveling allowances. \nIn the Hospitality trade, students have been placed in renowned establishments like Mayfair \nHimalayan Spa Resort, ITC Grand Chole, Hotel Bodhi Palace, The Landmark Hotel, Lemon Tree \nPremier, and Summit Hermon Hotel & Spa. The highest salary offered here is Rs. 14,264/-, and \nsalaries typically of Rs. 9,500, along with accommodation and food for the role of Room \nAttendants. \nThe composition of enrolled students exhibits a gender imbalance, with 173 females and 278 males, \ntotaling 451 students. There is a significant importance in implementing strategies to foster gender \ninclusivity within vocational training programs, aiming to encourage greater female participation. \nFurthermore, the distribution of students based on their highest education qualification illustrates a \ndiverse educational landscape among participants, with 239 having completed their education up to \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \nthe 11th and 12th grades and 185 possessing educational backgrounds ranging from the 8th to the \n10th grade. Consequently, there is a need for customized training approaches that can cater to this \neducational diversity effectively. In terms of economic inclusion, a substantial majority of students \n(242) report monthly incomes below 5,000, emphasizing the program's appeal to economically \ndisadvantaged individuals. Nevertheless, the absence of students with incomes exceeding 20,000 \nsuggests a potential opportunity to broaden the program's reach to participants from a more \nextensive income spectrum. \nPlacements have been made in various states for both the Auto 4W and Hospitality programs. For \nAuto 4W, placements are present in 9 districts across Haryana, Rajasthan, and West Bengal. The \nHospitality program has placements in states like Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Sikkim, \nTamil Nadu, and West Bengal. \nQualitative Insights: The team has made multiple observations during visits to the community and \nindustry partners over the last 10 months. The following are some key insights from their \nobservations: \nCommunity Level Insights \nA team of 8 mobilization mentors conducted various community engagement activities - meetings \nand discussions with ICDS, Self-Help Groups, Parents and youth on a daily basis across the tea \ngarden communities of the 5 districts to spread awareness about vocational education led \nemployment pathways. Such mobilization formats have been used by Pratham across 26 states in \nIndia and have been positively received by different communities. Given the historically difficult \nissues of human trafficking and livelihood related challenges, the community initially has \ninhibitions on trusting the organization and the program being offered. However, consistent efforts \nfrom the team by conducting different awareness activities eventually built trust among community \nmembers. Videos of the center, alumni members who have completed the course and have now \nbeen placed in a formal job went a long way in providing evidence about the program and its \nbenefits. Community members were invited to visit the center, see the program and interact with the \nstudents to help bring in more transparency. Certificate & offer letter distribution ceremony was \nconducted within community spaces where everyone gathered to felicitate youth who have \ngraduated in vocational courses from those communities. These youth became role models inspiring \nothers to take the vocational education pathway and get access to alternate livelihood opportunities. \nA gradual transition from hesitancy and uncertainty to trust and potentially positive pathway was \nobserved in the perception of community members. \n In addition to meetings and discussions, community engagement was driven through the following \ndifferent formats: \nTool-kit exhibitions: The main intent behind organizing toolkit exhibitions is to take the toolkits of \nvarious programs to the youth far and wide and expose them to the opportunities available in \nvocational skilling. By taking the tools to the heart of the community, the idea is to encourage the \nyouth to interact with the tools and know more about this discipline. The goal behind these \nexhibitions is to forge a connection with the local communities and create a presence. These have \nbeen conducted in high-schools, colleges and market spaces within the communities. Community \nvolunteers were engaged in offering support with exhibition displays and spreading the word about \nthis event. The tools were put on display on different tables in a circular structure along with \ninformation pamphlets and Pratham staff available to explain about the tools and their usage. Such \na display format sparked much curiosity among students and community members to know more \nabout vocational training and livelihood pathways available after training. The team received a \npositive response from all visitors leading to many youth enrolling into the program. 10 tool kit \nexhibitions of Automotive 4W and Hospitality F&B trades were conducted across Nagrakata, \nBanarhat, Madarihat-Birpara, Kalchini, Alipurduar, Kumargram blocks in the past 5 months. \nAround 2142 community members including youth and parents engaged in this activity. \n  \n \nOak Progress Report.    5 \nSummer Reading Camps: Igniting community participation and ownership, the summer reading \ncamp program aimed at involving mothers and youth in building foundational reading and math \ncompetencies in children of std. 1-3. Mothers and youth were trained by Pratham mentors following \nthe ASER testing and Teaching at the Right Level methodology who then conducted these camps \nwith children of the tea-gardens. 853 mothers and youth actively participated in these camps \nhelping 1492 children to learn within their own community space across Banarhat Block (21 TGs), \nMadarihat ( 12 TGs), Falakata Block (4 TGs), Kalchini Block (19 TGs), Alipurduar Blocks (8 \nTGs), Kumargram Block (7 TGs). \nEnglish (Angrezi Okay Please ) Camps: These are activity based camps conducted with youth and \nchildren (Std.6-8) to build foundational English speaking and reading skills. 654 youth and 120 \nchildren registered and participated in this camp across Kumargram Block (3 TG), Nagrakata Block \n(20 TG), Banarhat Block ( 4 TGs).  \nThe Summer Reading Camps and English (Angrezi Okay Please) Camps have been impactful \ninitiatives aimed at enhancing foundational skills in reading, math, and English among children and \nyouth in various tea-garden communities. While these initiatives were not supported by the Oak \ngrant component but by other donors, it's essential to note that they are ongoing activities. This \nsuggests a long-term commitment to education and community development in the area of \nintervention. The sustained nature of these programs indicates our aim to nurturing educational \ngrowth and community involvement in the regions mentioned. The continuation of these initiatives \nreflects goal of creating lasting positive impacts on the learning outcomes and opportunities for \nchildren and youth within these tea-garden communities. \nThe larger intention behind all of the above engagement methods is to form groups of community \nvolunteers and set-up social structures which can help sustain the program in the long-run. All of \nthe above initiatives were received positively by the community fostering a sense of hope for a \nbetter future through alternative livelihood pathways. A clear change in perception is visible with \nrespective livelihood pathways and households are finding merit in encouraging their children to \npursue formal job opportunities within/outside the state. \nPlacement Insights: \nPratham has a robust placement and post-placement support system to help youth have a smooth \ntransition for the formal workforce after completing their training. It has partnered with 7000+ \nindustry organizations across India to offer entry-level jobs to its trainees. The industry demand \ndata is fed into Pratham\u2019s database every month to map potential trainees based on their location \npreference. Pre-placement counseling includes an exclusive session on matching expectations from \nthe industry and challenges that a new workplace and migration may bring forth. Trainees are then \nmapped to their preferred jobs and they are hand-held to prepare for interview and final joining \nformalities. Virtual calls are conducted with Pratham alumni already working in the mapped \nindustry properties to offer a real-time experience of the food, culture and living conditions in that \nlocation. This helps bridge the information gap and build trust among trainees who are about to join \nthe same workplace. It also gives them assurance that they have a group of people to support them \nif needed. Placement associates then accompany trainees to their destination location in case they \nare migrating, others are checked upon through phone calls for any support needed during \njoining.  Post-placement support includes a monthly support call from Pratham team to understand \nyouth\u2019s current employment status, challenges at the workplace and requirement of another \nplacement. The data is collected & maintained in the central M&E system. This helps us gauge \nmovement within industries, job changes and overall retention rates. \nPratham understands that our alumni may need support and guidance even after they complete our \nprograms. To this end, we also have set up a toll-free number (1800-12-000-4007) that is active \nfrom 10 am to 6 pm every day. Our program teams actively circulate these numbers among our \nalumni groups to ensure that our graduates are aware of this valuable resource. Whether our alumni \nneed assistance with job placement or any other kind of support, they can reach out to us on these \n \nOak Progress Report.    6 \nnumbers. We make it a priority to respond to all queries within two days of receiving the call. This \nhelps us provide timely assistance and ensures that our alumni continue to receive the support they \nneed to succeed. Batch-wise WhatsApp groups and an Instagram page dedicated for alumni support \nhas also been created to share information and provide support. The Instagram page hosts reels and \ntestimonials of Pratham alumni\u2019s journey and experiences. \nOur placement coordinators and center teams believe in building a strong community among our \nalumni, and to this end, they organize events on special occasions and festivals. These events are held \neither at our training center or at a location in the city, allowing our alumni to reconnect, catch up, \nand share their experiences with their fellow graduates, trainers, and center teams. These gatherings \nprovide a valuable opportunity to network, make new connections, and stay up-to-date with the latest \ndevelopments in the industry. Our alumni cherish these events and look forward to them each year. \nThe above processes of end-to-end assistance for placement and migration have helped build \nconfidence in trainees to join the workforce eliminating fears of unfamiliarity of a different location \nand culture. Given that they have a support network available at the placement destination reassures \nthem of their safety and provision of help whenever required. The first batch of graduates have \nbecome role models for others inspiring them to drive their own career pathways. Here are some \nquotes from the alumni during placement: \n\"Working as an Assistant Technician at OSL Tata Motors is not just a job; it's a stepping stone to \nmy future. I'm grateful for the training and opportunities Pratham provided.\" says Sanjay from \nGuchimari in Kumargram in Alipurduar. \nSunena Shaw, a 19-year-old from Jalpaiguri District, West Bengal, faced financial struggles in her \nmiddle-class family. She joined Pratham's food and beverage service training to overcome idleness \nand improve her communication skills. Despite language barriers, she completed the training \nsuccessfully. Now, she works at Mount Conifer Suites & Spa, earning 7000/- per month with free \nfood and accommodation, proudly supporting her family. \"I learned a lot at the centre. I was very \nalert and attentive during the training sessions. Now, I can proudly say that I am able to support \nmy family as I always wanted. It's a great feeling.\" \n  \nNeed Assessment Study: A quantitative baseline survey was conducted in 73 villages across \nDarjeeling, Kalimpong, Alipurduar, Coochbehar, and Jalpaiguri districts from 23rd- 27th \nNovember 2022. The overarching goal of the survey was to establish the current scenario in the tea-\ngarden region in terms of the need for skill development & alternate safe employment opportunities \nfor youth. In addition to the community survey, an industry survey was conducted to gauge the \nindustry demand for the skilled workforce in Hospitality and Automotive sectors in North Bengal. \nAdditionally, qualitative interviews were conducted with 27 Households across 3 districts- \nJalpaiguri, Darjeeling and Alipurduar exploring the themes like- Employment types & pathways in \ntea-garden communities, Challenges pertaining to current employment, Perception of the \ncommunity on different employment types- formal jobs, labor, self-employment, gig opportunities, \nPerception/opinion of the community regarding aspiration of employment for the current \ngeneration. \nThe above study brought to the forefront the following insights: \n1.Lack of formal employment opportunities in the region, no industry other than tea-garden \nfactories. Tea-factories offer very few job opportunities , most of which are unskilled, semi-\nskilled labor jobs. \n 2.Youth engage/give into alcohol and drugs being depressed about not getting a job. Lack \nof direction and support is leading youth into delusion and often creating suicidal \ntendencies. Skilling will offer a direction/guidance for youth eventually leading to better \nmental and overall health. \n \nOak Progress Report.    7 \n3.Breaking generations of low-income trap for tea-garden families, formal job opportunities \nwill bring in more income and subsequently improve standards of living. \n 4.Lack of career guidance - Youth have a strong understanding of completing high school \neducation (Class 12th) but lack the necessary guidance to make informed decisions about \nhigher education and career path. This has resulted in a significant gap in knowledge \nregarding the wide array of career opportunities that are available. \n 5.Government jobs seem the most aspired option for college graduates - Many young \npeople who manage to complete their graduation in any field have their sights set on \nsecuring a government job. They spend significant time preparing for such competitive \nexams, often spending years. This trend highlights the enduring appeal of government jobs \nwhich is synonymous with stability and security of job. \n 6.Employment Challenges in Tea Garden - Tea Gardens were once a reliable source of \nemployment for families across generations. However, there are now concerns about change \nin ownership which may bring modification in terms and conditions or even the permanent \nclosure of tea gardens. In this context, it is important to explore alternative employment \nopportunities that can provide a more sustainable livelihood. \n 7.Migration among youth has emerged as a prevalent trend in this area where the younger \ngeneration is willing to take the risk of moving out to different regions across the country in \nsearch of better job opportunities. An increasing number of young people from the area are \nmigrating to other regions and finding employment in the hospitality or O&M (electrical, \nplumbing) sectors. Many of them do not have any prior training or relevant skills and learn \non the job. These opportunities are often obtained through personal networks, with someone \nfrom their area having worked there previously \nThese findings have been helpful in getting a deeper understanding of the tea-garden community \nand developing the program delivery strategy. \nCollaborative Value Creation:  \nPratham\u2019s efforts in North Bengal have been further cultivated due to the  partnerships and \ncollaborations that serve as instrumental pathways to attaining the multifaceted objectives of this \nprogram and amplifying the overarching community impact. Following is the overview of the \ncollaborative efforts with some of the Oak partners, and potential funders: \n1.         Transform Trade: Pratham's collaboration extended to partnering with Prasari, the \nimplementing arm of Transform Trade, which operates in various blocks including Malbazar, \nMeteli, Gorubathan, and Kalimpong. The collaboration encompasses joint mobilization initiatives \nin Gorubathan and Malbazar areas. This partnership has already facilitated mobilization of 20 \nstudents from tea gardens such as Kumai, Jayantike, Abheel, and Hope, spanning Kalimpong, \nDarjeeling, and Jalpaiguri regions. \n2.         Swaniti Initiatives: Pratham's partnership with Swaniti will involve a mutually beneficial \nexchange, where they share posters and training material on social entitlement schemes. This \nsymbiotic collaboration will extend to Pratham providing awareness posters about our programs in \nmultiple languages for Swaniti's usage. \n3.         FPA (Family Planning Association): Focusing on women who have faced abuse, a \ncollaboration will aim to pilot a program that equips them with industry-specific skills, and a \nlivelihood opportunity. \n4.         Nazdeeq: The partnership with Nazdeeq is marked by resource sharing for wider \ncommunity dissemination. Integrating Nazdeeq's legal empowerment content into Pratham's non-\ntechnical sessions will enrich the learning experience. Collaboration extends to facilitating \nconnections with groups for mobilization and enhancing outreach. \n \nOak Progress Report.    8 \n6.         KABIL: The proposal of enrolling youth from KABIL's communities into Pratham's \nprogram will introduce a comprehensive approach to sustainable income generation. \nTo bolster our mobilization efforts further, we have strategically connected with local NGOs \nincluding CASA (Church's Auxiliary for Social Action) mostly working in Alipurduar region and \nDooars Jagron. Additionally, we have also received support from Parimal Mitra Smriti \nMahavidyalaya, a local college, that provides an avenue for expanding efforts to the student \ndemographic. \nEnsuring sustainability, Pratham is proactively seeking funding opportunities from CSR initiatives, \nHNI\u2019s, and other foundations. In Year 1 of the project, we were able to secure funding for the \nproject, amounting to approximately INR 21 lakh, from various HNIs based out of the USA who \nwere interested in supporting Pratham's various activities in skill building and livelihoods. \nMoreover, we have secured another round of funding from a consortium of HNIs (called the \nSwedish Partnership) worth INR 7 lakh for the project which will be used in Year 2 of the \nproject.   These efforts are poised to secure the necessary resources to fortify this intervention and \nwe anticipate more rounds of funding to come in for the project in the coming months. \n  \n \n \n7.c. Challenges and obstacles. \n \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nObjective 1 - Industry-Relevant Skills: Implementing this program in the tea garden region came \nwith unique challenges. The susceptibility to human trafficking created a trust deficit, demanding \ncomprehensive counselling for students and families. Sensitizing them to potential risks and \nsafeguards was essential to ensure their safety and well-being while acquiring industry-relevant \nskills. \nObjective 2 - Employment Linkage: Building trust and credibility was crucial due to past negative \nexperiences with NGOs. Establishing commitment, transparency, and tangible positive impact was \nnecessary to overcome this hurdle. Engaging the community in open dialogue and decision-making \nprocesses played a vital role in rebuilding trust and linking youth to formal job opportunities. \nObjective 3 - Support Network: The lack of a physical presence initially affected enrollment rates, \nas potential participants questioned the program's legitimacy. To provide a support network for \nyouth, Pratham responded by creating awareness through alternative means like toolkit exhibitions \nand community engagement activities. As Pratham's presence became more established, skepticism \naround legitimacy diminished, and the support network for youth in terms of career guidance, \nmigration, and placement support began to take shape. \nIn summary, addressing the challenges in the tea garden region required strategic solutions aligned \nwith Pratham's objectives. Building trust, providing industry-relevant skills, and linking youth to \nemployment opportunities were all part of the journey to empower the community and help youth \ngrow in their professional journeys. \n \n \n8.", "Significant changes": "Significant changes.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nPhysical activities started in the first quarter of 2022 and before that activities were limited to \nonline platforms due to Covid induced global pandemic. However, five physical advocacy \nworkshops have been conducted with each hub partner comprising on an average 40 participants \nfrom the respective partner and community members identified during the process. \nNCAS participated in regular meetings for planning review and coordination with hub partners \nalong with annual review of the project. Each workshop was dedicated to explore the community \nissues and how the community can address it themselves based on strength and weakness. \nVulnerable groups such as farmers, women, children, and migrants were identified along with their \nvulnerabilities such as repairing of river embankment, domestic violence, child marriages, gender \ndiscriminations, drinking water, forced migration due to lack of local opportunities, prevalence of \nanemia in adolescent girls, etc. Sundarban is delta region where river Ganga flows into Bay of \nBengal sea. Islands surrounded by saline sea water are the primary characteristics of local \ngeography. Every year during monsoon or cyclone saline water breaks the weakening river \nembankment and enters into agricultural fields and fish ponds destroying not only current crops but \nthe farm itself. This makes the farm unproductive for the next six or more years subject to intensity \nof salinity. This causes huge loss to the local farmers hence; they want to repair and strengthen the \nriver embankment. Farmers are also struggling to access the fair market price of their farm produce \nsuch as fish, vegetables etc. These issues are interlinked and need to be looked at holistically and \necologically sustainable manner. One group has already started the river embankment repairing \nwork as an alternative model rooted in traditional knowledge and practices by planting local trees \nand shrubs tolerant to saline water.  State agencies are concretizing the river embankment and \nmaking the fluid ecological interface between water and land very hard and impenetrable. As an \nalternative to concretization of river embankment we organized \"Rethinking River Embankment\", a \nfield exposure visit for community members and staffs, so that community members can take local \nand ecologically sustainable initiative in their respective villages to protect their life and livelihood. \nWe conducted NCAS's Resource Person's meet for ideation to pursue in the next phase of the \nproject.   \n \n \n7.c.

Community\u2019s voice must be heard and \nrespected at each level of decision-making process in the community-oriented approach. Hub \npartners struggled to reorient themselves towards the community-oriented approach. Their prior \nexperience was limited to the service delivery, reoriented staff and organizational understanding \ntowards this approach was very challenging and particularly to assimilate it. This also raises many \nquestions, how do we understand community-led processes and how to include the community in \nthe process, given that community is not one unit but many groups subject to gender, caste, class \netc. Ensuring community participation in the process has so many contours to negotiate at the \nvillage level. Asking participants particularly women and girls to stay outside of home for a night to \nparticipate in a workshop was a herculean challenge itself to overcome. Another challenge which \nwill take time to overcome is to help the community to realize that this initiative is not to address \nyour concerns but to empower the community to address their concerns. Political contour at the \nvillage level is most difficult to manage and yet partners are struggling to figure out a strategy to \ndeal with this. Physical accessibility of the villages scattered in islands are very limited. There are \nmany villages which can\u2019t be accessed by roads but through boats. There is also sketchy \ninfrastructure such as electricity and mobile networks in some areas.

Later we \nrealized that segregation of these people in the society, for whatever \npurpose, can create a feeling of being oppressed and left out because \nthe challenges they face every day. As a result we incorporated them \nwith the other groups constituted. like Farmers\u2019 group, Women\u2019s \ngroup, Adolescences' group , Fishermen's group etc. \n[The total disabilities identified so far are: 40 ] (In Achintyanagar-\n22, In Banashyamnagar- 18) \nAction: 2 8 meetings are held to assess the skill level of the disabled people \nand understand the kind of jobs they prefer/ intend/ will be able to do \nand plan capacity building trainings accordingly. \nAction 3: Per Govt. Norms: Disability Certificate is issued- if the disability \nis 60% and above \nFor 8 cases (Achintyanagar: 3; Banashyamnagar: 5)-we find that the \nbeneficiaries are without the Govt. Disability Certificates. \nAs a result these people are unable to access Govt. Sponsored \nSchemes or any Govt. benefits as introduced / provided from time to \ntime for their assistance. \n \nOak Progress Report.    14 \nWe referred such cases to Panchayat for obtaining residential \ncertificates. These, when issued, are carried to the Sub Div. \nHospital at Kakdwip for checking Disability Percentages and \nissuance of certificates   \nImpact:  40 cases of disabilities are reported till date. Of 8 cases that are referred for issuing \nDisability Certificates, 2 are issued as on date. Rest are in process. \n \n \n \n7.9.c. Objective 9 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nChallenges: \na) We face challenges in combing the disable persons under one roof \nb) They are not aware of their rights and ownerships in society \nc) Obtaining disability certificates is a long drawn process.

Objective 1 \nInstitutionalized practices in partner organizations contribute to strengthened systems to prevent and \nprotect Children and Young People at risk of or affected by unsafe migration and assist sustainable \nreintegration of survivors of trafficking and exploitation. \n \n \n7.1.b. Objective 1: Principal accomplishments \nThe project emphasized importance of gender responsive approach to child protection issues and services \nat the system level to reduce stigma against transgender children and survivors of trafficking and sexual \nexploitation. Partners are collectivized to act as a network advocating for the survivors\u2019 right to accessible \nsupport services and creation of local safety nets for prevention of unsafe migration. The project built \ncapacities of CSOs to use tools for a child centred reintegration process and increased acceptance by \ngovernment duty bearers and service providers.  411 frontline workers demonstrated skills on child \nhandling and dealing with difficult behaviour of survivors following child safeguarding principles through \nuse of tools and learnings from project trainings. 165 children reported their views are sought for and \nincorporated into decision making and care planning. Anecdotes from the children indicate how the tool is \nsupporting them to reflect and share their emotions. \n383 government duty bearers shared positive feedback towards the tools and guidelines developed under \nthis project. Decentralised resource pools at district level are established, providing assistance to victims \nof unsafe migration. 45 inter-agency meetings conducted  and 391 cases were supported through this \ncollaboration, which ensured that the voices of the children are heard and the stakeholders in the \necosystem are involved to ensure that Children and Young People (CYPs) recieve quality services. \nSafeguarding Community of Practice has been established with 54 members to promote safety in the \nprocess of reintegration. 379 child care professionals increased knowledge of Child Safeguarding. CSOs \nwere capacitated to support Mental Health, functioning and Psychosocial Wellbeing of survivors of \ntrafficking. 243 frontline workers increased their knowledge on Psychosocial Resilience Framework and \n220 front line workers are now able to monitor Psychosocial Wellbeing of CYPs including survivors by \nusing tools developed by Tdh, UNICEF and a checklist developed by the partners. \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1: Shortfalls \nMultiple challenges were faced during the implementation of the BECOME Tool by the frontline workers. \nThe main challenges and feedback given on the use of the tool was that it is  too time consuming and many \ntimes Children and Youth in Migration (CYiM) with whom the tool is applied loose concentration or are \nunwilling to tell his/her story to be able to complete the process. \nThe partner organisations are working at various stages of the entire spectrum of the anti-trafficking space, \nand come with different levels of capacity and skill sets. For this reason it was challenging to build content \naround trainings that accommodated the needs of all. \nFor conducting the online training sessions with the frontline workers, one of the challenge was consistent \ninternet  connectivity while the level of understanding among all the frontline workers were not found at \nthe same level. \n \n \nThere could have been a more robust and s ystematic follow up on support for the trained social workers \nwithin the partner organisations by Tdh, however   Tdh faced challenges with high staff turnover of the \ntained social workers within the partner organisations. \nInter-agency resource pool formatio n is yet to be done by 6 partner organisations who are comparatively \nsmall and have a lack of funding and inadequate information on district level resources. It was also found \nthat these organizations faced challenges in finding trained personnel who can develop the resource pool. \nIn Year 1 the overall challenge was the impact of COVID-19 second and third wave in the implementation \nand changes in the FCRA Rules which caused a 6 month delay to starting the field level implementation, \nwhich only started from July 2021 onwards. Hence, most of the partners were not able to complete the \ntarget within the 2022 annual plan. \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 \nCommunity level safety nets are established and functional to protect Children and Youth in Migration \n(CYiM) and support reintegration of the victims of unsafe migration/exploitation/ trafficking in 70 Gram \nPanchayats of 12 districts. \n \n \n7.2.b. Objective 2: Principal accomplishments \n103 multi-sectorial coordination meetings and 76 liasons completed with various formal and informal child \nprotection duty bearers at district and block level. Through these, stakeholders in the ecosystem are now \ninvolved to ensure CYP recieve quality, responsive and stigma-free services. 551 formal and informal child \nprotection duty bearers can identify child protection concerns and are aware of their responsibilities and \nreferral pathway. 290 child protection concerns were raised and referred by the formal and informal child \nprotection duty bearers within this reporting period. \n3544 CYiM participated in leadership training, among whom 1850 children were identified by the partner \nto be supported to join local Child Protection Committees (CPCs) 408 children participated in local child \nprotection committee meetings. 231 child prot ection concerns raised and reported by CYP leaders to \nappropriate authorities. For inclusion of the CYiM in the CPCs, 49 advocacy initiatives were completed by \npartner organisations with District Level Child Protection Society for making the CPC\u2019s function al in the \nareas where they are not functional at all or partially functioning and regarding inclusion of CYiM leaders \nin the CPCs and ensuring child participation. \nPartner organisations met with formal and informal district, ward and village level child protection duty \nbearesand organized consultations at the district level for establishment of CPCs. The CYiM prepared and \nplaced a draft during the VLCPC/WLCPC formation meetings to the Panchayat Pradhan as well for \nformation and inclusion of CYP\u2019s in the CPC meetings. 20 CPCs at village and ward level and 1 CPC at \nblock level have been formed in West Bengal and Jharkhand through initiatives taken by the partner \norganisations. The inclusion of the CYP\u2019s in the CPC meetings helped raise the voices of the children on \nthe issues affecting their lives and to advocate for changes. \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2: Shortfalls \n \n \nThe overall challenge was the impact of COVID-19 and changes in the FCRA Rules which led to a 6 month \ndelay in implementing field level activities.   \nDue to the West Bengal State elections,   the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights and other \ninstitutional structures like Child Welfare Committee and the District Child Protection Unit were not \nfunction for a period of time which m ade the advocacy work very challenging. Advocating for the \nmainstreaming of the tools to be incorporated within the Juvenile Justice (JJ) system in Jharkhand was not \npossible, and  collaboration with the State government of Jharkhand is still ongoing for steering the district \nlevel and media advocacies. The project was able to initiate organisational level advocacy and cluster level \nadvocacy work at the district level; however, the planned state level work could not be achieved. \nThe Empowerplus Application and Livelihood Pre-conditioning could not be dessiminated by the partner \norganisations in 2022as the application is under upgradation for additional features based on user feedback. \nAddirionally once of the core consultants working on this passed away from  COVID and retrieving and \ngetting another person to take the work forward caused further delays. \nAs mentioned above in the principal accomplishment of objective 2, the partner organisations have taken \nup various initiatives at district and local level for making the CPC\u2019s functional in West Bengal and \nJharkhand. Despite the initiatives taken, some CPC\u2019s are still not functional in some of the intervention \nareas for which the inclusion of CYiM leaders in the CPCs and ensuring child participation was not 100% \nachieved as targeted.   \n \n \n7.3.a. Objective 3 \nChildren and Young People at risk of or affected by unsafe migration are resilient to challenge harmful \nsocial norms that perpetuate violence and stigma against the survivors of trafficking and exploitation. \n \n \n7.3.b. Objective 3: Principal accomplishments \nCommunity safe spaces were created in 70 locations for fostering discussions and reflection on gender, \nsexuality and norms. The project engaged 2,054 CYP to increase their knowledge on Gender and \nSexuality, risks and support services. 991 CYiM realized appropriate information related to coping with \ninternal reactions, 334 CYiM reported a sense of calm and decreased negative emotions. 1,415 CYiM \nwere able to identify risks they could face, 1,458 CYiM identified the institutions that can respond to their \nsafety concerns and they know how to approach them, 2,941 CYiM demonstrated critical \nthinking/problem solving skills and 264 survivors and CYiM reported increased connectedness with \npeers, family, and kinship network. The above outputs were achieved as a result of 421 trainings on \nGender and Sexuality, 310 trainings on Continuum of Care Approach, Socio Ecological Approachn of \nMHPSS, and 2464 workshops and reflection sessions with girls and 1811 workshops and reflection \nsessions with boys. \nIncreased collective actions were observed at the community level through theatre, sports, arts by girls, \nboys, parents and survivors of trafficking to challenge harmful practices. 227 community based social  \nactions were organised by CYiM on gender based harmful practices and stigma associated with trafficking. \n3,032 influential leaders and communicators participated in social action events, among them 398 \ninfluential leaders and communicators made public declarations against gender based harmful practices and \nhave shown support to survivors. \n669 community male members are able to recognise negative gender norms behind revictimization of \nsurvivors and harmful practices; like forced marriage and 564 male family members showed support to \n \n \ngirls by preventing early marriage and byapproaching survivors and encouraging them to live a stigma \nfree life. \n \n \n7.3.c. Objective 3: Shortfalls \nDevelopment of  Social Behaviour Change guideline based on global guidelines with techniques and tips \nfollowed is ongoing in collaboration with WINDCHANGERS, after the completion of the same, partners \nwill be provided training on how to use the materials. Contextualisation of the stories based on the feedback \nfrom the partners and children has taken longer than anticipated, however we strongly feel that this process \nis critical, and therefore have not taken shortcuts to speed the process up. \nThe understanding on gender and sexuality is varied among the project partner organisations, where a was \nobserved among the frontline workers when they initiated discussions on gender and sexuality. For many, \nthey felt comfortable to talk about sexuality, menstrual health, safe and unsafe touch. \nIn conducting reflection sessions with boys, the partner organisations shared a challenge relating to the drop \nout. This drop out rates of boys are much higher among the boys in the age group 15 -18 years and above \nupto 24 years since the boys are mostly migrating out from the villages with their  families for seasonal \nworks. \nIn conducting reflection sessions with the girls also related to drop out, Girls who are in the age group 18- \n24 years are getting married or migrating with families for work, or going out for educational purpose since \nthere is no proper infrastructure for higher studies in most of the intervention areas. \nOne of the challenge faced by the partners at field level is getting in touch with the male members and \nbringing all the male members in one place to initiate discussions. The male members are the main \nbreadwinners of the family and most of them migrate out of the village in search of work and are therefor \nunavailable. \n \n \n \n8.", "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project?": "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project? \nRecommendations that came out of the endline (phase 2 of the Oak grant) and baseline study for this \ncurrent phase 3", "Grant period": "grant period: \nThe baseline study carried out during the initial phase of Year-1, OAK Phase 3 was helpful to understand \nthe current status of implementation. Some of the major findings were: \n\u2022 Need for strengthening of inter-agency resource pools at the district level for addressing immediate \nneeds of the survivors like food, nutrition, health and livelihood support. \n\u2022 Providing handholding support to the partner organisations since the understanding. \n\u2022 District level child protection institutions and service providers have not been adequately engaged \nwith to influence institutional processes and practices through tools, the need of training on psycho-\nsocial support, safeguarding, gender and harmful social norms, and their for have been identified \nto be incorporated in the new/current 3rd grant phase. \n\u2022 The advocacy initiatives towards sustainable reintegration must have a focus on ensu ring market \noriented livelihood options to women towards empowering them as well as augmenting their family \nincome, \n\u2022 Prevention of trafficking to be advocated at all levels of the government, \n \n \n\u2022 Engaging with relevant agencies of the state to adequately addres s the rehabilitation and \nreintegration needs of survivors, \n\u2022 Devise suitable ways of leveraging the learnings to inspire similar initiatives in the sector, as well \nas create models to demonstrate the results by strengthening organizations with certain strengths to \nsupport strategic growth, \n\u2022 Deconstruct non-negotiable features of a \u2018functional\u2019 community level safety net with a focus on \nsustainability, \n\u2022 Ensuring more participation of men seems crucial as typically men are the decision makers within \nfamily, \n\u2022 The need of registration system at panchayat level for tracking and monitoring of influencing gram \npanchayats to prioritize vulnerable families under the list of potential beneficiaries of different \nwelfare and poverty reduction programmes, \n\u2022 C suitable pedagogy to conduct discussions on the issues of gender and sexuality as well as \nengaging with community beliefs towards addressing stereotypes, \n\u2022 Ensuring space for survivors to engage in dialogue, create online training programmes; particularly \nfor service providers associated with district level child protection institutions, \n\u2022 Strengthen inter -agency collaboration in order to envisage new avenues of skill building and \nlivelihood opportunities for women, beyond gender stereotypes and primary sector, \n\u2022 Sensitization of district level child protection functionaries on standard child reintegration \npractices, \n\u2022 Currently, child safeguarding/ protection policy of most organizations doesn\u2019t seem to suggest \nsuitable ways to \u2018respond\u2019 to the harms that have happened beyond reporting or identify measures \nto address the immediate needs of the victim, and pandemic induced vulnerabilities needs to be \ntaken into account \n  \nIncorporating M&E as a critical domain within the project based on the recommendation from the \nbaseline.which we believe will add significant value to the project. An online workshop was organized for \nall the partner organisations, which was conducted by the M&E officer of Tdh Foundation where \ndiscussions were carried outon the project follow up tools, which the partne rs are using for reflecting the \nplan and result of implementation on a monthly basis. The workshop has been very beneficial for the partner \norganisations to develop an understanding on how to establish links between the activities planned and the \nresults being achieved with the CYiM, and how to maintain the supporting documents. A resource document \nwas prepared for the partners to follow, which was shared with them for streamlining the process of updating \nof project follow up tool. \nBased on the above mentio ned recommendations of the baseline study,  within this reporting period \n5 decentralised resource pools  were formed in Jharkhand and 3 in West  Bengal to provide assistance to \nvictims of unsafe migration   at the district level for addressing immediate needs of the survivors such as \nfood, nutrition, health and livelihood support. \nThe Formation of a project steering \u201cCore Group\u201d has been an important milestone for the Project. Given \nthe large network of partner NGOs in the Project, the Core Group comprised of 6 NGOs in Jharkhand and \n7 NGOs in West Bengal along with Tdh, to ensure the smooth functioning of the Project towards its \nsuccessful conclusion. The Core Group  has been supporting Tdh to provide strategic direction of the \nproject, determine a plan of actions for certain initiatives. The Core Group has been formed with suggestions \nfrom all the partner organizations and has a specific Terms of Reference. The membership in the core group \nis revolving, with a new group formed every year to allow new organisatio ns to join the group. The core \ncommittee members have added values during the review meetings and have worked on development of \n \n \nsafeguarding and MHPSS checklist which will be commonly followed by all the organisations in measuring \nthe changes at the ground level. \nAll organisations are not of equal strengths and capacity and some of them find difficulties in \ninstitutionalizing the learnings from the different trainings and workshops in their regular activities. Case \nmanagement has been found to be a challeng e with several social workers expressing the need for more \nhand holding support. On-site technical support can be provided to social workers to enable them to develop \nskills for more effective case management. Hence several capacity building workshops were organized for \nthe frontline workers in this reporting period. \nAs a result, 14 organisations were identified (7 from West Bengal and 7 from Jharkhand) among the 30 \npartner organisations as piloting partners (partners who will pilot the negative gender norm  change \nintervention to reduce stigma and violence against the survivors which falls under outcome 3). The selection \nof these 14 piloting  partners was based on capacities of the organisations and was done in a consultative \nand transparent way. The remainin g partner organisations are identified as the non -piloting partner \norganisations and are working only under outcome 1 and 2.   \n  \nThe delays and restrictions as a result of COVID-19 helped the team to learn how to be agile by changing \noperational practices, ways of communication and work. In adapting to the changing context and ways of \nworking, the project team digitalised the trainings and learningsto provide blended victim support services. \nDuring the monitoring visits, from the field anecdotes were collec ted from the CYP and Stakeholders to \ndocument changes taking place as a result of the intervention. Some of the anecdotes are mentioned below- \n\u201cI am Ayesha, I am a youth leader of Sabuj Sathi group. I have received many training as a youth leader. I \nhave received mental support, educational support like books, tuition fees etc. from GGBK. In this year, I \nhave passed my secondary examination. I am very happy to be a part of this youth leadership programme.\u201d \n\u201cWe children of Baridih, Bero Block,Ranchi found this process of Kabaddi very helpful during this period \nof lockdown. We never had such opportunity to think about our mental wellbeing through games and \nother activities.\u201d \n\u201c During this lockdown we were closed at home and we were totally cut off from the peer groups but this \nprocess gives us opportunity to sit together and discuss on the child protection issues.\u201d \n\u201cWe learnt how to sit together and help each other and express our views after this important intervention \nin our village and learnt about gender  and other child protection concerns and how the harmful social \nnorms are so deeply rooted within our thought process.\u201d \n\u201cThere is a playground in my village in which only boys used to play. There was no place for girls to play \nwith other girls. Once the boy and the girl were given training on gender and leadership by the NGO didi , \nit could change the mindset and awareness of both the boys and the girls.As a result both the teams have \nagreed  to play on the same field. Now both boys & girls are enjoying Kab addi / Badminton or football \ngame together along with their peers in the same field.\u201d \n\u201cThrough mapping process of YouCreate I have explored the resources of my village and also identified \nproblems which has helped me to understand a picture of my area where I stay. I am a Children and Youth \nin Migration (CYiM) leader, I have learnt leadership and I know how to manage problems of my own life \nand my peer group members.\u201d-Statements from the CYP\u2019 s \n\u201cI am a local language teacher in a government school. I am fami liar with the school's teaching and \nlearning rules, but child protection was a new word for me. I didn\u2019t had adequate information about what \nis trafficking, child safeguarding, child marriage and CHILDLINE, although the child rights had been \nheard. There have been a series of meetings and trainings for  Children and Youth in Migration (CYiM) \nconducted at the school, in which I have also had the opportunity to attend many times. This made us \nknowledgeable. In view of their needs, especially for the safe place of the girl child, a room has been allotted \nto Children and Youth in Migration (CYiM) group in the school where they perform meetings and other \nactivities as a group.\u201d \n \n \n\u201cFrom the COVID pandemic period, I have seen that children have stopped studying and co ntinuously \nplaying or going to forest for collecting woods as  a source of income. So, after the schools have started \nafter lockdown, only 50% children have started going to school. Now, I along with the village level \nvolunteers have started tracking the children who are out of school to bring them back and readmitted them \nin school. Because according to me, if children can be bought back to the mainstream of education then all \nproblems of child marriage, child trafficking and child labour will be less in numbers, as children will find \nan objective in their life to go ahead in future.\u201d \n-Statements from the stakeholders and influential leaders \n\u201cI never used to take part in household work but now I help my wife. I also used to discriminate between \nmale and female children, but my outlook has been changed.\u201d \n\u201cI have understood the issues of Toxic Masculinity and have changed myself after attending the \nmeetings.\u201d \n\u201cNow I protest whenever I observe any violence against women and I also invite other to protest. \u201c \n\u201cNow I can understand and identify the gender discrimination's existing in our society, and trying to \nchange myself.\u201d \n-Statements from the male members \n \n \n9.", "How will your team use this information to change the way you work?": "How will your team use this information to change the way you work? \nBased on the learnings of Year 1 of OAK Phase-3, in Year 2 the plan is as followed: \n1. Partner organisations have been provided with handholding support on BECOME Tool, MHPSS, \nGender and Sexuality, Safeguarding etc. since the understanding of the tools and other relevant \ntopics under this intervention required more support. \n2. 1 state level consultation in West Bengal, 103 multi-sectorial coordination meetings and 76 liasons \nhave been done with various formal and informal child protection duty bearers to make the \ncommunity level safety net functional with a focus on sustainability, advocating on prevention of \ntrafficking at all levels of government and engaging with relevant agencies of the state to address \nthe rehabilitation and reintegration needs of the survivors. \n3. Considering the power dynamics, participation of men seems crucial as typically men are the \ndecision makers within the family, hence in Year 1, 669 male members can recognise negative \ngender norms behind revictimization of survivors and harmful practices; like forced marriage and \n564 male family members show support to girls by preventing early marriage and to survivors by \nencouraging them to live a stigma free life. \n4. Through development of the module on gender and sexuality, training sessions were organized with \nthe frontline wo rkers on Gender and Sexuality, and the project engaged  with 3032 influential \nleaders and communicators in various social events to conduct discussions on the issues of gender \nand sexuality as well as engaging with community beliefs towards addressing stereotypes. \n5. Community safe spaces have been created in all the 70 locations to ensure safe spaces for the CYP \nto engage in dialogue. \n6. Online training programmes are created on Child Protection, Gender and Sexuality, MHPSS, \nSafeguarding for the service providers associated with district level child protection institutions. \n7. The inter-agency collaborations were strengthened to envisage new avenues of skill building and \nlivelihood opportunities for women through linkage with varios government schemes, scholarships \nand vocational trainings. \n \n \n8. Training has been provided to the organisation level and field level focal points on the 5 modules \nof safeguarding  to ensure that the organizations ensure suitable ways to \u2018respond\u2019 to the harms that \nhave happened beyond reporting or identify measures to address the immediate needs of the victim. \n9. Pandemic induced victims were taken into considerations where the children who have lost one or \nboth parents during the pandemic were linked with various schemes of the gover nment like \nsponsorship scheme, and the education system through admission in Kasturba Gandi Vidyalayas, \nand dry ration support through linkage with CHILDLINE etc. \nThrough the   following initiatives based on the feedback received from children during the ba seline \nevaluatuion, the voices of the children raised have been considered at all levels of intervention. \nIn Year 2, the aim is to achieve results that could not be achieved in Year 1, and to respond to the \nrecommendations from the evaluation, such as implementation of the child protection policy of Ministry of \nWomen and Child development in every school in the intervention areas, leveraging learnings to inspire \nsimilar initiatives in the sector, create models to demonstrate results by strengthening organiz ations with \ncertain strengths in the strategic direction, leveraging organization\u2019s capacity on psychosocial interventions, \nregistration system at Panchayat level for tracking and monitoring, Influencing Gram Panchayats to \nprioritize vulnerable families un der the list of potential beneficiaries of different welfare and poverty \nreduction programmes and engaging with relevant agencies of the state to adequately address the \nrehabilitation and reintegration needs of survivors. Based on this, the following actibivities for the 2nd year \nare planned: \n1. Capacity building support to  grass root level workers who are continuously engaging in all the \nactivities at field level. The capacity building workshops have been planned to be done primarily \non Gender and Sexuality and MHPSS through face to face discussions and activity oriented sessions \nwhich the frontline workers can use during field level implementation. \n2. Based on feedbacks received from the frontline workers during the review meetings and partners \nmeet, handholding support in Empowerplus upgraded version and the Livelihood Preconditioning \nTool will be provided.   \n3. Training of Trainers (TOT) on Problem Management Plus (PM+) a WHO transdiagnostic \npsychological intervention for common mental health problems for the fro nt line workers for \npsychological intervention program, that can be delivered by non-specialist counsellors. \n4. The Core Committee Group which has been formed in West Bengal and Jharkhand will be \nrestructured again since the group is of revolving nature to fo ster the principles of partnership, \nparticipation and collaboration in the project more effectively. \n5. The Technical Advisory Group (TAG) will be revived in West Bengal and Jharkhand in Year-2 The \nmembers of the TAG will support in providing technical inputs for revising the tools, align the tools \ndeveloped with Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015 and will provide support in \nstrategic advocacy with government. \n6. E-learning materials will be developed on the 5 basic child protection laws of India in  local \nlanguages (Hindi and Bengali) which will promote understanding among the frontline workers on \nthe legal framework. \n7. The plan in Year 2 is to conduct a series of state and district level consultations in West Bengal and \nJharkhand on Gender Responsive Prevention and Response to Child Protection with Child \nProtection Duty Bearers and with Media on Ethical Reporting to focus more on the engagements \nwith government bodies and media and boost up the advocacy initiatives. \n8. Tdh staffs will be more available to the partners (specially Jharkhand) to support Gender and Norm \nintervention, MHPSS Intervention through sports and art methodologies due to the low  level of \nunderstanding among partners. \n9. Tdh will create more space for knowledge and information sharing among the partners as exchange \nof ideas, actions and good practices play an important role in design and plan for advocacy.  \n \n \nLongitudinal study will be conducted to understand \u201cdiffusion in social norms change around gender \namong adolescent and young people and its outcome on stigma against the survivors of exploitation, their \nsocial cohesion and psychosocial resilience. The objective of the longitudinal study is to understand how \nstructured CYiM led social behaviour change communication interventions contribute to organised \ndiffusion in social norms change and supporting social cohesion, psychosocial resilience and then \neffectively reduced stigma against survivors of exploitation. This study will further help us to understand \nthe conditions that help or hinder changes in gender norms. \n \n \n10.", "How will you share what you have learned inside and outside your organisation?": "How will you share what you have learned inside and outside your organisation? \nThe learning that is being generated within the Project have been disseminated in various ways. \n\u2022 Tdh\u2019s Social Media Platform: Good practices and learnings are shared through Tdh\u2019s Facebook, \nInstagram and LinkdIn page with readers, like minded organisations, academics, mental health \npractitioners and members. \n\u2022 Partners meet: Project updates, good practices and experiences are shared thr ough the partners \nmeet.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nProgress Report for the period of 1/07/2021 to 31/10/22 \n  \n  \nDuring Second wave of Covid-19, we started working in the field to form community groups. As \nmany issues were discussed during Micro level planning, the groups started forming based on \nvarious issues associated with different communities like farmers groups for agriculture related \nissues, women groups for livelihood related issues, adolescent groups for child marriage or \nmigration related issues. Through general issue discussion and introducing the objective of this \nproject, several women and adolescents girls related issues like negligence to menstruation health, \nearly child marriage, school drop out, early pregnancy, random child birth at home, gender based \nviolence(especially domestic violence)  etc. Considering these issues a few mixed adult women and \nadolescent groups were formed and Mukti field ACV staff started organizing several workshops on \ngender discriminations with the help of various participatory tools supported by Rupantaran and \nPrajaak. 8 Adolescent girls boys and 5 women groups( total 320 groups members) got support to \nbuild their perspective on gender related issues and gradually started identifying gender \ndiscrimination in their personal life. The basic sensitization workshops also conducted among adult \nmen groups. As a result, women started taking active role in the collective discussions making \nprocess and the woman man ratio in every meetings are nearly became 1:1 as other men are also \nstarted taking positive initiative to create a safe and non judging space for women. Adolescent \ngroups have also started identifying their issues and through root cause analysis, they are getting \na clear understanding on gender discrimination and how it impacts their lives( issues came during \ndiscussion like - restriction in higher education for girls, mobility restrictions, gender role etc)  \nAs an outcome, Heramba Gopalpur women group joined in a community led event organized on \n15th Aug 2022. For Heramba Gopalpur women group, it was the first time for them when they \nparticipated in a rally and slogan writing. In the main part of the program they also gave a speech \non Independence day.  \n \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \n  \nDuring the community groups formation, we initially faced a huge political challenges as most of \nthe group members were belong to  different vulnerable groups, the ruling party members started \ngiving objections to conduct any meetings regarding their issues. For these political pressure, a \nlarge number of members started dropping out from the groups and refuse to take part into any \ndiscussions. At that time, the whole ACV working team started approaching to the panchayat \nmembers to join the meetings to understand the objective of this project. But due to the presence of \nthe Panchayat members, some kind of pseudo domination in each discussion started taking places \nand these discussions spaces turned into a space for ruling and opponent party members and the \nreal issues left undiscussed. In such situations a few perspective building workshops conducted by \nthe facilitation of  ACV team among all the groups to develop the capacity of the community \nmembers as well as the Panchayat members to understand the concept of right based and \ncommunity led approach and to develop the relationship between community members , ACV team \nmembers and Panchayat or other powerful stakeholders( teachers, doctors, health workers). With \nseveral set of meeting and discussion or activities ( perspective building support and \nmodule provided  by Praxis, Rupantaran, DRCSC, NCAS and Prajaak) , the groups became stable \nand the power influence tends to decrease over time.    \nIn the beginning of 2nd year ( 1/07/2021),  new field staff and program coordinator were recruited \nwho were not completely aligned with the project goal. Hence, it became a bit challenging to the \nACV staff to be the facilitators and as a result, most of the proposed solutions started \nbecome partially influenced by the project staff itself such as the decisions taken by collective \ndiscussion on training topics, scheduling the meetings, issue identification etc. This challenge \ngradually solved with the continue handholding support of other ACV resource partners and \ninternal staff meeting and orientation program.            \n           \n \n \n \n7.2.a.

The issues mostly addressed by the women groups are - 1. \nLimited scope for sharing personal opinion in the group meetings,2.Lack of confidence to talk \nabout the violation of their basic rights(mobility, earning options, decision making, domestic \nviolence, health related issues). The sensitization program performed by Mukti ACV field staff \nhelped those women to understand the reason of these issues through but it takes a lot more time to \ndevelop their confidence to talk about those issues freely in front of other community members. In \norder to achieve the safe environment for all the women members from different \ncommunities(Farmers, daily labour, Migrant workers etc) many orientation program conducted and \nas a result, women started taking initiatives to raise voice against discrimination. Initiative taken \nby the Women collective - 1. Rally to raise awareness on gender based discrimination, slogan \nwriting 2. Motivational speech on woman's empowerment by women members, 3. Awareness \nprogram on Menstruation Health, 4. Developing business and marketing idea for sanitary pad \nproduction 5. Started taking action on community led advocacy to avail free ambulance \nservice(which was provided earlier and recently has been stopped by the local Govt) for the \npregnant women.  \nInitiative taken by the Adolescents groups -  1.Both boys and girls equally participated in rally to \nraise awareness on  menstruation health related taboo and developing a street play group to raise \nawareness on early child marriage and Child labour (Adolescent boys are forced to start working to \nsupport their family from early ages and this situation increases the possibility of unsafe migration) \n. 2. Active role has been taken by the adolescent groups in community led advocacy on river \nembankment related issues to collect the required evidence.3. Adolescent groups are also \nplanning to take initiative to reduce the negative impact of unnecessary usage of social media and \nextreme addiction of online gaming in the youth community.       \n \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n \nOak Progress Report.    5 \n  \n  \nInitially we faced several challenge to mobilize the women and develop their confidence to take any \ninitiative to raise voice against the violation of their rights and various gender based \ndiscriminations. During the 15th Aug program planning, all the woman's collective(5groups - 120 \nwomen) refused to participate actively in awareness program as they were concerned about the \ncomments they might have received for stepping out from their home to participate in  such \ncommunity events and as a result they ended up suggesting the Adolescent groups(8 groups - 100 \nboys and 120 girls) to attend this event to fulfill the purpose. To overcome such challenges, we \nrequested these women groups to arrange a few meetings to talk about this issue. To resolve \nthis,  Mukti ACV team facilitated the risk assessment process and orientation programs to develop a \nclear perspective about the consequences of their initiative and who and how the others will be \nimpacted through these. With several approach, a few women from each groups convinced to take \nlead to mobilize other women and they successfully completed the event.  \nIn community led advocacy group which is working on river embankment issue, several challenges \nwere experienced by the vulnerable community representatives during the larger village level \ncommittee formation. As river embankment issue is one of the major issues in Heramba gopalpur \narea which is untreated by local Govt for past few years, people from most effected \ncommunities refused to talk about their issues to find a possible solution through collective \ndiscussion as they were more concern about their approach might get wrong and they will become \nmore vulnerable. Hence a conflict created in this village level committee and they started deforming \nit. To resolve such issues, the objective of community led advocacy again properly defined among \nthese committee members by the ACV facilitators and by the support of NCAS member, the \ncommittee started becoming united     \n \n \n \n7.3.a.

Objective 3 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \n \nOak Progress Report.    6 \n  \n  \nThe communities which are relatively vulnerable based on their livelihood have been included \nin this initiative. The process started with several focus group discussion to understand the  current \nlivelihood status of several communities  and the challenges they are facing right now. \nThrough  multiple meetings,  women groups turned into the most vulnerable groups as they all are \ndirectly or indirectly involve in several livelihoods(especially farming, fishing) but don't have \nminimum agency over the earnings and the second most vulnerable community in Heramba \nGopalpur area is the farmers community. Earning through farming became one of the unstable \noptions as in past 4 years, people of Heramba Gopalpur experienced four disasters(Amphan, \nPhaani, Bulbul and Yaash) which created flooding situations in their area. This situation mostly \nforced the farmers community (specially male farmers with limited land) to become \nseasonal migrant workers to run their families. On other hand, the degree of vulnerability of this \nfarmers community is also high due to the lack of knowledge about cropping as most of the lands \nare only used for monocropping so the net worth of annual produce become low as respect to the \nneed of a farmer's family. This situation also leads most of the farmers to become a migrant \nworkers for most of the period of time in a year. In such situation, to revive the soil condition, \norganic farming training has been provided to almost 300 farmers where around 30% farmers \n(including women and men) started making organic fertilizer and pesticides to reduce farming \nexpenses.   \nAnd among the women and mixed groups, these groups started exploring suitable options according \nto their resource and abilities. Through several participatory approach, few livelihood options came \nup from these groups such as chicken rearing (especially native breed) indigenous seed collection \nand selling, crab culture , sanitary pad production, paper plate making, scented stick and candle \nmaking etc. Along with skill development training, several orientation program and marketing skill \ndevelopment process also going on among these groups. The training needs came up through local \ndemand and supply chain analysis. Presently farmers groups(Women and men) and other interested \nmembers from different communities received chicken rearing training and started chicken farming \nin a small scale.    \n \n \n \n7.3.c. Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n \nOak Progress Report.    7 \n  \nThe concept of having an additional livelihood option in their own locality is largely ignored in \nvarious communities in Sundarbans. As farming is the primary livelihood for ~85% of population \nin Heramba Gopalpur GP and most of the lands are used for mono cropping, for the additional \nincome purpose, most of the people (especially male members of the family) became engage in \nseasonal fishing or became migrant worker for a long period of time in the year. These issues were \nobserved during the FGD with the farmers, fisherman and daily labour groups. Through meetings \nand  discussion, as different additional livelihood options were introduced to these groups, mostly \nmale members were refused to take interest for further discussion or initiatives. In such situation, \nthe additional livelihood implementation initiative started with the women groups who are involved \nwith different livelihood ( farming, daily labour, fishing). Through new FGH(Focus Group \nDiscussion) , several needs emerged but also a clear demand came from the communities regarding \nfinancial and marketing support for any production related business ideas such as Pickle, Scented \nSticks, Soft toys etc. Then the ACV team started taking different approach to build capacity of the \ncommunities to understand the local market demands and supply chain for developing own ideas \naccording to the needs of the local market. To develop such capacity, several tools were given to \nhelp them understand the current market demands. Parallelly, a few orientation programs were \nconducted to help them understand their role to sustain their livelihood.  These all initiatives are \ngradually helping to eliminate the concept of dependency to third parties for raw material \ncollection, product manufacturing and marketing.   \nPresently , the woman groups mapped and analyzed the basic local market demands and according \nto that, they have selected two livelihood options - 1. Sanitary pad manufacturing and marketing 2. \nChicken rearing(native breed). Hence to establish their business, the woman groups are making \nstrategies to overcome these challenges.  \n \n \n8.", "Significant changes": "Significant changes. If applicable and not addressed in the challenges and obstacles question for a particular \nobjective, please state any changes that occurred over the last grant period affecting grant terms and goal delivery (i.e., key \nstaffing, leadership, timeline or organisational structural changes).   \n* Please note that financial-oriented updates (i.e., actual funding received, funding spend-down changes) should be \ncommented on within the Oak Budget to Actuals Report. \n \nOak Progress Report.    8 \nSignificant Changes  \n  \n1.Through out this period, several orientation training and sensitization workshops were conducted \namong several community members based on their caste, religion, sex, age, livelihood, \nsocial position etc. Initially during the meeting period, only a few members were actively \nparticipated in these meeting and the others people remained silent for most of the times and as our \nfacilitators  were also not capacitated enough to manage such situation, the space that they were \ntrying to create for all members remained limited to few community members  who are in a better \nsocial position. This scenario started changing gradually when we(the facilitators) become more \nequipped through participating in several capacity building workshops and we started \nunderstanding our role even better to ensure maximum active participation of all members in each \ngroup. This practice helped us create a safe space for women and adolescents. As a clear indication, \na woman from the minority community shared her experience for being humiliated by all the \nneighbors including the panchayat members  due to her daughter refused to accept her abusive \nhusband and chose to marry for second time. During the meeting, she shared this incident in front \nof all other group members and especially to the panchayat member who was present in \nthis meeting to explain how this discriminatory behavior impacted their lives. \n2. Through Participatory Action Research process, the community groups started taking initiatives \nin order to identify issues , analyse the issues, evidence collection, stakeholders mapping and \nstrategy planning through adopting various  participatory approach. Through PAR, most \nof initiatives gradually turn into community-led with the minimal support of ACV facilitators.  \n3. The ACV Mukti project staff became more sensitive in respect to various sense. Before receiving \nany capacity building training, the facilitators were completely unaware of participatory approach. \nHence in the initial meetings, the facilitators dominated the entire meeting. But over the period of \ntime, as we were introduced to participatory approach through training and workshop, our approach \nto community members changed completely. From selecting the meeting dates, making the meeting \nagenda, any activity related planning to implementation - all are being conducted through \nparticipatory approach facilitated by the ACV field staff.                 \n \n \n9.

Presently, the collectives are going through \na cycle of perspective and skill enhancing and action. The adolescent collectives took actions \non the issues identified & prioritised by them which includes survey on gender-based work \ndivision & menstruation, theater on early marriage & menstruation, rally by the young people \nto build public opinion on anti-trafficking issues. Women collectives have been developing \nthe action plans, strategies and will act upon it in next grant cycle. \n\u2022 Another key strategy to ACV is strengthening the leadership of vulnerable groups. We \ndeveloped a participatory process which was democratic as well as have reflection of values \nof leadership. Around 50 leaders from the vulnerable community have been identified through \nthis process by the collectives. The skill of the leaders is being enhanced to develop leadership \nabilities so that they can be effective leaders. They are now planning and taking actions of \nissues affecting them. \n\u2022 In Gopalnagar GP, the VLCPC a community-based committee under the ICPS was existing, \nbut in a dormant stage. Even few committee members were not aware of existence of such \ncommittee or they are part of such committee. A series of advocacy was conducted with \npanchayat authorities and block officials to activate all the 12 VLCPCs in Gopalnagar Hub \nby reforming the group and to include the adolescent collective members as child \nrepresentative of the VLCPC. After reformation of VLCPCs along with local panchayat, we \nprovided capacity building training of VLCPCs.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nIn Year 1, we reflected and examined our previous approach, and re-strategized to make necessary \nmodifications in line with the project\u2019s vision. We pivoted our communication strategy to focus on \nthe deeper aspects of SRH, modified our outreach methodology to incorporate behavior change \nprinciples, and focused on better understanding the attitudinal barriers of health staff that hamper \nservice provision. While on one hand, these changes represent a significant strategic shift aligning \nwith the project's intent, they also provided immense organizational learning. As we began \nimplementing this revised approach, we saw better engagement with the community and our \nimproved ability to elicit more meaningful responses from our audience that will be helpful in \ndriving the desired behavior change. \nSummary of progress on project outcomes: \n1. Trained 12 youth leaders on new communication strategy \n\u2022 Re-designed our communication strategy to focus on rights, barriers and gender using a \nbehavioral change approach (details in 7.1.c). \n\u2022 Conducted four-day residential training followed by three-day practice for youth leaders and \ntheir supervisor. \n\u2022 Youth leaders initiated community outreach using participatory interactions to make young \npeople more active participants in their own behavior change. \n2. Oriented 9,410 young women and 7,640 young men on life skills, rights, and gender \nYoung women \n\u2022 Engaged with young women with focus on SRH rights, barriers faced in exercising these \nrights and their aspirations for change. \n\u2022 The sessions sparked interest among young women and led to provoking questions \u2013 on \ncurbs on movement or clothing choices unlike male counterparts, on restrictions during \nmenstruation, and around other practices that make them uncomfortable. The discussions set \nthe foundation for subsequent rounds that will build their skills to communicate these issues \nwith adults and partners. \n\u2022 Promoted our AI-powered chatbot (Disha Didi) and conducted SRH sessions in schools \nreaching 1,800 girls. \nYoung men \n\u2022 Conducted sessions with men on relevant SRH information, particularly contraception, and \nemphasized their role in supporting women's SRH. \n\u2022 Used an interactive game to emphasize the connection between reproductive health and \nfinances. This encouraged discussions on the importance of family planning giving segway \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \nto deeper discussions \u2013 including adopting safe sexual practices and using contraception \nthemselves for the benefits it brings to their relationships and families. \nAlso conducted couple counselling with non-users of contraceptive \u2013 youth leaders reported \nthat 2,100 of 2,700 couples have adopted a modern contraceptive (self-reported), with nearly \n55% using condom. \n3. Sensitized 1,840 family members on supporting young women\u2019s SRH \nSensitized mothers and mothers-in-law on SRH-related barriers that came up during discussions \nwith young women. While a lot of these emanated from long-held beliefs and traditionally \nfollowed practices, they also include common misconceptions that hinder adoption of healthy \nSRH practices by young women \u2013 youth leaders addressed these during their sessions. \n4. Strengthened two public health facilities to offer youth friendly SRH services \nOriented all relevant staff in intervention facilities (four CAC providers and two counsellors) on \nprovisions of the MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021 and provision of youth-responsive SRH \nservices, including abortions to young women. \n5. Strengthened six HWCs to offer SRH services and referral \n\u2022 Based on district officials\u2019 request, conducted district-level contraceptive training for 10 \ncommunity health officers (CHOs) to expand their role in contraceptive service provision \u2013 \nthe training was attended by the civil surgeon and other officials, who appreciated the \ntraining. \n\u2022 Conducted virtual orientation for 20 CHOs and a telemedicine hub doctor for initiating \nprovision of injectable contraceptive through eSanjeevani (federal government\u2019s \ntelemedicine program). \n\u2022 Conducted facility strengthening, including provision of equipment, facilitating IEC \nmaterials, strengthening documentation, and introduction to the referral mechanism. \n\u2022 Strengthened six sub centres in the catchment area as referral points \u2013 we oriented relevant \nstaff on SRH and referral mechanism and facilitated display of IEC material. \n      Our complementary efforts at the community and facility levels facilitated provision of SRH \nservices to 14,375 young women.

Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nKey learnings and insights: \n\u2022 Communication strategy \u2013 Developed in collaboration with a social and behavior change \ncommunication consultant, the revised communication strategy emphasizes on key \nprinciples \u2013 rights, power, space, participation and inclusion \u2013 and works to address key \nfactors that influence behavior, including social norms, beliefs and values. The youth \nleaders are on a learning curve implementing these newer concepts in the community, and \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \nwe are continuously adapting and refining the strategy (including combining modules) \nbased on their experience and learnings. \n\u2022 Working with the SRH framework \u2013 The revised strategy meant a major shift in the \ncommunity engagement approach of youth leaders, with focus on understanding the target \naudience's attitudes, beliefs, and motivators, and working on changing SRH-related \nbehaviors keeping these in mind. This approach brought forth unanticipated responses from \nthe communities, including seeking solutions for structural barriers (such as movement \nrestrictions) and other allied issues (like child marriage). This in turn has meant more \nintense mentorship by IDF to equip youth leaders to manage such conversations. Keeping \nthis in view, we have planned periodic capacity building of youth leaders to enable them to \neffectively moderate such conversations and offer support/referrals. \n\u2022 Prevailing attitudinal barriers among providers \u2013 We introduced a tool \u2013 an adaptation of \nIpas\u2019s Stigmatizing Attitudes, Beliefs and Actions Scale (SABAS) \u2013 to measure health \nstaffs\u2019 attitudes, perceptions and stigma related to abortion and contraception. The tool \ncomprises of 25 statements that the respondent rates on a Likert scale which is used to \nmeasure three important dimensions, negative stereotyping, exclusion and discrimination, \nand fear of contagion from those who associate with abortion and contraception. The tool \nhelped us discover prevailing negative beliefs and attitudes that hinder service provision \u2013 \nsuch as women who use birth spacing may become promiscuous or having an abortion may \nbecome a habit for women \u2013 that we will work on addressing. \n\u2022 Safe spaces \u2013 Youth leaders created six safe spaces in anganwadi centres and schools to \nprovide young girls an environment where they could have confidential and non-judgmental \nconversations about SRH; these were visited by over 560 young women and girls. While we \nreceived a positive response, we recognized the limitation of this approach with dependence \non youth leaders and the spaces themselves not being accessible by young girls \nindependently. We are re-visiting this and will test an approach where the safe space \nfacilitates unrestricted access \u2013 for example, creating online forums to facilitate these \nconversations, encouraging leadership by the yuva saathis who can work with their peers to \nidentify other such spaces and facilitate these conversations. \n \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective \nStrengthen an enabling environment supportive for adolescent girls and young women (ages 10-\n24 years) to meet their SRH needs in four existing intervention areas of Magrahat 1, Mathurapur \n1, Mathurapur 2, Kulpi in West Bengal \n \n \n \n7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nUsing the revamped strategy (similar to objective 1), we focused on nurturing a supportive \nenvironment for young women and adolescent girls. Our youth leaders reached adolescents and \nyoung women with rights-based SRH information through community and school sessions, \nnurtured support of community gatekeepers, and worked on normalizing SRH conversations at the \n \nOak Progress Report.    5 \ncommunity and family levels. Complementing this, we decentralized SRH services to lower-level \nfacilities and initiated capacity building of community-based young volunteers, yuva saathis. \nSummary of progress on project outcomes: \n1. Oriented 3,620 adolescents (10-19 years) and 1,260 young women on life skills, rights, \nand gender \nAdolescents \n\u2022 Youth leaders provided age-appropriate SRH information, especially the negative impact of \nearly marriage and pregnancy on their health and lives. \n\u2022 Along with foundational conversations on rights, emphasized on positive body image and \nself-esteem, respecting personal boundaries and the importance of open communication \nwith parents, peers, and healthcare providers on SRH issues. \n\u2022 Adolescents are more comfortable talking about SRH \u2013 they are vocal about their concerns \nduring sessions with youth leaders and are active during community events (like world \npopulation day) doing rallies, role plays, discussions on SRH etc that indicates this groups\u2019 \nimproved confidence and engagement with SRH issues. \nYoung women \n\u2022 Introduced them to the rights-based framework, with emphasis on delivering SRH \ninformation in a manner that is more relatable and resonates with them to facilitate behavior \nchange. \n\u2022 Through case studies and role plays, fostered understanding of the practical aspects of \ncontraception, and decision making processes involved in choosing and using contraception. \nWe learnt of a young woman who reported how the role play during the youth leader\u2019s \nsession gave her ideas on having a conversation with her mother-in-law that helped initiate \ncontraceptive use. \n       Please click the link Khadija's diary by ipasdevelopmentfoundation - Issuu for a representative \ncase. \n2. Sensitized 1,300 family members to play a supportive role \nSensitized mothers and mothers-in-law on SRH, especially addressing misconceptions \nhighlighted by young women, ranging from contraception being unnatural and causing weight \ngain or use of contraception impacting women\u2019s fertility. We also facilitated joint meetings with \ntheir daughters-in-law emphasizing the adverse consequences of teenage pregnancy and unsafe \nabortions, and encouraging them to support young girls for SRH-related care. \n3. Sensitized 25 PRI members and 25 SHG members on SRH \nTo garner support for young women\u2019s SRH, youth leaders oriented key community gatekeepers \non our intervention and the importance of SRH for young women. They have been helpful in \naddressing on-ground issues during community events and have supported youth leaders in \ninfluencing family members. \n4. Strengthened four public health facilities and associated Anwesha clinics for SRH \n\u2022 Oriented four providers and three Anwesha counsellors in the intervention facilities on the \namended abortion law, including providing a handout for reference. \n\u2022 Streamlined supply of injectable contraceptives by liasoning with the state FP nodal officer. \n\u2022 The period witnessed irregular services by counselors due to long leave or charge of \nadditional facilities. In such situations, counsellors relied on IDF youth leaders for reaching \nadolescents with SRH information and referring them to service providers. \n \nOak Progress Report.    6 \n\u2022 Identified some misconceptions using the SABAS tool such as IUCD can cause cancer, and \nbiases among providers against women who have an abortion. \n5. Strengthened eight HWCs to offer adolescent/youth-friendly SRH services/referrals. \n\u2022 Initiated and streamlined contraceptive provision through eSanjeevani by training on \ncontraceptives (focus on long-acting reversible contraceptives) for 8 ANMs and 8 CHOs \nand a telemedicine hub doctor[1]. \n\u2022 Strengthened four sub centres in the catchment area as referral points by orienting relevant \nstaff on SRH and referral linkages. \nWe facilitated provision of SRH services to over 53,000 young women, including 16,116 \nadolescent girls.

IDF led the \ninitial batch of training with support from selected youth leaders and conducted two rounds \nof training \u2013 a technical session on SRH, followed by skill building in areas such as \neffective communication, active listening, facilitation and group management and engaging \npeers to identify SRHR barriers. This experience has been both challenging yet rewarding \u2013 \nit required us to continuously tailor the training (considering their prior knowledge and \nexperience of SRH, cultural background etc) and be patient, creative and adaptive to varying \nrates of learning. However, the energy, enthusiasm to learn, and willingness of yuva saathis \nto work on the issue and support communities was incredibly fulfilling, and kept us \nmotivated. \n\u2022 We were unable to reach a strategic alignment with the organization for sustainable supply \nof low-priced sanitary napkins. \n \n \n \nOak Progress Report.    7 \n \n7.3.a.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nIn Year 1, we laid the foundation for our intervention by conducting a community survey and \nfacility-level assessment to identify gaps and better understand the needs of our target audience. We \nstrengthened the capacity of healthcare providers and community intermediaries to provide youth-\nresponsive services and streamlined SRH services, especially at health and wellness centers for \nimproved access. With this strong foundation and our outcome indicators in place, we are now \nprepared to focus our community-based efforts to improve SRH behaviors and practices. \n1. Selected intervention areas for community interventions: \nWorking in consultation with district and block health officials, we selected six gram \npanchayats covering 23 villages in the three intervention blocks for community outreach \nactivities prioritizing panchayats that were further from health facilities and had poor service \naccess. We also selected three facilities \u2013 RH Rudranagar, RH Dwariknagar and RH \nMadhabnagar \u2013 for facility-level interventions. \n2. Conducted community-based assessment: \nTo assess knowledge, behavior, practices and access barriers that young women and adolescents \nface, we conducted a cross-sectional community survey with 767 respondents (including \nadolescent girls, young women and men) in the three intervention blocks. Some key findings: \n\u2022 Young women and girls have high level of stigma, myths, and misconceptions related to \nSRH issues \u2013 most of them around menstruation (69%) and abortion (54%) \n\u2022 Agency is low \u2013 irrespective of marital status, young women and girls majorly rely on \nothers to take decisions on education, marriage, healthcare, and pregnancy. \n\u2022 They have poor negotiating ability \u2013 more than one fourth adolescents reported poor ability \nto negotiate with parents regarding continuing education or time of marriage. \n\u2022 About one third of male respondents reported having a positive outlook towards women\u2019s \nSRH. \n3. Developed outcome indicators: \nBased on the community assessment and our understanding of the current challenges, we \ndetermined outcome indicators and the expected level of change we anticipate by the project \nend. Please refer Annexure 2 for the indicator list. \n4.

Strengthened six HWCs to offer adolescent/youth-friendly SRH services and referrals: \na. Needs assessment: Conducted needs assessment in six HWCs, key observations: \n\u2022 Except one, all HWCs had a community health officer (CHO) in place \n\u2022 Facility staff reported/demonstrated gaps in technical knowledge on contraception, and had \nnot had any orientation on youth-friendly services \n\u2022 While most HWCs followed waste management protocol, there were major gaps in infection \nprevention, documentation and IEC on FP/adolescent health \n\u2022 Sub-optimal SRH service provision \nb. Capacity building: \n\u2022 Initiated injectable contraceptive (first dose) at five HWCs through eSanjeevani \n(telemedicine) \n\u2022 Conducted centralized training for ANMs from all six HWCs with sessions on modern \ncontraceptives, including model and hands-on practice on IUCD insertion; amendments to \nthe abortion law; adolescent SRH issues; and provision of youth-responsive services. The \nDeputy Chief Medical Officer Health attended the training and emphasized on teenage \npregnancy urging participants to focus on newly married young couples for delaying \npregnancy. \nc. Other support: Provided FP and SRH registers and oriented relevant staff on documentation; \nfacilitated display of IEC material on adolescent SRH and technical posters (such as \ninfection prevention) and provided reference aids for providers (including handout on \ncontraceptive methods and decision-making tool for contraception) \n6. Sensitized 169 community intermediaries to needs of adolescents and young women: \nSensitized community intermediaries through block-level orientations. The pre-test \nhighlighted attitudinal barriers \u2013 more than 80% believed that providing contraception and \nabortion information would mislead adolescents, that contraception should not be used before \nfirst pregnancy and that emergency contraceptive was for married women only. Over the next \nreporting period, as we initiate community outreach, we will focus efforts on addressing gaps \nin knowledge and garnering their support for adolescent SRH issues. \n \n \n \n7.3.c.

Service providers are non-committal and often tend \nto be non-supportive; there are huge gaps in technical knowledge and skills of facility staff; \nand documentation and recording is poor. The lack of effective monitoring due to the \n \nOak Progress Report.    9 \nremote location and the slow pace of work has resulted in interrupted service availability, \nwhich is further exacerbated for SRH services for young women. This provides us a huge \nopportunity to plug existing gaps and improve provision of regular SRH services for young \nwomen. \n\u2022 We identified prevailing contraception-related beliefs among health facility staff using the \nSABAS tool \u2013 newly married couples do not require contraception and prolonged use of \ncontraception can cause health hazards/make woman infertile.

The CBOs have initiated outreach activities \nwithin women & children in the communities which is helping them understand the different \ngender & child protection issues in the communities that needs to be addressed. The CBOs, limited \nto working with men of the communities on livelihood issues are now expanding their works with \nwomen & children in the communities. Women, children & adolescents from the communities are \nalso coming out for the first time as they find a platform to speak about themselves, share their \nconcerns. \nIncidents of gender-based violence, violence against children are being reported with increased \ninteractions of CBOs with women & children. This generated a need within CBOs to equip \nthemselves to deal with such situations of violence and accordingly training plans were made with \nPraajak. Since dealing with cases require different systems and mechanisms to be in place, \ndiscussions on setting up organizational policies & systems were initiated. Thus, the management of \nthe organizations have been part of discussions and planning on the development of child protection \npolicies so as to ensure proper reporting mechanisms & handling of cases. \nThe outreach activities are leading to formation of women and adolescent groups and there is a \nmove towards collectivisation and working with the collectives, identifying leaders & developing \nleadership skills. \n  \n \n \n \n7.1.c.

Based on the steady increase in footfalls to the clinics of FPA \nIndia, or the number of beneficiaries reached through community-based interventions, there is a \nsustained need for SRH interventions. The public health infrastructure within the operational areas \nis also reliant upon the FPAI teams for last-mile service delivery (Kalchini), or to conduct male \nsterilization procedures (Kolkata). Ever since the onset of the pandemic, FPAI has received \nrequests to increase the range of services provided (especially in Kalchini) and expand services to \nnewer geographies (particularly in Kolkata). Through this objective, it is proposed to increase \nresource allocation, optimize the utilization of available resources and improve the capacities of \nhealth care providers for improving access.  \n  \n \n \n \n7.1.b.

It aims to expand access to sexual and reproductive \nhealth and empower individuals and communities to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights \nwith gender equality, economic empowerment and thus poverty alleviation. \nThe project has been implemented in West Bengal through FPA India\u2019s Kalchini branch located in \nnorth of Bengal and FPA India Kolkata branch which is catering to the population of south Bengal. \nUnder the project, FPA India Kalchini branch has expanded the geographical reach with SRH care in \nMadarihat block of Alipurduar District. The Satellite clinic established by FPA India in Madarihat \nunder one of the specially funded projects for comprehensive abortion care was closed down after \nthe funding was stopped, with Oak Foundation\u2019s partial grant support, this clinic has been revamped \nwith the staff, commodities, and maintenance. It is now being accessed by the people in and around \nMadarihat block. This block is divided into a diverse culture of different communities like Bengali, \nNepali, Muslim, Adivasi, Rava, Mech, Garo & Toto, having their origin back to different places in \nIndia. The services provided at the Satellite clinic are being accessed by these communities and \nreferral for SRH care has been done with FPA India\u2019s Kalchini RHFPC.  With an expansion under \nASPIRE project, Kalchini branch has taken up 17 new tea gardens in Madarihat and also covering 9 \nnew tea gardens in Kalchini block which were not regularly covered due to accessibility issues. The \nexpansion is estimated to cover an additional 2,50,000 population together. \nFPA India Kolkata branch has been working in urban, peri-urban areas covering slum population in \nand around Kolkata including Howrah, Hooghly as well as parts of Sunderbans closer to the satellite \nclinics of FPA India Kolkata branch near Lake garden, Topsia and Rajarhat. Under ASPIRE project, \nit intervenes in south Bengal through to 5 selected blocks of Sunderbans, i.e. Basanti, Canning, \nGosaba, Kultoli in 24 south Parganas and Hingalganj block in north 24 Parganas. With an expansion \nin 24 Parganas, Kolkata would be reaching out to approximately 8,00,000 new population over the \nperiod of project. \nExpansion includes working with women, men, transgender population, female and male sex \nworkers  in selected areas of key population such as Sonagachi.   \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \nUnderstanding the health needs and capacities. \nKalchini: \nTo understand the communities\u2019 health needs, social heath determinants and current capacities of the \nexisting healthcare system, Kalchini conducted 7 FGDs with ASHAs, ANMs, AWWs, PRI members, \nTea garden health service providers and tea garden community members. The findings indicated the \nneed of clinical training to the current service providers for sexual and reproductive health. There is \nno apprehension amongst the community members for accessing services at the public health facility \nhowever, public health facilities and tea garden hospitals are not equipped with the staff and \ncommodities.  It is resulting in either people ignoring the health needs or availing health services at \nthe private health facilities. Most of the tea garden hospitals in the selected intervention areas are \nnon-functional and some tea gardens in Kalchini are accessed by the community but these hospitals \nare largely dependent on external sources like FPA India for commodities and services. \nKolkata (Sunderbans): \nIn Sunderbans however, in depth interviews were conducted with local women along with 26 FGDs \nwith local women and men\u2019s groups, frontline workers, PRI members because it was completely new \nintervention area taken by FPA India for SRH care. The healthcare infrastructure in Sunderbans in \nselected 5 blocks was found to be fragmented largely because of its locale which poses difficulty in \naccessing the islands. Institutionalized health care is either non-existent or inadequate. This leaves \nhealthcare choices for the people of these areas limited to indigenous healthcare providers using \nherbal medicinal supplements from forest resources and private healthcare providers which demand \nout of pocket expenses. There is a question on the qualifications of the private health care providers \nas well. Both the branches have started their interventions in the selected areas, however building \nrapport and increasing accessibility may take time for focused SRH intervention especially to avail \nsafe abortion care and services related to gender based violence. \nAdvocacy and networking with key stakeholders for health system strengthening. \nHealth systems and polices have a critical role in determining the manner in which health services \nare delivered, utilized, and affect health outcomes. Health is a state matter and therefore, to influence \nthe systems for positive outcomes, FPA India works in close partnerships with central and most state \ngovernments. With respect to West Bengal, FPA India is a Member in various district level \ncommittees like District Health & Family Welfare Samiti (Executive Member), District Task Force \nMeeting (Executive Committee Member), District MTP Committee (Executive Committee \nMember), Block Health & Family Welfare Committee, kalchini (Executive Committee Member) \nand Block Disaster Committee-Kalchini and Kolkata (Member) and the representative of FPA India \nfrom Kalchini and Kolkata participate in the meetings being held by these committee heads on \nregular basis. The Kalchini branch also attends regular district MIS meetings organized by the health \ndepartment to understand the progress, to review the available resources with district authority and \nprovide recommendations with district level policy makers. During the reporting period, 12 meetings \nwere conducted at district level which were attended by FPA India representative. Issues related to \nsafe abortion services and budget for Palaki ambulance project in Buxa Dooars were discussed \nduring these meetings and forwarded to State NHM.  As a result of previous series of meetings in \nthis regard and participation in 12 meetings during the reporting period, Buxa Dooars Palaki \nambulance project is sanctioned in District and state PIP by NHM.   \nThe Palaki ambulance is an initiative by FPA India as a public private partnership model (PPP) with \nhealth Alipurduar district health department to transport pregnant women and persons in need of \nfacility based emergency and other Medical care, including, Institutional delivery and other general \nhealth, from the terrain of the Buxa Dooars to the nearest Govt. Hospital. The Palaki is being used \nwith support of volunteers of FPA India and local people. \nIt has been equipped with informative materials on protection of girl child, institutional delivery and \nother SRH issues. It operates or twenty four hours per day, seven days a week, providing a Basic \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \nLife Support (BLS) medical care. Palki Ambulance\u201d has made a positive impact on pregnant women \nand the local populace and has been recognized by district health system as a best practice. \nCapacity building of health care providers. \nKalchini: \nKalchini branch conducted following meetings to plan capacity building trainings for SRH care for \nthe Government health care Providers during the reporting period: \n\u2022 Madarihat Rural Hospital under Madarihat Gram Panchayet which was attended by BMHO, \nMOs, GNMS- ANMS and 36 ASHAs from Madarihat. \n\u2022 Meetings with Birpara State General Hospital were attended by Superintendent, Mo and other \nstaff. \n\u2022 MOs and GNMs of Sisujhumra PHC, Sisubari PHC, Totopara PHC also attended the meetings \norganized for them to initiate the discussion for SRH trainings. \nKolkata: \n\u2022 One training on SRH care was conducted in Bharatghar Nursing Home in basanti by Kolkata \nbranch for the clinical and para medical staff. Apart from the nursing home staff,  7 private \nmedical practitioners from the Kochukhali and Satjalia gram panchayats in Gosaba block \nattended 1 SRH training each. \n\u2022 Kolkata branch conducted one meeting with the Basanti Gramin Hospital which was attended \nby BMOH and other staff. The focus of the meeting was SRH training and smooth referral \nfor general health care. It will need subsequent meetings and follow-up to train the staff to \nprovide the SRH care. \n\u2022 For the partnership with private health care providers, 2 RMOs, 30 on call doctors and 18 \nstaff nurses from the private hospitals in Birpara are at the discussion stage, trainings will be \nconducted, and partnership will be formalized with them in the 2nd phase. \n\u2022 A total of 182 ASHAs and 56 ANMS have been sensitized by Kalchini branch for SRH care. \nMobilizing champions to advocate for SRHR. \nKalchini: \nTotal 19 mothers clubs were formed in newly selected tea gardens by Kalchini branch wherein 190 \nnew women members were included in the group of network for SRHR and mitigation of gender \nbased violence. Members of the Mothers Club are community-based volunteers who work towards \ncommunity empowerment.   \nKolkata: \n\u2022 FPA India\u2019s intervention in Kolkata has resulted in formation of total 35 women\u2019s groups \ncomprise of 275 members across 15 gram panchayats. All the groups have attended at least 1 \nsession each on gender based violence and sexual reproductive health care. These groups will \nbe further strengthened to address the violence as well as to sensitize the young people from \nthe community on SRH and GBV issues. \n\u2022 Total 27 meetings were conducted for sensitization on SRHR and GBV with these groups. \nThe formal trainings will be conducted subsequently to strengthen the capacities for \nadvocating for the rights of women.  \n\u2022 Kolkata branch has appointed 6 new link workers in Sunderbans in 2023, along with \nthem,  local ASHAs and ANMS were mobilized through total 50 + meetings during the \nreporting period to sensitize about SRH care. Total 9 SRH trainings were conducted for these \nfrontline workers. \n \n \nOak Progress Report.    5 \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n\u2022 The local district authorities rely on the FPAI team in Kalchini to deliver last mile \ncontraceptive supplies and immunization services to needy populations in hilly terrains where \nthere are no motorable roads or government health facilities. While the intervention by FPA \nIndia helps to build partnership with Government, it consumes lot of resources in order to \nmake health care available and accessible to the most needy population. \n\u2022 It is challenging to get cooperation of BDOs for capacity building and interventions in \nSunderbans with health facilities as they expect approval from dept of Sunderbans affairs or \nstate government to implement activities. However, local administration like panchayat \nmembers are cooperative and provide support to the team. \n\u2022 The selected intervention areas of Sunderbans are financial and human resource consuming. \nThe meetings in regard to advocacy and partnership with government officials for capacity \nbuilding, trainings of grassroot level staff, doctors, and strengthening the hospital systems \netc.  require participation of experienced and senior staff at the initial stage. These areas are \ngeographically hard to reach and in order to return to the cities after intervention, teams need \nto adhere to timings of transports available. Hence, simultaneously meetings and service \ndelivery become difficult to cover both service delivery and advocacy aspects hence it also \nresults in delay/ slow progress.   \n\u2022 Currently there is no programme implementation plan being directly implemented as per the \nbudget at district level. District health administration has been collecting information through \nthe meetings conducted with public health officials and other partners where the issues of \nimplementation and special project budgets are being discussed. However, as the PIP of 2022-\n2024 is already done and revision will be done in 2023, there is no action, directive suggested \nso far. The 1st scope to put forward the suggestions would come in the mid- review meeting.  \n\u2022 While most of the Tea garden hospitals are defunct, the staff is present in the hospital and \nmany of them have not undergone any clinical training for a long time. This training will be \nconducted at the later stage when funds for commodities are strengthened at the tea garden \nlevel to ensure that the staff undergone training have sufficient commodities and resources to \nprovide these services.  \n \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective \nTo empower adolescents, young women, and key population groups from vulnerable and/or \nmarginalized communities with life skills and income generation opportunities in a gender-\njust environment. \nThis objective attempts to address norm change through gender-transformative interventions to \nsupport GBV survivors; create an enabling environment that pre-empts gender-based violence and \nsupports the rehabilitation of survivors, and works towards primary prevention of GBV and \ntransitioning of adolescents into responsible citizens through comprehensive sexuality education.  \n \n \n \nOak Progress Report.    6 \n \n7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nMobilizing young voices. \nKalchini: \nDuring the reporting period, FPA India Kalchini branch formed total 6 new youth groups in \nMadarihat block, which has been selected for an expansion. The groups have a total of 66 youth \nmembers from Gopalpur, Tulsipara, Singhania, Dalmore and Dumchipara. On forming the groups \nyouth members were oriented about the project and participated in the sensitization meetings \nconducted for them on gender-based violence, SRH and youth and safe abortion care. \nKolkata: \nKolkata branch formed 30 new groups in Sunderbans with young people across 5 blocks. The initial \nwork with young people had started in the areas which are connected to city by road like Basanti and \nCanning. The branch originally had some contacts in Basanti with CBOs and other Kolkata based \nNGOs who work in Basanti block on various issues. These earlier collaborations helped the team to \nbuild the rapport with young people during the initial health camps conducted in the villages of \nBasanti block.  Out of total 30 groups formed; 13 groups of 55 young people are formed in Basanti \nblock followed by Hingalganj in north 24 parganas which is an isolated block. Together in Jogeshganj \nand Sahenkhali of Hingalganj, there are total 7 groups formed with 34 young people. These groups \nare at the initial phase and in some areas,  the group is as small as 2 members at present. However, \nthese young people help the teams in mobilization, accompany them in case of meetings with stake \nholders etc. gradually they are expected to expand the group with their peers. \nCapacity building and connecting dots for partnership. \nKalchini: \n\u2022 FPA India Kalchini has a partnership developed with Birpara Welfare Organization for the \nreferrals of clients for livelihood skills learning. In the reporting year, total 8 gender-based \nsurvivors identified from the Madarihat areas were sent to Birpara Organization who attended \ntailoring course. \n\u2022 FPA India has initiated the partnership with NGO Pratham, a grantee NGO of Oak Foundation \nfor referrals of GBV survivors from north Bengal intervention areas to avail life skills and \nalternative livelihood opportunities. A pilot batch of identified GBV survivors will be sent to \nPratham and clients will be followed up for the retention of job opportunities provided to them \nby Pratham on completion of the course.   \nKolkata: \n\u2022 In Sunderbans meetings have been conducted with community members to understand the \nlivelihood options and women and young people from the community, have suggested few \noptions like bee-hiving, local spices and flowers business etc. However, it has been seen by \nthe community members as an opportunity for income generation in general and not specific \nto the women survivors of gender based violence. The concept of gender-based violence \nwithin the family and peripheries take time to shape up and communities in Sundarbans are \ngoing through the process of it and at initial phase.  \n\u2022 Another oak Grantee, Liver Foundation, has planned their intervention in Sunderbans and 3 \nmeetings have been conducted with Liver Foundation for the partnership. This partnership \nwill result in training the volunteers of Liver foundation in SRH and gender-based violence \nwho can further provide the care in the community.  \n \nOak Progress Report.    7 \nComprehensive sexuality education for young people \nKalchini: \n\u2022 In north Bengal, through FPA India\u2019s comprehensive Sexuality education programme total \n61 sessions were conducted in Madarihat through which 3,948 young adolescent boys and \ngirls from schools were sensitized, these participants were from class 7th to 11th. \n\u2022 For the out of school adolescents such 37 sessions were conducted on Relationship, \nCommunication Skill, HIV/AIDS, Safe Abortion, GBV, RTI, Contraception which reached \nout to 949 young people \nKolkata: \n\u2022 In Sunderbans the SCEs were conducted in the 8 schools. Total 350  school going children \nattended the CSE sessions as follows: Basanti ( 108 children), Goasaba ( 81 children), Kultoli \n( 55 children) and Hingalganj ( 106 children). \n\u2022 While partnerships with schools are taking shape in Sunderbans, the intervention in the \ncommunity via CSE sessions has much progressed. Total 64 sessions on CSEs were \nconducted across 5 intervention blocks which reached out to 1,220 young people. The \nresponse for these sessions in the community is highest in Kultoli block.  The community \nstrategy is also helping to build the rapport with parents and bringing young people together \nto advocate for SRHR. \nTaking the onus, capacity building of teachers for CSE \nKalchini: \nTo build capacities of the schoolteachers to conduct comprehensive abortion sessions for the \nadolescents, total 5 teacher trainings were conducted in north Bengal\u2019s schools which were attended \nby 63 teachers across 28 schools. On completing the ToT, total 35 sessions were conducted by the \nnewly trained teachers in the schools.   \nFPA India Kalchini branch\u2019s presence in Madarihat with comprehensive abortion care services is \nresulting in healthy partnerships with other stakeholders well. \nKolkata: \nTotal 8 ToTs were conducted by Kolkata branch for 40 teachers across 4 blocks except Canning. \nThe response to initiate the training independently was not very positive in Sunderbans. A top-\ndown approach may work, but it won\u2019t have the onus from the schools for sustained intervention \nwhich has been observed in Kalchini.   \n \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nIt is challenging to get cooperation of BDOs for capacity building and interventions in Sunderbans \nwith health facilities as they expect formal health and family welfare department, West Bengal to \nimplement any activities. At present, the blocks selected under Sunderbans have weak public health \nfacilities and it is a new geography for FPAI, hence, for the participation of ASHAs, AWWs, school \nstaff is taking time without formal approvals. While some of the ASHAs are very cooperative and \nsupporting during the health sessions being conducted, organizing capacity building trainings with \nthem in a big group at a time is difficult. However, local administration like panchayat members are \ncooperative and provide support to the team and with their help it will be taken up. \n \nOak Progress Report.    8 \n \n \n \n7.3.a.

Objective 3 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nStrengthening the access to sexual and reproductive health care: Outcome of satellite clinic \nunder the project in North Bengal (Kalchini): \n\u2022 Total 6,338 new clients registered at the Satellite clinic at Madarihat and availed the SRH \ncare. \n\u2022 Total 557 women availed the management of medical abortion during the reporting period.  \n\u2022 Total 157 new users received 10 years intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCD) at Satellite \nclinic which accounts to 6% contribution to the total IUCD insertion to women in the \nreporting period by Kalchini branch. \n\u2022 557 new women and 20,366 continued users availed the oral pills through Satellite clinic as \na family planning method. \n\u2022 2,626 women were screened for gender-based violence and provided counselling. \nStrengthening the access to sexual and reproductive health care: Reaching out to unreached- \nthe outreach intervention \nKolkata intervention: \nThe service delivery model for Sunderbans by Kolkata branch is through outreach based special \nservice sessions. During the reporting period, the team provided general health and sexual \nreproductive health care to total 8,745 people out of which 4,742 were women, mainly from \nreproductive age group. \nThe two most critical islands which FPA India has taken up under this project: Chota Mulla Khali \nand Kumirbari, provided health services to 570 people in just two outreach camps which shows the \nneed of health services in that area. Total 293 women benefitted through 2 camps on these islands. \nApart from common ailments and anemia, issues like white discharge, irregular menstruation were \nfound to be common amongst women.  These islands are away from the land and Hospital \naccessibility to Canning is not just cost extensive but also has limited transportation \noptions.  However, Chota Mulla Khali has a PHC in semi functional state where delivery facility is \nalso available.  So far, multiple meetings have been conducted with stakeholders in Chota mulla \nKhali, and the local leaders and members on village committee have shown willingness to work \naround health issues of people living on these islands.  FPA India Kolkata will be building capacities \nof the Hospital staff to provide sexual and reproductive services in subsequent phases which will help \nboth the island to avail health services at low cost and with regular intervals. \n \nOak Progress Report.    9 \nFor FPA India Kolkata, the 1st year of intervention was crucial to build rapport in selected blocks of \n24 Parganas. The capacity building of existing health facilities and health care providers for sexual \nreproductive care is a long process, hence, while the team was parallelly working around collating \ndata, building rapport with health facilities, establishing contacts with various local CBOs and \nfrontline workers, there were multiple visits conducted to the intervention blocks with the team of \ndoctors and para medical staff to provide the health care in the outreach camps. \nThe team conducted total 44 outreach health service sessions in the villages of selected 5 GPs ( 10 in \nBasanti, 9 in Gosaba, 11 in Kultoli, 5 in Canning, and 9 in Hingalganj)  with general health and sexual \nreproductive health care provision which benefitted total 8,745 people. 54 % of the population who \navailed services were women. \nThe branch also conducted 5 special service sessions in the high need areas of female sex workers at \nSonagachi, Tollugunj and Rambagan reaching out to 430 women, 65 men and 3 children from key \npopulation. While these sessions were focused on sexual and reproductive health, general health care \nwas also provided on demand. \nKalchini intervention in outreach: \nDuring the reporting period with support from Oak Foundation grant and FPA India\u2019s initiatives, \ntotal 49 health service sessions were conducted in new intervention area which were combined health \nsessions for general health and sexual reproductive health care. Total 2,223 community members \navailed the services out of which 1,471 (66%) were women in reproductive age groups, 533 (24 %) \nwere men and remaining 219 were children under 14 years.  \nThe outcomes of all Service delivery points: RHFPC, Satellite clinics, Associate clinics, CBDs \nand Outreach for Kalchini and Kolkata: \nThe following table[i] depicts collated impact of the SRH intervention done by FPA India\u2019s Kolkata \nand Kalchini branches.

More details on this are available in the", "Significant changes": "significant changes section. While there was a good response to reopening of satellite clinic, \nthere is sharp decline in the abortion care provided at the satellite clinic compared to the \nbaseline. Till 2020- mid 2021, this satellite clinic was supported with a special grant to provide \nfocused comprehensive abortion care. This support had given an opportunity to take medical \nmethod of abortion to the grassroot with the quality. The cost of these services is high, while \nFPA India is looking for other opportunities to revamp these services, reaching out with \nabortion care with same quantum is currently difficult within available budget. The loss of \nfunds has impacted the couple year protection also, which is calculated basis the contraceptive \nservices provided in the year. \n\u2022 The association with SHGs and LVGs has increased with 20% by inclusion of 73 new SHGs \nat both the branches. \n\u2022 As both branches entered into new intervention areas, a large number of clients availing \nservices were screened for gender-based violence and provided with the counselling. As a \nresult, with an additional 4,990 screening and counselling the number of GBV screening has \nalmost doubled ( 88% increase) from 5,670 to 10,660. \n\u2022 The Teachers\u2019 training on CSE were focused during the year which resulted in new \nassociations with total 512 teachers ( original intervention areas of FPA India and new areas) \nwho can be motivated further to conduct the SCE sessions in the schools. \nDisaster preparedness and MISP. \nThe intervention areas selected from Sunderbans are susceptible to natural calamities like cyclones \nthat can throw planned interventions out of gear, stretch health systems and exacerbate \nvulnerabilities. Therefore, under the project, disaster preparedness trainings are considered for the \ncapacity building of the community members and stakeholders. The intervention for disaster \npreparedness under ASPIRE project is anticipated in phase 2. FPA India has received a special grant \n: SPRINT IV, for the capacity building of the staff and community members for disaster preparedness \nthrough MISP (Minimum Initial Service Package) training.  During the reporting period, 1 MISP \ntraining was held in May 2023 where youth volunteers, local NGOs, local link workers, participated. \nAlthough the training was planned for 3 full days, it was conducted only for one day due to gram \npanchayat elections. A fresh training will be conducted in phase II. \nUnder SPRINT project, sexual and gender-based violence training was also conducted in Sudnerbans. \nThe topics covered in the training program were: concept of SGBV, contributing factors of SGBV, \nconsequences of SGBV, global and national SGBV prevalence, national legal frameworks, guiding \nprinciples of providing survivor centered care and communication skills. \nOne media sensitization program was organized in May 2023 by involving all the local and national \nnews channels to sensitize about disaster preparedness. \nNGOs like Sunderban KNS foundation, Indian Red Cross Society, Benkunthapur Shishu Seba \nKendra, Leprosy mission,  Satjelia Vivekananda Milan Sangh, SNP+, Sonagachi Durbar, Manab \nTirtha Sevashram, Human Rights Association participated and partnered for the MISP and disaster \nintervention.  \n[i] These are total impacts meaning they include impacts that were already being averted previously \nbecause some women were already using family planning services. \n[ii] The disability-adjusted life year is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number \nof years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.

Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n\u2022 Despite the doctors in the public facilities are more qualified and skilled than the private \ndoctors, their skills are not being utilized optimally for marginalized people. Frequent \nabsenteeism and unavailability of commodities are still leading to avoidance of public health \nfacilities by people. As a result, people visit local private practitioners, ignoring the available \npublic health units, and pay beyond their financial capacity. There is a persistent negative \nattitude towards public health facilities which has been observed and that will take time to \nchange while the work with facility and authority will continue to strengthen the system. \n\u2022 Since there was a provision of budget through special grant under humanitarian work being \nconducted by FPA India, FPA India Kolkata branch had planned more trainings with gram \npanchayat workers, secretaries and Pradhans in areas of Sunderbans, however due to gram \npanchayat elections, it had to postpone over two months. Post election, new people joined in \nsome of the GPs and rapport built with earlier people could not be utilized formally as a \npartnership with panchayat people. \n \n \n8. Significant changes.

Dr. S.K. Sikdar, Advisor, FP, MoHFW and his team attended the hands-\non training in Delhi.  Through this experience, the Country Lead for Jhpiego requested for a \ntraining program for 5 doctors from Assam which was conducted in January 2023.  Similarly, \nMoHFW planned national level training of 30 Master Trainers (MTOT) on insertion of \nsubdermal single rod contraceptive implants in 3 locations with the support of FPA India. \nThese trainings were conducted in Delhi, Dharwad and Kolkata. The participants for MTOT \nwere from Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and \nOrissa. The trainees majorly from Medical Colleges, will have to further conduct the implants \ntraining for service providers in their respective districts as per the plan formulated by \nMoHFW. \nDr. Rathnamala Desai, President, FPAI was the Core National Master Trainer for all the 3 \ntraining programmes. \n \nOak Progress Report.    13 \n\u2022 In year 2023, FPA India took a decision of re-looking the methodologies of collecting data at \ndifferent service delivery points. In the process, some of the branches including FPAI Kolkata \nbranch had to drop out some partner associated clinics due to their inability to meet the criteria \nof quality-of-care services expected to be delivered/ reported.  Hence, these branches of FPA \nIndia are unable to renew the partnerships and that has impacted the overall volume of the \ndata being reported for ASPIRE project. \n  \n \n \n9. Additional question(s): Please use this space to respond to any question(s) sent to you by the Oak programme team.  \nIf none were received, please leave this section blank. \n\u2022 What is the infrastructure in the gardens - are their social workers or women volunteers, local \ncommunities in these gardens? \nMother\u2019s club is an initiative in the tea Gardens for the community development through women \nempowerment with support from tea garden management. The chairperson of these clubs are the \nGarden Managers and the Hospital MO In-Charge or/ Labour Welfare officers or Assistant \nManagers plays the role of Member Secretary with 10 women members under each tea garden. \nFPA India works closely with these women volunteers in the tea gardens for the empowerment \nand enhancing sexual and reproductive health care in the tea garden community through the \nKalchini branch. These women are part of the community; hence, they are also available outside \ntea gardens for SRH care. \n\u2022 How did you arrive at the catchment population of 250,000? \nAs per the census 2011 population mentioned on \u2018Grammanchitra\u2019, the site of Ministry of \nPanchayati Raj, govt. of India which was referred for mapping, the population of Kalchini is \n3,85,108 out of which most of the areas FPA India is already working through intervention. The \npopulation of Madarihat shows 1,73,707 in 2022 census. The total population comes to \n5,58,815.  The Census site shows some indicator based expected increase in the population which \nconsidered following MoHFW published Population projection report, where, the population \ngrowth of west Bengal is  indicating 8%. Considering that, the estimated population of Madarihat \ncomes close to 1,90,000 . the remaining population estimation was taken for Kalchini\u2019s new tea \ngardens and few villages near Jaigaon are included. Thus, the estimation of 2,50,000 was \nconsidered for expansion. \n\u2022 Are there any of the clinical activities carried out in the gardens? \nApart from awareness and sensitization meetings, FPA India organizes special service sessions \nin the tea garden for general health care and SRH care. The screening of cervical cancer is also \ndone in the selected tea gardens for women. \n\u2022 Does this refer to the doctors or others as well? (The findings indicated the need of clinical \ntraining to the current service providers for sexual and reproductive health.) \n      This was with reference to the doctors as clinical service providers. \n\u2022 What is the contribution of the health department to the Palki Ambulance? \nFPA India volunteers have been active in Buxa doors to support for immunization, helping \nwomen to access hospitals for an institutional delivery. Kalchini branch had proposed the idea of \nPalki Ambulance to the district Administrator to ensure the safe and relatively easy transport of \npregnant women and other patients which was then proposed by him to health department for the \n \nOak Progress Report.    14 \napproval and implementation. The health department sanctioned the project implementation and \nalso planned to make more palkis which would be lighter in weight.  \n\u2022 Are there any training activities that target the doctors and nurses at the tea garden hospitals? \n(A total of 182 ASHAs and 56 ANMS have been sensitized by Kalchini branch for SRH care.) \nIn the past, FPA India had covered about 12 tea gardens for the training of clinical staff with \nsupport of special grant focusing on SRH care. However, in the last one and half years there are \nno trainings conducted for the tea garden clinical staff such as doctors and nurses. \n\u2022 Have you shared any recommendations from the FGDs findings with the department which \nmay have implications for the PIPs? \nThe recommendations were not shared in the meetings conducted so far. The data sharing in the \nmeetings was pertaining to the special project supported in Buxa Doors for SRH \nactivities.  However, it will be done in subsequent meetings where revisions in the PIP budget \nmay be considered. It will be done along with seeking approvals for the training of the doctors \navailable in the government facilities in Kalchini and Madarihat. \n\u2022 Can you share the age groups, gender and social profiles of the trainees? \nThe women referred for the livelihood skills trainings were mostly between the age groups of 30-\n35. Two amongst them were 24 years old. While all 8 were married at one point, the younger two \nwere deserted by their partners. All except one were survivors of domestic violence either by their \nintimate partners or family members. Four of them were from tribal community and three reported \nto be originally Nepali. \n\u2022 Since Gosaba is a common area for both, there is potential for providing comprehensive health \nawareness and referral services. \nDefinitely there is a potential to have for providing comprehensive health together. \nUnder the partnership with Liver foundation, FPA India will train all three categories of \nvolunteers of liver foundation in batches on sexual reproductive health, gender-based violence \nand minimum initial service package for humanitarian situations. On receiving trainings, \nvolunteers who are essentially from Gosaba block, can use the knowledge in the community along \nwith their dedicated work and also refer the clients when there is any health camp, they can also \nsupport in mobilization when the camps are being conducted. \n\u2022 Do you have sex-disaggregated data for the children and young people who attended these \nsessions? \nThe table below can explain gender disaggregated data for children and young people for the \nsessions attended in school and out of school (sessions in the community). Please note that the \ntable shared in the narrative report has data up to June 2023. The table shared below , has data up \nto July 2023 as received by the branches. Also, the data in the reporting system comes for entire \nintervention areas and not segregated for project specific. \n  \nTotal children and young people attended CSE sessions. 37,728 \nTotal male children and young people attended CSE sessions 14,349 (38.03%) \n  \nTotal female children and young people attended CSE sessions 23,340 (61.86%) \n  \nTotal other children and young people attended CSE sessions 39 (0.10%) \n  \n \nOak Progress Report.    15 \n    \nTotal children and young people attended CSE sessions in \nschools. \n25,153 (66.67% of the total) \nTotal male children and young people attended CSE sessions in \nschools. \n9,342 (37.14%) \nTotal female children and young people attended CSE sessions \nin schools. \n15,811 (62.86%) \n  \n    \nTotal children and young people attended CSE sessions in \nthe community (out of school). \n12,575 (33.33% of the total) \n  \nTotal male children and young people attended CSE sessions in \nthe community (out of school). \n5,007 (39.82%) \n  \nTotal female children and young people attended CSE sessions \nin the community (out of school). \n7,529 (59.87%) \n  \nTotal other children and young people attended CSE sessions in \nthe community (out of school). \n39 (0.31%) \n  \n  \n\u2022 Can you elaborate on some of the partnerships? (FPA India Kalchini branch\u2019s presence in \nMadarihat with comprehensive abortion care services is resulting in healthy partnerships with \nother stakeholders well.) \nThe partnerships with grassroot workers like ASHAs , AWWs which were developed earlier \nhelped the team to reach out to the community with health camps, and also to get referrals. While \npartnership with PRI members doesn\u2019t help in actually organizing the services, they were made \naware of the work being done in SRH field and the support of ASHAs , ANMs. Their support and \npresence in the outreach activities positively influences community people to access the services \nprovided in the outreach and also to access the Satellite clinic services. In terms of comprehensive \nsexuality education sessions, the classes taken earlier in the schools had helped to build \nrelationships with schoolteachers. Hence organizing ToTs resulting in teachers conducting the \nsessions  was possible within one year\u2019s time.  \n\u2022 How does the CSE module integrate aspects related to gender and diversity? \nFPA India has a comprehensive sexuality education module, designed to equip adolescents with \nknowledge, skills, attitudes and values related to sexuality and relationships. The aim of this CSE \nmodule is to encourage young adolescents to enjoy the growing up phase safely, responsibly and \nhealthily. As one of the components, \u2018Gender and Diversity\u2019 is introduced in the module. The \nsessions based on Gender and Diversity cover difference between gender and sex; exploring \ngender roles and attributes; understanding perceptions of masculinity and femininity within the \nfamily and across the life cycle; society\u2019s changing norms and values; manifestations and \nconsequences of gender bias, myths; and inequality, recognizing and understanding the range of \ndiversity in our lives (e.g., faith, culture, ethnicity, socio-economic status, ability/disability, HIV \nstatus and sexual orientation); recognizing discrimination, its damaging effects and being able to \ndeal with it; developing a belief in equality etc. \n\u2022 Have you spoken to IPAS in this regard as they have a strong presence in the state \ndepartments? \n \nOak Progress Report.    16 \nThere is an update on this which is of August 2023. At present, total 265 ASHAs and 2 ANMS \nhave undergone the training in Sunderbans on SRH. The meetings were conducted by FPA India \nKolkata BM in this regard with block medical officer of health, Basanti Rural Hospital and with \nhis directive and approval the training was conducted on 24th August in Basanti. \nFPA India has a partnership with IPAS independently for SRH work as well and wherever \napplicable, the partnership will be explored for work in Sunderbans. \n\u2022 Please send me the baseline reports as it was meant to provide the benchmarks to assess the \nannual progress. I suggest that you use them to reflect the % changes as currently the figures \nare mentioned in absolute terms.  Although the text  under the accomplishments is well-\nwritten, it will be great if you can refer to the approved outcomes in the future. Also, \nwherever applicable please provide sex- and social group- disaggregated data. \nI am sharing the baseline report separately as an attachment as it is a bit heavy in size. Also, \nhenceforth we will project the changes/ progress in the indicators as per the % change and \nalso basis the approved outcomes. \n\u2022 what is the strategy for engaging with the tea garden management for ensuring services to \nthe workers and their families ? and the plan to engage with state departments to inform \nprogrammes/policies based on the refined findings from  the FGDs and the direct \ninterventions? \nRegarding the strategies to engage the tea garden management for ensuring services to the \nworkers and their families, currently FPA India is providing the general health and SRH care \nservices in the Tea gardens along with awareness / sensitization meetings with \nmanagements\u2019  permission. The regular contact with other club members like youth club, \ncommunity clubs in the villages reflect in the referral services to the RHFPC to ensure the \nservices are accessible and affordable to the community women. FPA India has worked in the \npast with some of the tea gardens (about 12 gardens from Kalchini) and trained the clinical \nstaff, however, considering the turnover of clinical staff, referrals are made to the hospital for \ngeneral care and for SRH care mostly people prefer to come to FPA India.    \nAlso, as a next step, in December 2023, while PIP revisions may happen in review meeting, \nFPA India Kalchini branch has planned to send a proposal for special projects where the FDG \nfinding will also be presented. There will be an attempt to involve youth members or women \nvolunteers from the community during the meetings. \n\u2022 Is there a reason for not mentioning this source (Sprint IV) in the table 5 of the finance report? \nContribution of Sprint IV has been included under IPPF, as the grant is coming from IPPF, \nalso , inserting additional row was not working in the protected file.    \n\u2022 With respect to the finance report, please check the year 1 budget figures (both Total and \nOak)  from the grant letter as they do not match. Do let us know if you are expecting any \nrevisions in the year 2 budget. \nAs per instruction given in \u201cOak Budget to Actuals Report\u201d (please refer point no.4.) , the \n\u2018Annual budget\u2019 must match exactly what was approved In the grant letter unless a Budget \nRevision Form was approved, in which case the revised amount should be listed. Therefore, \nannual budget for reporting period showed  as per Budget Revision i.e. (Total project) INR \n183,04,576 & (OAK) INR 92,62,337. \nBasis the mail from Oak Foundation indicating the in principal approval on six field workers \nfor Sunerbans for the project period, some revisions are made in the budget along with \nadjusting the original budget. The revisions made will be shared by the Finance and Accounts \nteam for Year 2 (July 2023 to June 2024). The variance in % contribution is mainly due to \nadditional budget for field workers. \n \n \nOak Progress Report.    17 \n \nII.

Objective 1 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nBackground: \nUnder this project, the activities started with learning and understanding the process and  using the \ndifferent tools like social mapping, listing, scoring and ranking, power analysis, daily routine \nactivities, mobility map, migration chart, SWOC (strength weakness opportunity and challenges) \nanalysis of the vulnerable families under participatory vulnerability and capacity assessment, base \nline study were done. \nThere were vulnerabilities found among the marginal farmers families, women particularly of women \nheaded families, agri-labourer, landless labourer and migrant labourer, adolescents both boys and \ngirls of the resource poor families particularly, aged and physically challenged persons, who are in \nvery difficult situation in socio-economic, environment and cultural point of view. \nOn the basis of the findings of vulnerabilities came out, the micro plan chalked out. Accordingly the \nprocess of empowering of the community groups started with them after prioritization of the problems \nof the reference groups of adolescents, women, marginal farmers and labourers, aged and physically \nchallenged persons. \nThe three reference villages are 1) Ram Nagar Abad, 2) Gurudaspur, 3) Paschim Sridhar Pur of \nDigambarpur Gram Panchayat of Pathar Pratima block of Sundarban, West Bengal, India. \nThe activities   were as follows: \nAdolescents both boys and girls groups formed: \n       Total groups of adolescents formed : 14 (one boys and one girls group, other 12 are mixed \ngroups) \nTotal members of those 14 groups are 312 (boys-70, girls-242) \nBecoming proactive to take action thinking in a safe space of knowledge building, \nunderstanding and sharing and trust building: \nAdolescents are beginning to think and sharing their problems with peers, where confidentiality is \nalso maintained, where there is free and open space for sharing and understanding with game mode \nof facilitation, question and answer session, storytelling, interacting session etc. \nThey have started to think on doing some work and taking shared responsibility for any action of \nplantation and nurturing, plastic collection and rejection campaigning, wall writing and wall painting \nfor community awareness, other social actions. Collective leadership is promoted among them. \nInterest grown among the adolescent groups getting opportunities of fun and learning together. \nBonding and friendship made among the adolescents with identity mapping, ground rules setting, \ngoal setting etc. \nBehavior changes among boys, they realized that girls should be regarded equally with boys where \neve- teasing and other negative thinking and behavior towards girls should be changed and stopped \nand treated equally. Negative mannerism that is demeaned to girls customarily by boys is being \nreduced as the girls shared. \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \nParents are being cooperative and supportive towards engagement of their children. Parents are \nspending time with children, talking to them, listening to their views. Building strong relationship \nand understanding with the parents of adolescents on their engagement in groups/collectives and \ndiscussion on building knowledge, and change of attitude and behavior in daily life. \nPlanning to collectively talk to panchayat for regular supply of sanitary pad for the adolescent girls. \nAlso to go in to dialogue with school authority for hygiene to be maintained at school toilet for girls \nparticularly. Knowledge building of the adolescent groups on gender, wants and need, basic human \nrights, child rights, know yourself, understanding on societal context, adolescent health and hygiene, \nissues of menstruation, thinking and understanding of what is right and wrong concepts and practices \nduring menstruation cycle, physical and mental or emotional changes of adolescent ages, which is \nnatural and normal as realized. \nThe other changes what are seen among the groups of adolescents as follows: \ni. The adolescents both boys and girls have mutually accepted the physically challenged, \nminority group(muslims), school drop out and all the castes altogether in their groups, \nbonding and friendship made with each other. \nii. They are attending meeting regularly as scheduled. Their parents are also becoming \ncooperative. \niii. Case of sexual abuse is shared with field worker. Free and open space created where they are \nsharing their opinion, problems and thinking to mitigate the same. \niv. They have built trust on the facilitator as their friend and guide. They are gradually able to \novercome their uneasy complexity to express views and opinion on issues and matters, what \nthey cannot share with parents and members of their families. Few cases of child abuse, school \ndropout, and early marriage have come out. \n\u2022 Collective action taken so far by the adolescent groups- in progress: \ni. Celebration on Children Day: \nii. Collective action by the adolescent collectives on awareness on pandemic: \niii. Peer to peer support to reduce school dropout and child labour: \niv. Advocacy for VLCPC formation : \nv. Celebration of world environment day, wall painting, plantation by the adolescent group: \nvi. Plastic rejection propagation drive by the adolescent groups and plantation: They have also \nplanned to continue the process initiated by them to collect plastics on regular basis at their \nhome and surroundings, which will be collected by the panchayat sending van to their locality. \nvii. Celebration of independence day by the adolescents group: \nviii. Engagement of adolescent groups with local water user committee: As per their aspiration it \nshould be functioning well for the benefit of the water user families and the community at \nlarge. The adolescent group also said that they would also visit and meet another water user \ncommittee where the problems if any, can be solved in this way. \nix. They have begun to have sanitary napkin from the health personnel where some are hesitate \nto talk. \nActivities with Physically challenged adolescents: \n10 adolescents of 10-16 years of age group identified and households visited. Out of ten, the three \nhave no registration card i.e. certificate of disability. \nThe respective families are trying to contact with subdivisional hospital of Kakdwip to have their \ndoctors certificate at first and then to apply for handicapped certificates. \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \nThe others seven have card and accessed the social security scheme of Manobik pension. \n  Marginal farmers group formed: \n\u2022 Total farmers group formed : 7 \n\u2022 Total members involved with the farmers group: 127 (M-  14, F- 113), \nFarmers are beginning to learn and expose skill and knowledge, understanding, sharing and \npractices of agro-eco system management: \n\u2022 Mostly women farmers are engaged in the process of development and coming forward with \ntheir leadership.

Fruitful discussion cannot be \nhappened with active participation from all as the absentees are unable to link thoughts with \nnew content. \n\u2022 Particularly boys of 16+ are less interested to join the group, is a great challenge to bring them \ninto the process. \n\u2022 School time and sometimes sudden and frequent changes of tuition time of the adolescent \nboys and girls did not match with the time of meeting. \n\u2022 Basically farmers are reluctant to adopt new scientific method of farming due to their \nnegligence of hard toil. Sometimes they present lame excuse to avoid this cultivation process. \nInstead women are becoming interested and given focus. \n\u2022 Farmers mostly expect some material supports of direct gain. Few farmers think, it would be \nof help in farming. \n\u2022 Some parents are having less caring and importance over their siblings, which cause \nirregularities in attending adolescent meeting. \n\u2022 It is difficult to have much number of male farmers in time of training or discussion due to \ntheir busy schedule of livelihood activities and having lack of interest to join. \n\u2022  Heavy rainfall, tuition, occasion and festival cause to postpone the session of adolescent \ncollectives. \n\u2022 Men and women are also busy in household chores, very less time in hand to attend meeting \nas they shared. \n\u2022 Some are also hesitating to talk. \nLearnings and adjustments: \n\u2022 Rapport building with the community is to be made very intensively. \n\u2022 Ensure community participation in any session growing interest among the participants \nthrough creating an open and learning environment, a special day for them. \n\u2022 More information and more support which is beneficial for community are to be provided, \nwhere they are also facilitated to thinking any new for their own. \n\u2022 Home visit with interaction on regular basis with the parents/farmers for trust building and \nclearing of any doubt can be a good strategy. \n\u2022 Community leadership and feeling of ownership by the community would be effective in \nexecuting any plan. \n\u2022 Regular monitoring and handholding support to the reference people are to be provided. \n\u2022 Date, time and venue of meeting are fixed by the community as convenient for them. \n \n \n \n7.2.a.

The surveyors had to explain these schemes \nand how the tea workers could benefit from them. \nKey Learning \nOverall, the study highlights the need for greater awareness and accessibility of  Government \n\u2018Social Protection\u2019 schemes for tea garden workers in West Bengal. There is a need for robust \nmechanisms to be placed to ensure that all the tea garden workers receive benefits from these \nschemes. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n7.2.a.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nSwaniti initiative collaborated with the Department of Post, Government of  West Bengal, and \norganized the Aadhaar enrollment and Correction camp in Balasun, Dhooteria, Lingia, and \nGopalpur Tea Gardens. The camps aimed to reach out to as many people as possible and efficiently \nconduct the enrollment and correction processes. These camps successfully reached out a total of \n1,309 beneficiaries, further to which Swaniti will work on linking these beneficiaries to different \ngovernment schemes. \n  \nExample: A voice from the community - \n  \n\u201cHello my name is Sujata Manger and this is my son Ankit Manger he was unable to \nobtain an Aadhaar card, but thanks to this camp, he was able to get it without difficulty. He \nis not alone, there are a number of other people in the tea garden who also do not have \nan Aadhaar card. I am now optimistic that my son will be able to access different \ngovernment schemes after getting his Aadhaar card\u201d - Sujata Manager - Dhajea TG, \nDarjeeling \n  \nOutcomes of the Aadhar Correction Camps: \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \n1. The camps were able to enroll and correct the Aadhaar details of a total of 1,309 \nbeneficiaries. These beneficiaries were able to obtain their Aadhaar cards without any \ndifficulty and ensure their details were updated and accurate. \n2. Many tea garden workers in the vicinity, including Tumsun TE, Munda, Miling, Kalej \nValley TG, and Samirkpani TE, were able to get their Aadhaar cards corrected conveniently \nas a result of the camps. This helped them avoid the inconvenience and expense of traveling \nlong distances to access Aadhaar services. \n3. The teams working at the camps conducted awareness sessions to educate people about the \nimportance of Aadhaar and its benefits. This helped people understand the significance of \nthe Aadhaar card and its role in accessing various government schemes and services. \n4. The successful acquisition of Aadhaar cards by the beneficiaries will enable them to access \nvarious government schemes and services with ease. This will help them avail themselves of \nimportant benefits and support provided by the government. \n5. The Aadhaar card helps the government to maintain accurate and updated data on tea garden \nworkers, which can be used for planning and policy formulation. \nOverall, Swaniti's efforts to link tea garden workers with different government schemes through the \ncorrection of their Aadhaar cards will help ensure that tea garden workers have access to the \navailable social protection schemes, thereby building a more inclusive and equitable society in \nWest Bengal. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nChallenges: \nOver the course of one year, a number of attempts were made through various channels in order to \nestablish convergence and acquire the necessary permissions for conducting Aadhaar camps. These \nefforts were made in the face of significant opposition from various stakeholders (like private \nassociations, local leaders, etc.) who stood to benefit from maintaining the existing status quo, \nrather than facilitating social and financial inclusion for the dependents of tea gardens. The \nopposition that the team encountered was multifaceted and ranged from vitriolic political \ninterference sometime creating a major bottleneck in service delivery. Despite these challenges, the \nteam was able to organize Aadhaar Enrollment/ correction camps that enabled more than 1300 \ndependents to become eligible for a range of social welfare schemes.  \nLearnings: \nAs a learning strategy, Swaniti plans to onboard the district administrations of all four districts \nwhen organizing the Aadhaar camps and other interventions for a smooth flow of work processes. \nSwaniti also plans to onboard and work with the  forms of government and private ( Team \nassociations) stakeholders to reach the maximum number of garden workers through the \nintervention plan in place. \n  \n \n \n \nOak Progress Report.    5 \n \n7.3.a.

We are in the process of creating pockets of evidence that can \nwork as proof of concepts for scale up and adoption by the key decision makers. To achieve this we \nhave designed the following strategy : \nNeeds assessment: \nA thorough needs assessment was conducted to identify the specific challenges faced by tea garden \nworkers in accessing social protection schemes. That includes issues related to documentation, \naccess to information, and barriers related to caste or gender. \nStakeholder mapping and engagement: \nTea garden workers themselves, as well as community leaders, civil society organizations, and \nother Government stakeholders, were mapped to be engaged in the policy development process, \nensuring that the needs and perspectives of the aforementioned groups are considered. \nCapacity building: \nThe policy framework includes provisions for building the capacity of tea garden workers to access \nand utilize social protection schemes. This includes training on documentation and application \nprocedures, as well as outreach and awareness raising efforts to ensure that workers are aware of \ntheir rights and entitlements. \nInterdepartmental coordination: \nCoordination between different government departments and agencies being crucial for ensuring \nthe effective implementation of social protection schemes, the policy framework works to ensure \ninterdepartmental coordination and collaboration. \nMonitoring and evaluation: \nRegular monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the policy framework involving \nregular feedback from tea garden workers and other stakeholders, as well as quantitative data on \nenrollment and utilization of social protection schemes. \nGrassroots implementation: \nThe implementation of the policy framework ensures that tea garden workers are aware of the \navailable schemes and their accessibility. \n  \n \n \n \nOak Progress Report.    6 \n \n7.3.c.

The Jute Mills in the state employs around 25000 women workers and the number is \nconstantly increasing over the past two years.

These reports will serve as an important \ndocument on the safety of women workers in the jute mills and tea plantations. \nThe Situation Analysis in Jute Industry was conducted in 2019 among women workers of 6 Jute Mills \nand leadership of 7 Jute Federations and 6 Jute Unions in Hooghly and North 24 Parganas districts. \nThe Situation Analysis in Tea Plantations was conducted in 2022 and covered government and non-\ngovernment stakeholders like the district administration, the Labour Department of GoWB, the tea \ngarden management, trade unions, tea associations; besides the women workers themselves from 24 \ntea gardens in two (Dooars and Terai) of the three tea growing regions. \nSome of the key findings common to both industries that have emerged from the two independent \nstudies are: \n\u2022 Lack of awareness regarding safe workplaces (including sexual harassment of women at \nworkplace (SHW), the POSH Act, 2013 and its provisions) of almost all respondents in the \njute mills & the tea gardens. \n\u2022 Compliance with the Act is marginal. \n\u2022 The issue of safe workplaces, in the context of sexual harassment, has not even been \nconsidered to be an integral component of working conditions or labour rights of women \nworkers. \nThe very large numbers of women employed in the two industries studied are vulnerable due to their \nposition at the bottom of the hierarchy, casualisation of employment, overall isolated and dependent \nwork conditions which are further compounded by poverty, low wages, migration status, domestic \nviolence and low literacy levels. \nThe government departments like the district administration (District Officer) who is responsible for \noverall implementation of 2013 Act in the respective districts or the labour department who is \nresponsible for overall welfare and rights of workers have not adopted any appropriate measures \ntowards ensuring safe workplaces for marginal women workers. \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \nSanhita has utilised the Situation Analysis findings as a tool for advocacy and intervention with \nmultiple stakeholders. The outreach to women workers has been channelled through intense and \nconsistent engagement with the Trade Unions who are directly working with them. Parallelly Sanhita \nconducted evidence-based advocacy with the employers, employers\u2019 association, Labour Department \nand District Administration for creating safe workplaces for its women workers through \nimplementation and monitoring of the 2013 Act. \nOverall Outcomes in both Industries \n\u2022 Knowledge Creation on status of safe workplaces for marginalised women workers: The \n2 Situation Analysis studies have created thus far unavailable information and evidence on \nthe safety of women workers in the jute mills and tea plantations in West Bengal. \n\u2022 Voices of Women Workers were documented and shared with relevant stakeholders: \nThe hitherto unheard voices of the underrepresented women workers in the jute mills and tea \nplantations were brought to light by Sanhita through Situation Analysis study and the \nintervention programmes. The voices served as evidence for Sanhita\u2019s dialogue and advocacy \nwith the key stakeholders like the monitoring bodies, the employers and the trade unions. \n  \n\u2022 The plight of the women workers in Jute Mills and Tea Plantations get highlighted in \nprint Media articles: During the course of dissemination of the Situation Analysis findings, \nSanhita organised 2 centralised meetings with the Jute Mill Unions and Tea Plantation Unions \nrespectively. These events and the study findings got very well covered in the media articles. \nFollowing this different groups working with marginal/unorganised workers have reached out \nto Sanhita seeking further information. The Situation Analysis report soft and hard copies \nhave been widely disseminated among these different groups and organisations. \nMajor Outcomes in Jute Industry \n\u2022 The Employers got evidence-based knowledge of the SHW issue and the implementation \nstatus of the 2013 Act: \nThe findings of the Situation Analysis were shared at all levels, the Labour Department, GoWB, \nEmployers\u2019 Association and Trade Union Leaders. In case of the Jute Industry, taking this \ninformation to Indian Jute Mill Association (IJMA) was a critical need as IJMA is an apex \norganisation representing the management of the jute mills in India.  In a scenario where reaching \nout to IJMA was proving to be a challenge, the Labour Department\u2019s timely intervention helped \nimmensely. The Labour department, which was already well acquainted with Sanhita\u2019s work, \ntook cognizance of its efforts and referred Sanhita to the Indian Jute Mill Association (IJMA). A \nseries of dialogue and interactions with the Addl. Labour Commissioner and IJMA Chairman \nresulted in the initial capacity building of member jute mills of IJMA.  Sanhita collaborated with \nIJMA for a day-long orientation for Senior profile officers representing Human Resource, \nPersonnel & Administration Departments and the Labour Officers of the Jute Mills. Further \ncapacity building for HR/ Labour Officers of the member jute mills of IJMA shall be conducted \nin collaboration with IJMA in 2023-24. \n\u2022 Recommendations for implementation of the POSH Act were acknowledged by the \nEmployers and Trade Unions:  \n\u2022 IJMA agreed to collaborate with Sanhita in this initiative. It has a total number of 35-member \njute mills, out of which 33 owned by 29 companies are located in West Bengal. Sanhita \nreceived requests from member jute mills for further capacity building of the HR of the Jute \nMills to develop systems of prevention and redress of SHW. Based on the requests Sanhita \nplans to collaborate with IJMA for conducting the Orientation Programs in 2023-24.  \n\u2022 The Trade Unions acknowledged their lack of awareness regarding the issue & the 2013 Act \nand also recognized the need to include sexual harassment free safe workplaces on their \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \nagenda and focus on rights education for women workers. This becomes more relevant in the \ncontext of gradually increasing number of women workers in the jute mills, and their proposed \nengagement in the night shift. Senior leaders of the Trade Unions agreed to collaborate with \nSanhita in conducting a series of Orientation Programmes on the rights of women workers in \nthe jute mills as laid down in the 2013 Act. Till March 2023, Sanhita had conducted 5 such \norientation programs covering 8 jutes mills in collaboration with 2 trade unions. \n\u2022 Implementation of 2013 Act becomes part of the agenda of the Trade Unions: \nFinally, as a result of Sanhita\u2019s continued dialogue and interactions with the trade union \nleaders \u2013 central & mill based, over the past four years, the issue of SHW has been included \nin the Charter of Demands of the Jute Mill Workers dated 28th January 2022. Point No 8 (b) \nof the Charter of Demands addressed to the Labour Department and the jute mill owners says: \n\u201cSeparate rest rooms, wash rooms, creche should be provided. \nLaws relating working women \"The Prohibition of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace \nAct, 2013'' must be strictly adhered to and Internal Complaint Committee should be formed as per \nlaw\" \n  \nMajor Outcomes in Tea Plantations: \n\u2022 Representative of Labour Department has expressed willingness to facilitate \nengagement with Tea Associations and Management: Through continued dialogue and \ninteraction over the past two years with the Tea Advisor to the Labour Minister, GoWB, has \nacknowledged Sanhita\u2019s work and referred Sanhita to tea associations during the Situation \nAnalysis study.  The findings of the study were shared with him and he has agreed to extend \nsupport to Sanhita and advised Sanhita to dialogue with the Labour Secretary and seek support \nduring orientation for the tea associations and management.  \n\u2022 Intervention Plan in place for taking forward the initiatives: Based on the Situation \nAnalysis findings and recommendations received on the Situation Analysis report from \ndifferent stakeholders, Sanhita has developed an Intervention Plan to reach out to The \nEmployers \u2013 tea garden owners and management, The Tea Associations, The District \nAdministration, the Labour Department, The Trade Unions and Women Workers with the \ninformation about SHW Issue, provisions of the Act, rights covered in the Act, complaint & \nredress mechanism. \n           Gaps & recommendations for implementation are acknowledged by the Trade \nUnions:  The findings of the Situation Analysis study were shared with 37 senior profile Trade \nUnion leaders, both central and garden level. It has been a challenge to             bring different \nunions together and create a synergy on the issue and needs of the women workers. With persistent \nefforts, the unions have agreed to collaborate with Sanhita in organising orientation programmes for \nwomen workers and garden level             union leaders on the issue of SHW and the Act at zonal \nlevel of Terai and Dooars region. \n \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n\u2022 There is risk on the part of the women workers to raise the issue either in small group \ninteractions or openly in any meeting as the majority of the women are casual workers and \nthere is fear of losing work if they talk about their experiences or complain against their \nsuperiors. \n \nOak Progress Report.    5 \n\u2022 Trade Unions had neither prioritised the issue of safe workplaces in the context of SHW nor \nhad any clear concept about the issue and the Act. \n\u2022 Trade Unions in West Bengal are still dominated by male leadership. Raising the issue of \nSHW in this patriarchal bastion posed a serious challenge. Sanhita developed a strategic \npartnership with a civil society organisation, Nagarik Mancha who has a long history of \nworking on labour rights issues. The partnership helped reaching out to the Trade Unions and \ncreating a positive influence among the Trade Union leadership in recognising the work of \nSanhita and the importance of the issue of SHW. \n\u2022 Major roadblock was faced in reaching out to the jute mills employers. Sanhita\u2019s long \nassociation of working with the Labour Department helped reaching out to the jute mill \nemployers through IJMA. \n\u2022 The tea gardens in the state are undergoing a massive state of turmoil. The workers are \ndemanding for land patta and implementation of Minimum Wages Act in place of Plantation \nLabour Act, which means a paradigm shift in the wage structure in the tea gardens. \n\u2022 Moreover, the political situation in the Hilly Regions is also volatile. Reaching out to the tea \nplantations workers, grassroots trade unions and the tea garden management and raising the \nissue of SHW in the hilly region posed a major challenge amidst such a situation. \n          Labour department has not included the issue of SHW and its prevention on their agenda and \nthey do not consider themselves the enforcing authority for the 2013 Act. \n \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective \nTo create access of women workers to information regarding SHW Issue & the SHWW Act \nthrough various institutions and support redress of complaints \n \n \n \n7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nSanhita has taken multiple routes to ensure that marginal women workers gain access to the \ninformation on SHW issue, the 2013 Act and their rights to a safe workplace. One of this has been \nintegral to the intervention process both during the course of conducting the Situation Analysis as \nwell through sharing the findings of the report with the women workers. The other approach has been \nthrough dissemination of stakeholder specific IEC materials which provided information both on the \nissue and the Act.  \nWomen Workers in the Jute Mills received information on the issue of SHW and the 2013 Act \n\u2022 Through a series of orientation sessions, it has been possible to directly reach out to 225 \nworkers from around 8 Jute Mills in the Hooghly and North 24 Parganas districts. 86% of the \nworkers i.e 194 were women. Strategically, some interested and active male workers were \nalso included in these orientation programmes. \n\u2022 The programmes were organised in the Muhallas of the jute mills in Gate Meeting style. \n \nOak Progress Report.    6 \n\u2022 The women workers who participated initially with trepidation have over a period of time \ngained the confidence to speak out about their own experiences in the workplace and instances \nof sexual harassment faced. \n\u2022 There has been a gradual swell of women\u2019s active participation in the meetings as well as \nwithin the unions. \n\u2022 Trade Unions collaborated with Sanhita in this initiative. They took an active role in selecting \nthe meeting venue in the vicinity of the jute mills, ensuring participation of the women \nworkers from the adjacent jute mills and arranging logistics for the programmes. \n\u2022 The meetings served as a platform for raising the awareness of the women workers on the \nissue, the Act and their rights as workers. This understanding of their rights is what is \nmotivating the women to break their silence and speak out. \nReaching out to Women Workers in the Tea Gardens \nA similar process is underway with select Tea Gardens in North Bengal wherein the findings of the \nSituation Analysis will be shared with the women workers in the plantations. This initiative has \nalready been included in the Intervention Plan for 2023-2024.  \nStakeholder specific IEC Material \nPrimer on the POSH Act, 2013 \u2013 A comprehensive document in English which presents the \nprovisions and nuances of the POSH Act, 2013 in a lucid and easy to understand format. This has \nbeen extensively shared with Employers, Employers\u2019 Associations, Internal Committees (ICs), \nNGOs & Human Rights Activists, Monitoring Bodies and the Trade Unions. The Primer is being \ndisseminated in both soft and hard copies.  \nBooklet in Bangla (\u2018Karmakhetre Jouno Henosthar Mokabilay Narikarmee\u2019) \u2013 In a scenario where \nthere was not a single material available on SHW issue and the Act in Bangla language which could \nbe read and understood by women workers Sanhita developed and printed this booklet. It not only \nexplains the issue and the Act in simple language but also gives practical information on what women \ncan do during a crisis situation. The booklet has been disseminated to marginal Women Workers and \nTrade Unions among others. \nThere has been a demand from the unions in North Bengal & the Jute Mills for the booklet to be \nprovided in Hindi and the translation has already been completed and printing in progress. \nLeaflet in 3 languages (Say No to SHW) \u2013 Printed in English, Bangla and Hindi the leaflets provide \na snapshot view of the Act viz a viz employers responsibility and women\u2019s workplace rights. This \neasy to comprehend content has been extensively circulated among women workers and other \nstakeholders. These leaflets are also available in white board animation format. \nSituation Analysis Reports \u2013 The Situation Analysis not only captures the voices of women workers \nin Jute Mills and Tea Plantations, but its findings are also being taken back to the women workers so \nthat they gain an understanding regarding the status of safety at their own workplaces. \nSanhita\u2019s footprint at the Kolkata Book Fair 2023 \u2013 Sanhita\u2019s strategic partner Nagarik Mancha\u2019s \nstall at the Kolkata Book Fair was dedicated to the issue of Marginal Women Workforce. The stall \nhad a display of all of Sanhita\u2019s IEC materials which were widely disseminated. The issue of SHW \nin the context of marginal women workers got highlighted for the first time ever at a prestigious event \nsuch as the Book Fair. \nCrisis Intervention Services \nTo support redress of complaints, Sanhita adopted multi-pronged strategies \u2013 support to aggrieved \nwomen, support to SHW Committees in dealing with complaints, identification of procedural and \nknowledge gaps in handling of SHW complaints, and understanding of barriers in effective case \nredress for strengthening the justice delivery mechanism in the capacity of external member, support \ngroup or advisor. \n \nOak Progress Report.    7 \n  \nIn the capacity of External Member \nPresently Sanhita is representing at about 14 Complaints Committees across Education Institutions, \nMedical Colleges & Hospitals, Central & State Government offices which employ a large number of \nwomen workers and/or working as Sanhita\u2019s strategic partners. These SHW Committees receive \ntechnical support at regular interval from Sanhita to deal with the complaints effectively. \nIn the past one year (April, 2022 \u2013 March, 2023) Sanhita has dealt with 5 complaints in the capacity \nof External Member in the Internal Committees (ICs) and in two cases Sanhita has played the support \nrole. 1 case has been reported in a Security Force of Central Government, 2 cases were from a Central \nGovernment organisation and 2 cases were from 2 different Medical Colleges & Hospitals.  \nAs a result of Sanhita\u2019s presence, facilitation and participation, the following outcomes were \nachieved in dealing SHW complaints in the ICs.  \nThe procedures were followed properly, the case was conclusive and aggrieved women received \njustice through the Internal Committee in the Security Force of Central Government and 2 Medical \nColleges and Hospitals. \nIn one case of the central government organisation, ICs had to take Ex-parte decision due to absence \nof complainant in three consecutive hearings and in another case, the IC has submitted report of the \npreliminary inquiry to the disciplinary authority recommending the need for final inquiry as the IC \nhas found merit in the complaint during the preliminary inquiry. \nAs a result of Sanhita\u2019s advocacy, a central government organisation employing a large number of \nwomen has launched its online complaint format on SHW. \n  \nIn the capacity of Support Group and Advisor \nIn the past one year, Sanhita also provided the technical support to the Presiding Officers, Members \nand External Members. On 10th February, 2023, Sanhita conducted a centralised training for the ICs \nfrom 9 government department/organisations, 19 non-government organisations and 8 private \norganisations through centralised training. In these committees, Sanhita does not represent as external \nmembers. \nAs a result of Sanhita\u2019s role as a support group and advisor, the following outcomes could be \nachieved. \nIn two complaints from two different eminent Universities, Sanhita provided legal advice and \ncounselling support to the aggrieved persons who approached the organisation directly. \nA group of engineering students (both female & male) lodged a mass complaint against one of the \nfaculty members to the IC of their university. The complainants also approached media houses. \nSanhita assisted the senior journalists from a renowned media house who reached out to Sanhita in \norder to understand the ethics and strategy of reporting the mass complaint on SHW. \n \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nReaching out to women workers \nThe employers are reluctant to give access to the casual, unorganised and marginal workers within \ntheir organisations. When it comes to ensuring safe workplaces for women employees, the \n \nOak Progress Report.    8 \nemployers accountability extends to only women working in offices. Though the industries are \ndependent on the women workers in their factories, mills and plantations these women don\u2019t exist \nin their policies and there is no eagerness to change the status quo of this invisibility. The only way \nfor Sanhita to access the women workers is through strategic partnerships with trade unions \nworking with them or with NGO which are either directly working with them or working with the \ncommunities that they are part of. \nIt has been rather challenging to raise the issue of sexual harassment in such public forum which is \na first of its kind experience for the mill workers. \nWorking with the Unions \nThe unions being patriarchal structures are not too keen to work with feminist/women\u2019s groups. They \nare also weary of NGOs in general and are skeptical about what results a collaboration can yield. \nSanhita\u2019s strategic partnership with Nagarik Mancha and its persistent endeavours helped in not only \nbreaking the ice with the unions but also bringing different unions together on a common platform. \nWorking closely with the unions, Sanhita was able to reach the women workers. \n  \nCrisis Intervention \nExperiences of Complainants \nAlmost all complainants have been experiencing \u2018Character assassination\u2019, \u2018humiliation\u2019 and \u2018hostile \nwork environment\u2019 irrespective of their designation, employment status & work sector. \nSanhita experiences the following concern areas in dealing SHW complaints as a support group & \nadvisor: \nChallenges in following Inquiry Procedure  \nIn most of the cases, Sanhita experienced lack of technical knowhow about inquiry procedure among \nIC members. ICs where Sanhita is not the External member were also unaware about the SHW issue. \nKnowledge Gap among Aggrieved \nSanhita noted a knowledge gap among students who approached Sanhita for legal advice and \ncounseling support. The engineering students were definitely empowered, but, were found to be \nlacking even in basic information about their rights laid down in the 2013 Act. They also did not have \nany understanding about how to deal with such harassment.  \nICs not Equipped \nIn two complaints, where Sanhita has played a support role, the ICs were not equipped enough to \nhandle the complaints. Sanhita identified the gaps in Technical knowledge, like process of inquiry, \nservice  rules of the organization, legal aspects etc and also found lacunae in documentation \nprocess. As a result of this, the aggrieved faced hostility from their ICs. \nNon-cooperative Authority /Administration \nAggrieved also faced non-cooperation from the Authority/Administration in both the education \ninstitutes. \n \n \n \n7.3.a. Objective 3 Objective \nTo enhance the organisational capacity for better project management, improved measurement of \noutcomes and diversifying the fund base   \n \n \nOak Progress Report.    9 \n \n \n7.3.b. Objective 3 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nBeing part of the process of developing the Theory of Change for the Oaks Country Programme was \na great learning experience for Team Sanhita. It helped the team understand the gaps in the \nMonitoring, Evaluation and Learning approaches within the organisation. The proposed approach, \nstrategies and interventions in the Tea Gardens were reviewed, fine-tuned, and sharpened during the \nTOC development process. \nSanhita\u2019s Organisational ToC is in place: Following this Sanhita also developed an organisational \nTOC with the help of NIITI Consulting. This helped the team in structuring and streamlining all \naspects of the work and in clearly defining expected outputs and outcomes. Sanhita\u2019s projects have \nbecome more outcome oriented. \nSanhita has also arrived at a template for its work through which it is able to simultaneously achieve \nall the following results: \n\u2022 Reach out to women workers directly and hear their voices and concerns. \n\u2022 Implement interventions on a Pilot basis and evaluate outcomes. \n\u2022 Document outcomes, progress and learnings and disseminate it with key stakeholders as well \nas a wider audience. \n\u2022 Share all of the above and continue its evidence-based advocacy with relevant stakeholders. \nIn keeping with its commitment to expand its fund base, Sanhita had secured a second funding from \nPaul Hamlin Foundation (PHF). This project has successfully completed its first cycle of one year \nnine months following which there was an external evaluation. On the basis of the recommendations \nof the evaluation they have agreed to continue the support for another two years. Under the PHF \nsupport, Sanhita will reach out and closely work with marginal/frontline workers of Government \nDepartment on the issue of safe workplaces. This is also a first of its kind initiative. \nIn response to the increased projects, Sanhita\u2019s core team has also expanded with the addition of one \nmore member. \nCurrently efforts are underway to secure another additional funding from within the country. \nSanhita\u2019s FundRaising Strategy Paper is in place \nThe strategy paper for 2022 \u2013 2025 outlines Sanhita\u2019s Funding Needs, Strategies and Challenges to \nput the organisation on a sustainable long-term financial footing so that it will be able to deliver on \nits objective of creating safe workplaces for women workers across sectors. \nIn the financial year 2023-2024, Sanhita\u2019s total Annual Budget is INR 70 Lakhs. Considering the \norganisational capacity and the programmatic needs, Sanhita sets the maximum limit of the \norganisational annual budget i.e. INR 90 Lakhs in the coming financial years. \nSanhita has been adopted multiple strategies for fundraising such as exploring the contacts with \ninternational and national level donor agencies/organisations who would support work in the area of \nsafety of women workers, developing partnership with select government departments, private \norganisations, employers\u2019 associations, NGOs, trade unions or education institutes who are willing \nto sponsor or share costs of training  programmes and planning to collaborate with the organisations \nat national level involved in research related to women workers\u2019 issue where Sanhita can bring its \ntechnical expertise and domain knowledge of sexual harassment at workplace.  (Strategy Paper is \nattached as Annexure) \n \nOak Progress Report.    10 \nMajor Outcome \nIn the second cycle, Sanhita approached the Paul Hamlyn Foundation with an innovative and \nchallenging proposal of working directly with Anganwadi Workers in two districts of West Bengal. \nIn addition, Sanhita will do advocacy with the monitoring and relevant government departments for \ncreating safe workplaces for frontline workers. The Paul Hamlyn Foundation is supporting this new \ndomain of Sanhita\u2019s work for the next two years (April, 2023 \u2013 March, 2025).  \nIn the past one year, Sanhita has established the programme specific partnership with Department \nof Panchayat & Rural Development, Indian Jute Mill Association and an NGO named Nari O Sishu \nKalyan Kendra for different initiatives.   \n \n \n \n7.3.c. Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n\u2022 The issue of safe workplaces and rights of women workers not the priority of the CSR \n(Corporate Social Responsibility) \n\u2022 The scope of Sanhita\u2019s work has a limited funding opportunities, a very few donor could be \nidentified who would be interested to support issue of SHW and rights of women workers \n\u2022 It is difficult to raise support for this kind of work which does not have quick tangible \noutcomes. The issue moreover is tied to workplace dynamics and the \nemployers/organisations among other stakeholders hesitate to support the cause as this \nmight lead to clash of interest  \n\u2022 Sanhita does not encourage online donation from the individuals/associations in the context \nof stringent FC & IT rules & regulations \n\u2022 Sanhita has been receiving requests to conduct training from public sector, central \ngovernment, private organisations, NGOs and state government departments. But some state \ngovernment departments and private organisations offer no or a very nominal amount of \nfacilitation fees. But for strategic reason and visibility, Sanhita accepts such offer from some \nimportant government departments. Sometimes it becomes difficult to select organisations \nand balance between the visibility & fund generation.    \n         Being a small organisation with limited human resources, it is often challenging to balance \nbetween the existing project commitments and training assignments against fees as part of the \nfundraising.  \n \n \n8.", "Significant changes": "Significant changes.

Objective 1 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nChangemakers Program in Assam: \nThe Changemakers Program was launched in Assam in April 2022 by Nazdeek\u2019s grantee partner, \nPAJHRA. The purpose was to support 14 Adivasi youth to build knowledge and capacity towards \nholistic leadership skills. They were provided 6 in-person residential trainings, 2.5 days long each, \ncovering sessions on (1) culture, history and society, (2) civic education, and (3) skills such as \nresearch, writing and reporting. Each training was followed by supervised field work in communities, \nwherein the participants conducted Focus Group Discussions, Individual structured interviews and \nsubmitted 4 reports per participant in the duration of the Program. Each of the reports were a part of \ntheir homework, which involved field work on a selected issue (such as the Public Distribution \nSystem or Anganwadi) and then preparing a report to document the activity and analyse the results. \nTo culminate the program, 08 of the fellows were taken on an Exposure Visit where they visited \nhistorical monuments and interacted with organisations such as DISHA, Durbar, and Jana Sanghati \nKendra. The idea behind the visit was to provide a chance to these Adivasi youths hailing from remote \nplantations and with limited opportunities for travel and urban exposure to learn about metropolitan \nlifestyles, Indian art and history, and to gain a wider understanding of socio-economic issues and \nCSO based interventions outside the plantations space and with demographies other than Adivasis. \nOf the 14 participants, 09 were women and 05 were men; most hailing from a social work and legal \neducation background. The syllabus, pedagogy, design and monitoring, and selection process was \ndeveloped under the guidance of subject matter experts such as Prof. Virginius Xaxa. For each \nsession, training modules (15 in total) were created. \nIn terms of the progress in achieving Objective 1, as the first in a three-year process, this Program \nwas successful. Based on the skills mapping and expectation analysis conducted with the cohort, it is \nevident that they increased, and in certain subjects acquired first time knowledge, on matters of Indian \ngovernance structure, entitlements on health, food, labour, grievance redressal systems, information \napplications, issues-stakeholder-risk analysis, desk and field research and writing. Significantly, as is \nalso reflected in the Most Significant Change stories attached herewith, they developed and \nstrengthened critical thinking, public speaking, networking and outreach skills and grew \ndemonstrably in confidence and self-respect. Motivated by the learnings, participants from the \nprogram have gone on to work as Accredited Social Healthcare Activists in tea plantations, gender \ncommittee President of tea worker women\u2019s collectives, while some are conducting independent \nresearch on Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme for tea workers, have enrolled in graduate level Labour \nEconomic courses, and have become more active as members of workers\u2019 collectives. In various \nfeedback sessions, the participants have shown a keenness to work within their community and on \nissues concerning tea workers at large in their professional or individual capacity, as feasible. \nOther Capacity Building Activities, Community Consultations, Meeting with line departments: \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \nApproximately 34 capacity building, trainings of trainers, and community consultations were carried \nout by PAJHRA, with technical support from Nazdeek. Out of these, 04 offline and 03 online \nconsultations were held to study the new labour regime and state rules, and formal comments thereto \nwere submitted to the Labour Welfare Department, Assam. To commensurate the efforts, 07 meetings \nwere held with government line departments (E.g. District offices of National Health Mission, \nDepartment of Health & Family Welfare, Social Welfare, Gaon Panchayat and local Police Units; \nState level Directorate of Social Welfare and NHM Headquarters) on issues connected with maternal \nhealth and maternity benefits, ration, sexual harassment at workplace, tea garden hospitals by \ncommunity members and women collective\u2019s representatives. \nThe participants of the listed exercises included PAJHRA staff and volunteers, women and student \ncollective\u2019s leaders and women community members. Through this process of knowledge sharing \non entitlements, recording ongoing issues and grievances, identifying redressal strategies, and \nsharing the same with communities, PAJHRA staff, volunteers, and women collective leaders were \nnot only able to enhance their \nown understanding of entitlements and grievance redressal mechanisms (helpline numbers, postal \ncomplaints and in-person complaints submission directed primarily towards ration services, \nhealthcare including maternal and child, Anganwadi system), they were also alongside able to \nstrengthen and expand their rapport with communities. For the communities, at this stage of the \nproject, it led to an increased awareness of their entitlements, approaches and processes to access \nthem and filing grievances, and learning through direct demonstration by guided visits/helpline calls \nto authorities for filing complaints, advocacy, and seeking information from the authorities.  In \nDibrugarh for instance, PAJHRA\u2019s field educators organised community meetings with Aanganwadi \nWorkers (AWWs) and ASHA workers for pregnant and lactating women, where the latter filed their \ngrievances before the AWCs, shared their mutual challenges\u2014especially those related to \ndocumentation and form filling. As a follow up, they persuaded the ASHA to accompany them to \ntheir sub-center to review the status of their maternity cash entitlement applications as per official \nrecords, submit additional documents, and file complaints over non-payment of cash installments. \nFollowing this, of the 10 partcipants, 3 received partial instalments, 2 full instalments, and the \nremaining were able to submit necessary documents. Some of the other key impacts observed \nincluded formation of unit committees of the women\u2019s collective in Dibrugarh, Nagaon, and Golaghat \nDistricts, and initiatives taken by women community members and collective\u2019s leaders to address \ntheir grievances, especially those related to pregnant and lactating women, through meetings with \ngovernment representatives. For instance, in a community meeting held in Duliajan (Dibrugarh), 28 \nwomen community members identified inadequate food, nutrition, clothing and shelter, expensive \nand inadequate medical services, poor and inaccessible education as main issues plaguing the tea \nplantation workers. They were aided in the issue identification process by PAJHRA\u2019s field educator \nand by the local ASHA, AWWs, AWW helpers, and Auxiliary Nursing Midwife (ANM) who had \nespecially been invited as government representatives to this meeting for information exchange, \nadvocacy, and grievance resolution purposes. The community members discussed best options for \ntheir advocacy on the identified issues and decided to tackle them by way of collectives. The \ncollectives\u2019 leaders (who were also present in the meeting) explanation of the purpose, process, and \nimpact of women\u2019s collectives played an important role in this decision. They observed that \ncollectives\u2019 strength and resources were necessary to support them in elevating their grievances to \nthe government office bearers. Thus, they collectively decided to form a unit committee of the \ncollective at Duliajan Gaon Panchayat and a regional committee at Duliajan. \nScoping for local partner organisations: \nDuring the reporting period, Nazdeek engaged in scoping for partner organisations in Assam and \nhas identified 3 potential partners, including one in the Barak Valley. Owing to the prevailing \nsituation, the progress on this activity has been gradual with great emphasis on financial and legal \ndue diligence. We are also conferring with experts, current local partner organisations and \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \ncollectives to help us identify the way forward in Assam. Nazdeek intends to complete the \nreassessment and reorientation of its Assam engagement by the end of this year. \n  \n \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nThe current legal and policy conditions have been the primary challenge during the reporting period. \nIncreasing threats to human rights defenders have also affected the pace and depth of work. The \nsuspension of PAJHRA\u2019s FCRA certificate in October affected program activities in the last quarter \nof the project. While Nazdeek was able to ensure completion of the Changemakers program through \nanother grantee, the other remaining activity (exposure visit for women collective members) was \nwithdrawn from the project as it was considered neither prudent nor feasible to conduct the same. \nDespite the above situation, it may be noted that Nazdeek was able to accomplish all activities \ncommitted to by it in year 1 of the grant. \nWith the continued suspension of PAJHRA\u2019s FCRA certificate, Nazdeek is currently reassessing its \nstrategy in Assam, in consultation with relevant experts and the Oak Foundation. \nAt the grantee\u2019s level, a program at the scale of the Changemakers program was novel to them and \nserved as a sharp learning curve for their team. They experienced logistical and coordination \nchallenges in the initial part of the program. As expertise on certain subjects is limited within the \ncommunity, they initially struggled to identify resource persons. But with Nazdeek\u2019s technical \nguidance and support from experts based outside of Assam, they were able to overcome these issues \nduring the 2nd quarter of the project. \nEnsuring women community members\u2019 participation in community and collective activities, \nespecially in new project areas was also a challenge faced by the grantee. In order to overcome the \nsame, the grantee staff engaged in dedicated outreach and rapport building and also utilised the \nsupport of women collective\u2019s leaders. \n  \n \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective \nEnhance capacity of local civil society organisations in Barak Valley to bring greater access to \nsocio-economic rights to tea plantation workers (timeframe: 3 years). \n \n  \n \n \n \n7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \n \nOak Progress Report.    5 \nNazdeek, as per the year one commitment, engaged in scoping for a partner in Barak Valley. We \nconducted this activity through consultations with our existing partners and networks, subject \nmatter experts, community collectives active in the region to build a list of potential partners. In \npursuance of the same, we visited an organisation in Barak Valley, interacted with their Director \nand Board Member, office staff to better understand their approach and current work. We are also \nexploring possibilities of our current partners being able to support us in activities in the Barak \nValley. Due to the ongoing situation, Nazdeek is doing careful considerations in legal and financial \ncompliances and making gradual progress on this objective. Nazdeek intends to complete the \nreassessment and reorientation of its Assam engagement by the end of this year, and this will \ninclude the finalisation of a partner for the Barak Valley part of the project, if the new engagement \nplan allows the same. \n \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nAs mentioned earlier, the current legal and policy conditions have forced us to take a measured \napproach towards this objective in Year 1. We are following the advice of financial and legal \ncompliance experts in the matter and for now intend to continue our scoping activity in Year two. \n \n \n \n7.3.a. Objective 3 Objective \nEnhance capacity of local civil society organisations through training of trainers in West \nBengal to bring greater access to socio-economic rights to tea plantation \nworkers (timeframe: 3 years). \n \n \n \n7.3.b. Objective 3 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nAs this is Nazdeek\u2019s first grantee-based initiative in West Bengal, this Objective and especially the \nactivities in Year 1, were crafted to combine scoping and baseline studies on tea workers issues in \nNorth Bengal and a need-based training of trainers (ToT) model for the grantee. After an initial \nbaseline study (attached herewith) conducted in 9 tea plantations, focusing on issues and context \nmapping, our grantee BMJ with Nazdeek\u2019s technical support, was able to (1) identify ToT topics \nand design, (2) select Cha Sundari Scheme (a tea workers\u2019 housing scheme launched by WB \ngovernment in 2022) for field research and report writing, (3) identify line departments for \nconsultations, and (4) identify topics for filing Right to Information (RTI) applications where \nofficial guidelines and data was required for any further activities. \nBased on the above, 4 ToTs were conducted on Indian Governance and Legal structures for \nentitlements; Right to Information; Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace; and on Anti-\nGender Discrimination. The participants for these trainings included consultants associated with \ngrantee, community members, and leaders of community collectives. 4 training modules were also \n \nOak Progress Report.    6 \ndeveloped for the purpose of the ToTs. These trainings allowed for systematic knowledge sharing, \nwhich was further transferred to communities via community meetings by the participants. The \ntrainings also helped the grantee in assessing the current levels of knowledge on issues and policies \namong community leaders and members, and in further refining the project. The training \nparticipants, especially after the trainings on sexual harassment and gender discrimination, resolved \nto (a) be more vigilant of such cases in their plantations and to record and track the same, (b) \nconduct awareness exercises with the community, especially women and their families, (c) use \nstrategies such as RTI filing and engagement with plantation management and local officials over \nnon-compliance with the POSH Act. \nFurther, at least 120 community consultations were carried out by the grantee across 30 plantations. \nTopics ranged from the need to collectivize on common issues, formulating workers\u2019 claims\u2014\nespecially for gratuity and provident fund\u2014available grievance redressal mechanisms, maternity \nbenefits and entitlements, prevention of harassment at the workplace and reporting mechanisms, \netc. These consultations enhanced the workers and the communities understanding of their issues \nand how they must be understood, how to identify and utilize available resources, and a clearer \nknowledge of utilization of policies and systems pertaining to their work. \nFollowing the trainings, 5 RTIs were filed by the training participants and grantee consultants on \nthe Cha Sundari scheme. 4 meetings were conducted by the Grantee, workers collective\u2019s leaders, \nand local legal experts with relevant officials from the Housing and Labour Departments to \nunderstand the technicalities of Cha Sundari scheme and the progress in drafting of rules to the new \nlabour codes by the West Bengal government. The RTI responses and information received through \nmeetings contributed in the development of the Cha Sundari Report that was launched in \nJanuary 2023. This report is to be utilized for generating scheme related awareness among \ncommunity members and to help them draft and establish claims thereunder. As the report states, \nthere is ambiguity at the policy level for this scheme and the grantee intends to engage with the \nrelevant authorities to clarify the same and advocate for changes where required. \nFurther, as an impact of the meetings with the line departments, the grantee was invited to prepare \ndraft rules on labour codes and submit the same to them in order to support the government\u2019s own \ndrafting process. With technical support from Nazdeek, the grantee developed and submitted draft \nrules on (1) Industrial Relations Code and the Occupational Safety, Health, and Working \nConditions Code and (2) a summary of on the remaining two codes and (3) state amendment \nrecommendations for all 04 codes. These were submitted to the Office of the Deputy Labour \nCommissioner, Alipurduar. In year two, the grantee intends to continue engagement with the \ngovernment departments in the drafting and finalization of these rules which will have a wide-\nranging impact on tea workers\u2019 status and entitlements.   \n \n \n \n7.3.c. Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nThe challenges faced during Year 01 were: \n1. Difficulty in maintaining a steady and consistent cohort. The remoteness of the \nplantations, limited transport options, and the loss of a day\u2019s wage for participants in order to \nattend the trainings posed a challenge for the grantee. This was especially an obstacle in \nparticipation of women. As a consequence, most trainings had to be held on weekends and \nintensive planning had to be undertaken for arranging the logistics and ensuring attendance. \nFor the Year two, a process similar to Changemakers\u2019 program is being considered to maintain \nconsistency of participation.    \n \nOak Progress Report.    7 \n2. Challenges in financial coordination. As the project area and head office of the grantee were \nnot close and the latter itself was based in a small town, it became a challenge for the staff \nand consultants to coordinate on financial matters, for example submission of bills and \nreceipts had to be undertaken manually and the regularity of the same was affected. Owing to \nthis challenge, it was decided by Nazdeek to identify a more suitable grantee. Thus, Durbar \nhas been selected and we are currently conducting its financial due diligence.    \n \n \n \n7.4.a. Objective 4 Objective \nEnhance national-level advocacy on labour laws and business and human rights (timeframe: \n3 years). \n \n \n \n7.4.b. Objective 4 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nIn year 01 of the grant period, Nazdeek facilitated three consultations on draft rules to the four labour \ncodes, as issued by the Assam government. Representatives of Assam tea workers, civil society \norganisations, student and women\u2019s collectives participated in these discussions. This activity was \nundertaken under the aegis of the Assam chapter of the Forum for Rights of Tea Workers and \ncomments to all 04 draft rules were submitted. As the draft rules published by the Assam government \nwere not given wide publicity and the deadline for comments submission was unlawfully short, this \ngroup, in a meeting with the Principal Secretary, Labour Department sought an extension of the \ndeadline and also translation of the same into Assamese (official language of Assam) to ensure \nwidespread accessibility. As an impact of the meeting, the deadline for the submission of the \ncomments was extended by almost 2 months. \nAt the national level, Nazdeek provided strategic and technical support to its West Bengal grantee in \ntheir advocacy in favour of workers\u2019 claims before Justice Sapre Committee. This is a one-man \ncommittee instituted by the Supreme Court of India to assess claims for workers\u2019 dues in closed and \nsick tea plantations in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. Through our network, we \nsupported the grantee in connecting with workers and petitioners in Assam, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu \nand in assessing the ground realities. This was especially the case between our West Bengal and \nTamil Nadu partners, and our Assam and West Bengal partners who were able to meet and discuss \nstrategies towards collaborative advocacy for the coming years. The impact of these activities is \nvisible in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent order directing payment of Rs. 650 crores to 25 tea plantations\u2019 \nworkers in Assam as their legal and rightful dues, where partnerships between our grantees/partners \nplayed a crucial role in securing the workers\u2019 claims.         \n \n \n \n7.4.c. Objective 4 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n \nOak Progress Report.    8 \nThe main challenge to attaining this objective has been the legal and policy climate around tea \nindustry and consequent impact on the civil society spaces. We and our partners are making careful \nconsiderations to work in full compliance with the laws of the land. \nThe delay in the enforcement of the new central codes, and in the formulation of rules thereunder by \nthe central and state governments has also affected our plans of national-level legislative advocacy. \nIrrespective, all our grantees and partners are in the meantime dedicated to ensuring that vast majority \nof our communities have an understanding of these laws and their implications, so that we are able \nto ensure their participation in the legislative drafting process once it resumes. We continue to seek \ncommon ground and initiatives for the fulfillment of this grant objective on other issues as well. \n \n \n \n7.5.a. Objective 5 Objective \nStrengthen civil society in the regional and global tea sectors (timeframe: 3 years). \n \n  \n \n \n \n7.5.b. Objective 5 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nDuring year 01 of the grant period, Nazdeek conducted 3 scoping visits within South Asia, with 01 \neach in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The purpose of these visits was to meet with potential \npartners, understand their work and our mutual synergies, as well as to conduct initial scoping visits \nin tea plantations to acquaint ourselves with country-specific contexts and status of tea workers within \nthe industry and the legal regime. In each of these countries, we also met workers and their \nrepresentatives and received information on the current collective bargaining norms and processes in \nplace. In Nepal, we conducted meetings with 3 organisations (2 in Kathmandu, 1 in Jhapa) and visted \n3 tea plantations; in Bangladesh, we met with 2 organisations, one of whom is an existing grantee, \nand visited 3 tea plantations; in Sri Lanka, we met with 2 organisations and visited 2 tea plantations. \nAt this stage, in Bangladesh we have identified a partner organisation and are in the process of \nassessing others in Nepal and Sri Lanka. \nIn order to strengthen intra-regional understanding, cooperation, and development of a common \ndemand of tea workers, their representatives and concerned CSOs, the inaugural session of the South \nAsia chapter of Forum for Rights of Tea Workers (FRTW-SA) was organised in Sri Lanka on May \n21, 2023. The participants hailed from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia (observer). \nThe day-long discussion saw the participants provide updates on the most pressing workers\u2019 issues \nin their regions and identified common factors and impacts at an intra-regional level. The issues \nidentified were non-fixation of minim wages and dilution of collective bargain power within the \nregion, the increasing informalization of the tea work with the rise of small tea growers, women\u2019s \nsocio-economic status and low representation despite being the majority tea workers, and lack of \nhousing title for tea workers across the region. The participants, as next steps, agreed to have (1) a \n2nd session of FRTW-SA early next year to discuss coalition structure and standard; (2) engage in \nbilateral collaborations and comparative studies on tea workers and entitlements to enhance mutual \nunderstanding and areas of cooperation. Further, the participants were also able to attend the \nMalaiyagam event commemorating 200 years of tea and migration/employment of Tamil workers in \n \nOak Progress Report.    9 \nup-country plantations in Sri Lanka. This event served as an opportunity for us to gain a deeper \nunderstanding of the challenges and aspirations of the tea workers community in Sri Lanka and \nallowed us to meet their representatives and relevant experts. We were also able to contribute to the \ndrafting of the final Declaration of the Malaiyagam, especially on points of women workers\u2019 \nentitlements, housing and land, and on collective bargaining processes. \n \n \n \n7.5.c. Objective 5 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nThe primary challenges faced were: \n1. In Nepal, as our desk and field research revealed, there are no organisations helmed by \nworkers or otherwise, that are working specifically and directly on the entitlements of tea \nworkers. There are unions that are active but they carry strong political party affiliations. \nKeeping the above in mind, we are looking to first develop knowledge partnerships with \norganisations that work on socio-economic issues with similar demographies and build \nrapport with workers\u2019 representatives, especially women. \n2. The organisation of FRTW-SA posed unique challenges in terms of legal technicalities and \nlogistics in a foreign country. We had to spend considerable organisational time and effort in \nunderstanding the legal complexities involved and in arranging travel partners for logistical \npurposes. \n \n \n8.", "Significant changes": "Significant changes. If applicable and not addressed in the challenges and obstacles question for a particular \nobjective, please state any changes that occurred over the last grant period affecting grant terms and goal delivery (i.e., key \nstaffing, leadership, timeline or organisational structural changes).   \n* Please note that financial-oriented updates (i.e., actual funding received, funding spend-down changes) should be \ncommented on within the Oak Budget to Actuals Report. \nThis reporting period has been challenging for a number of reasons. Some of them are as follows: \n\u2022 Political, Legislative, and Civil Challenges: Due to the ongoing political, legislative, and \ncivil instability within the country, we and our partners have been experiencing heightened \npressures and have had to scale back on work to address the current challenges. While \ncontinuing to support projects and grantee organizations, we have in the last few months \nfocused towards strengthening our communication and data policies, revamping and updating \nour data security systems, and collaborating with area experts to ensure security of our \nconsultants and partners. Due to the probable risks being faced by community-led \norganizations that are associated in different capacities, we are undertaking new ways of doing \nour work to ensure the safety of all parties involved. \n\u2022 Organizational Restructuring: In light of the current circumstances and long-term goals of \nthe organization, Nazdeek has chosen to undergo a phase of organizational restructuring. We \nhave been undertaking workshops, sessions, and consultations on issues related to \nsafeguarding, risk mitigation, communications strategy, and much more. As the organization \nand the consultants work through this transition, including introduction of new consultants, \neveryone is learning to adapt to the new systems and methods of work. Despite these \nchallenges, Nazdeek is looking forward to this year as we embark on more scoping visits, \nsupport grantees in conducting robust workshops, and provide enhanced technical and \nresearch advisory for grantees and communities to utilize. It is expected that this transitional \n \nOak Progress Report.    10 \nphase will come to a successful closure this year and the organization will be able to continue \nits work even more impactfully through its new form. \n\u2022 Grantee Change for Cycle 2 of the Grant: it was observed by Nazdeek that the distance \nbetween project areas and the grantee\u2019s headquarters had led to accounting, coordination, and \nreporting challenges for the grantee and its field workers under the project. Thus, Nazdeek \nrequested for a change of grantee from Bolpur Manab Jameen to Durbar Mahila Samanwaya \nCommittee. As Nazdeek had had the opportunity to meet with Durbar\u2019s leadership and staff \nand to understand their work, and also had the experience of working with them as a funder \nfor a short grant, Durbar was selected as the grantee for West Bengal leg of the project in \nCycle 2 of the grant. This change was also requested to the Oak Foundation and was approved \nby them. At this point, Durbar\u2019s financial due diligence has been completed and we have \nreceived our CA\u2019s approval to go ahead with the organisation as a grantee. \n\u2022 No-cost extensions: Nazdeek had sought and received 2 no-cost extensions from the Oak \nFoundation. The first was to complete the final remaining activity under the Assam leg of the \nproject, for conducting financial due-diligence of Durbar, and for Nazdeek\u2019s audit to be \ncompleted. As the auditors in US were not able to complete the process, we had to seek \nanother no-cost extension. \n \n \n9.

Village Coordination Groups (VCGs) are formed with the existing Government committee (PRI, SHG, Mothers committee, ASHA workers, school management committee etc.) members to make the institutions effective and avail government schemes and entitlements. There\u2019s no overlap of members between TFSCs and VCGs. Though, it was proposed to establish 25 TFSCs in each village but in some villages the habitations were too far from the main village (more than 3 kms.) and it was decided to have additional TFSCs. So, 28 TFSCs were formed. Total 123 monthly TFSC meetings have been conducted as on August 2023 to discuss about the issues pertaining to agriculture and livelihoods in their respective habitations. \nSimilarly, to avail government schemes and entitlements, Village Coordination Groups (VCGs) are formed in 37 habitations spread across Bankura and North 24 Parganas. Out of 89 VCG members in Sandheshkhali \u2013 1, 68 members are female and in Ranibandh, 76 members are female out of 250 total VCG members. \nThrough VCGs, awareness meetings and orientations were organized on various existing government schemes like Kanyashree, Rupashree, Swasthya Sathi and Krishak Bandhu, among others. During these meetings, VCG members/community members are also trained on how to file petitions for both individual as well as community needs.  \nThe efforts of our VCG members and field staff have resulted in sanctioning of 15 individual entitlements (ST certificate) out of total 266 petitions submitted to Boyarmari \u2013 I Gram Panchayat under Sandeshkhali \u2013 I Block, North 24 Parganas. In Ranibandh, 118 (individual as well as community) petitions are submitted to Duare Sarkar and the petitions are yet to be sanctioned.", "Project Objective 2: Promoting agro-ecological practices, crop diversification and water resource development for food & nutritional security": ".\nEstablishment of Demo-Plots\nTo promote agro-ecological practices amongst the farmers of Ranibandh block, 33 demo-plots are established out of which 24 are in Barikul GP and the rest are in Ranibandh GP. Out of 33 demo plots, 24 demo plots are established to promote vegetable crops such as cauliflower, pumpkin, cabbage, radish, tomato, bitter gourd, ridge gourd, bean etc. by following agro-ecological practices. Demo plots are owned by the farmers and are in the range of 1 \u2013 1.5 bighas of land. The demo plots are our farmer field schools (FFS) where the progressive/interested farmers are brought for exposure and training on the agro-ecological practices. 9 plots were established to demonstrate the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) method.\nTable: Details of Farmer Field Schools (FFS) conducted \n\nTotal 45 FFS are conducted in our project location under Ranibandh block, out of which 13 FFS were conducted under Ranibandh GP and 32 FFS under Barikul GP. Total 518 farmers including 53 women farmers have attended the FFS where the farmers are trained on different package of practices (POPs) for crops. \nThrough FFS, the farmers are also trained on preparing organic pesticides and fertilisers, land preparation, seed treatment, seed sowing techniques, weed control and pest management. FFS is an avenue to learn new knowledge related to agriculture that involves participatory process where farmers learn by doing under the able guidance of our field staff and experts. Liaising with PRIs and other line departments are done through regular sharing of information and meetings. The team members sought the advice of ADA on pest management in pumpkin and also on availing seeds. As the department is distributing only high yielding seeds and not indigenous, they were procured from outside. \nAgriculture Implements\nTable: Agriculture Implement Given to TFSCs in Ranibandh\n\nFarmers to ease the burden and reduce the time spent on threshing wanted to procure paddle paddy thresher, weeder and battery sprayer to increase the productivity. TFSCs procured Paddle Paddy Thresher (28), Cono Weeder (28), Battery Sprayer (6 and the remaining TFSCs will be provided soon) and Drums (56).  \nPromotion of Pulses, Oilseeds and Vegetables \nDuring the Kharif season, 619 farmers received vegetable seed (cabbage, pumpkin, okra, horse gram, tomato etc.) support as part of promoting vegetables amongst the tribal farmers\nSimilarly, during the Rabi season, 26 farmers received mustard seeds of 1 kg on an average out of which the total mustard seed production was 597 kgs. Further, 59 farmers received support to promote kitchen garden. \nThe farmers use high yielding variety of seeds in paddy and indigenous seeds for other crops. The shift to natural farming is a gradual process and so the gradation of change process is followed in CPF. In the initial phase, with few agro-ecological practices are promoted. Farmers are trained and encouraged to apply organic fertilizers (Ghanjeevamritam and Jeevamritam) and organic pesticides (Neemastram and Agniastram). The farmers treat the seeds before sowing by following the process of Beejamritam. \nCapacitating Maintenance of Watershed Structures \nThough the area receives good rainfall, the water is not being retained as the watershed structures constructed by government are not functional. So, the farmers are being given trainings on the maintenance of watershed structures. \n13 watershed structures were identified for repair and maintenance. 1 water tank was desilted in Parashiya village (Barikul GP) with the project cost of Rs.1.38 lakh and farmers contribution were Rs. 12,000. Around, 180 farmers did Shramdan for 5 days. CPFs intervention had a ripple effect and the communities desilted another tank on their own. Further, they also repaired a check dam by contributing Rs.12000/-. \nSoil Test \nTo introduce the scientific method of understanding the soil, the farmers were trained on undertaking soil tests. Soil samples were sent for testing to KVK Sonamukhi, Bankura. In the first batch, soil samples of 121 farmers were sent and the result indicated that most of the soil contains high acidic content. The results and recommendations are shared with the farmers to improve the soil health. For instance, if the NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium) content is low, the farmers are advised to increase the NPK by applying vermicompost, farm yard manure and green manure.  \nAnother batch of 107 Soil samples have been collected from the farmers and sent for testing. The results are yet to come.", "Project Objective 3: Enhancing access to alternative livelihoods among landless, resource poor and other forest dependent communities": ".\nAs majority of the communities (70%) are dependent upon Non-Timber Forest Produces (NTFPs) for additional incomes, it is imperative that the communities are made aware about the importance of forest and their conservation. Towards this end, CPF has conducted 5 trainings on sustainable harvesting of NTFPs and value addition. \n\nLocal experts and forest department officials were involved as resource persons to provide awareness to the NTFP collectors of our project villages. NTFP collectors were informed about the negative impacts of over harvesting of NTFPs and the need for value addition (leaf plate making, pickles etc.) to fetch more incomes. As far as marketing of the NTFPs are concerned, the project staff has explored different options by speaking and consulting number of persons/organizations such as the DFO of Bankura South Division, Ranibandh Range Officer, PRADAN, traders and NTFP collectors themselves. Two of our community field facilitators (CFFs) were trained on leaflet making and are aware of markets linkages. So, CPF is exploring to reestablish the market linkages through them and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in each GP under Ranibandh Block for the marketing of NTFPs. As suggested, TRIFED option also will be explored. \nTo enhance the income of landless, resource poor and single headed households, backyard poultry farming has been promoted. 42 community members from Ranibandh and Barikul were provided with poultry of local breed (3 each). \nAwareness meetings on Forest Rights Act (FRA-2006) are being conducted at the village level to make them aware about the Community Forest Rights (CFR) and the claim process. CPF has built rapport and collaborated with the Forest Department in plantation and value addition of NTFPs. The SDLC through Block Land Records Office (BLRO)/BDO has distributed IFR titles few years ago but in our operational areas no CFR titles have been submitted. The West Bengal Tribal Development Portal mentions that in Bankura district 210 CFRs have been distributed (https://adibasikalyan.gov.in/forest-right-act ) and we are trying to know where these titles are given. In the next year, we are planning to submit CFR claims in our villages after the formation of Forest Rights Committees (FRCs).", "Project Objective 4: Enabling project communities to access and avail their constitutional rights and entitlements": ".\nDuring the VCG meetings (as highlighted in the 1st Objective), project communities are made aware about the existing Government services and entitlements. To build rapport between the community and the government representatives, various programs and meetings are held. The World Environment Day was celebrated at Chendhapathar village on June 5th 2023 which was participated by forest officials, local intellectuals, school children and other community members. \n\nIn collaboration with the forest department, plant saplings are distributed amongst the project communities. Plantations were carried out by TFSC members in school compounds, ICDS centres, Dam/pond bund at Parashya and few at individual agricultural plots. \n\n\n\nChallenges\nIn West Bengal, the government officials are not accepting filing of petitions on a regular basis for social security programs and entitlements and they are only accepting during the Duare Sarkar camps and they are also not being held regularly.  We have approached the Right to Food and Work Network (RTFWN) and planning to meet them at the earliest. \nIn Sandeshkhali area, the bureaucratic hurdles in getting permission to operate in villages has taken considerable time and energy. However, now in all the 12 villages, we got permission to operate.    \nIt took some time to ground the project but with persons having agriculture qualifications and experience has helped in grounding the project at faster pace. \nThis Kharif season, due to prolonged dry spell coupled with extreme heat, the vegetable crops in few villages got damaged."}}, "grant_application_form": {"GAF_Rupantaran_Foundation_AmpliCommuVoice_202311011303.pdf": {"1.

(maximum 300 \nwords):\nThere is much discrimination in our society based on economic condition, gender, \ncaste, age, educational qualification etc. We believe that being treated equally \nwith dignity is the basic thing one should expect from the society. With a vision of \na transformed society built on equity, dignity and peace Rupantaran Foundation \nwas formed in 2009 as not for profit, non-political organization. The word \n\u2018Rupantaran\u2019 literally means \u2018the process of positive transformation\u2019. As our name \nsuggests we are facilitating an empowering process of transformation towards \nequality, dignity and peace with the disadvantaged people to shape a just, \nequitable and nonviolent world. \nPresently we are directly operating in 4 blocks of Sunderbans in South 24 \nParganas district and Kolkata in West Bengal on the issues of child protection, \ngender equity, education, and livelihoods. Our aim is to build leadership, enable \nsocial justice and promote responsive citizenship among communities through \nengaging young people, women and marginalized people. Rupantaran also works \nas a resource and capacity building organisation for social partners and institutes.\n \nRupantaran Foundation is registered as a Society under West Bengal Societies \nRegistration Act XII of 1860, bearing Registration Number S/1L/60699 of 2009 \u2013 \n10.

Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\nThe financial situation of Rupantaran Foundation has been on a growing curve \nwith every passing year, especially after receiving the FCRA registration.  In \nprevious year, the annual operating costs of the organization was around 67 lakhs \nand this financial year its expected to reach 1 crore.\n \nRupantaran Foundation is grassroots implementing organisation as well as it \nserves as resource organisation. One of Rupantaran\u2019s modes of raising funds for \nits programme initiatives are to provide knowledge services to likeminded \norganizations operating in the development sector.\nAlong with that Rupantaran Foundation has good individual donors base which \nserves as a backbone and cope with shock in any sudden change in funding \ncontext e.g. recent FCRA amendment. Also, Rupantaran is supported by few \nindividuals who have provided us with Corpus Fund which will act as a reserve for \nmaintaining its core program and team. As on date, Rupantaran Foundation \ndoesn\u2019t have any outstanding debts.\n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nDespite representing a large proportion of the population, adolescent and youth are \nwidely excluded from the decision making process, as they have limited access to \ninformation, space and opportunity to acquire and share knowledge, and limited \nparticipation. In this light, Rupantaran Foundation has started its journey in 2009 \naims to create a safe space, where marginalization cease to exist, and adolescent \nand youth can build their own agency and voice their opinion. We started our \njourney from a single village in Sundarbans. Through participatory vulnerability and \ncapacities analysis and micro plan with the youth, the need for working on \neducation, prevention of early marriage and child labour etc. were pointed out as \nthe menace to be fought against. In that time, our team along with those youth \ndesigned and shaped the initial programmes of Rupantaran. Gradually, along with \nyoung people we started engaging with women and other marginalized communities \nand activating government delivery mechanisms and bodies.\n \nPast Achievements:\n\u2022Two of our youth collective members from remote villages from South 24 \nParganas received the Bravery Award, 2020 from West Bengal Commission \nfor Protection of Child Rights for their extraordinary community \ndevelopment work during pandemic.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\n \n\u2022In one of the panchayat where we did our pilot work with VLCPCs, the \nVLCPCs over the period of 3 years addressed 11 cases of trafficking, 200 \ncases of child marriage, 97 cases of dropout prevention and 70 cases of \ngender based violence (including eve teasing).\n \nA sample of 220 adolescents and youth with whom we worked reached out to 11818 \npeers, 3652 family members and 3527 community members on awareness on Child \nMarriage, Trafficking, Reproductive Health Rights, Gender equity, Education and \nOnline Safety.\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nRupantaran\u2019s key strategies are:\n1) Collectivisation and creating safe spaces for the marginalised\n2) Strengthening the local governance  \n \nWe believe that collectivizing or bringing together the marginalized people in a \nsafe space enable them to articulate their oppression and strategize for individual \nand social change. In rural areas, especially in Sundarbans there is a crunch of \nspace to engage the marginalised people in the social development processes as \nthe politics of spaces significantly plays its role in allowing and rejecting dialogues \nand discussions. For us at Rupantaran, creation of safe space was not about \ncreating a physical space rather, creating a socio-cultural and psychological space \nwhere marginalization would cease to exist, celebrates a bond of trust, encourages \nbuilding their own agency and facilitating a platform for a transformative journey \nfrom self to society.\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nThe development landscape of backward areas such as the Sundarbans points at a \nglaring dearth of people-centred processes and sustainable initiatives of change. \nWhile a number of development interventions are being implemented in the \nSundarbans, the relative degrees of participation and leadership of local \ncommunities, especially those hailing from vulnerable sections, appears to be low. \nThere seems a significant scope for assimilation of an agenda for nurturance of \npeople-centred agencies of change, for greater sustainability of interventions and \nempowerment of people\u2019s agencies.\n \nThe proposed intervention aims at addressing the non-availability of a facilitative \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nplatform for vulnerable people in the Sundarbans to come together, diagnose their \nvulnerabilities and act upon the same. Such a platform has been elusive on \naccount of high opportunity cost of participation of vulnerable groups in processes \nof development, lack of any favourable prior experiences, and increasing alienation \nfrom their core habitat and livelihoods.\n \nThe proposed thrust of the intervention, i.e. creating enabling conditions for \nspecific groups of vulnerable people in the Sundarbans to assess and act upon \ntheir vulnerabilities, is likely to pose multiple challenges to facilitating agencies. \nThe challenges were identified through the participatory vulnerabilities and \ncapacities analysis along with micro plan. This includes related to mobilisation of \nvulnerable groups amidst their day-to-day struggles, finding acceptance within the \ncommunity for a slow process of change, and potential resistance on the part of \npowerful vested interests. Internally, these include the challenge of restraint \nneeded on the part of facilitating agencies, especially at the frontline level, in \norder that they do not pre-determine the directions of the process and allow the \nsame to emerge naturally from the community level processes and perspectives of \nvulnerable groups. Other challenges relate to probable gaps in understanding and \ncommitment needed to a rights-based community-led approach to development, or \nprobable non-availability of necessary skills of facilitation at the frontline level, \namong others. \n \nThe proposed intervention offers a great opportunity for strategic leveraging of \navailable strengths of other identified organizations, towards creation of pathways \nfor emergence of people\u2019s agency for sustainable change.", "7.

(maximum 300 \nwords):\nTerre des hommes Foundation, based in Lausanne, is a member of the Terre des \nHommes International Federation, which includes sister organisations worldwide. \nIts Executive Board's role is to oversee the organisation of the Foundation and to \nmonitor ongoing activities, administration, use of the Foundation's resources, risk \nmanagement and regulation. 2019 was marked by a major financial crisis \nrequiring a reduction in the volume of expenditure in order to guarantee the \nsustainability of the organization while ensuring the continuity of operations. \nMeasures were taken to adjust priorities at the level of each programme, leading \nto the restructuring of the operational procedures of the Children in Humanitarian \nCrisis programme, which is now managed by a single Operations Department in \norder to promote coordination between emergency, rehabilitation and \ndevelopment activities; and to the termination of certain programmes (Child \nLabour Exploitation, Advocacy in Switzerland). The HQ Operations department has \nbeen restructured into 4 portfolios: Africa, MENA, Asia-South America-Europe and \nFAST (dedicated to humanitarian crisis). This new organization supports project \nimplementation in a more efficient way, without changing roles and \nresponsibilities at country level. Tdh started its work in India in 1976; the India \nDelegation Office was established in 2008 as a Liaison Office which implements its \nprogrammes and projects through local partner organisations. The office is led by \nthe Country Representative with a Team consisting of Programme Managers of the \nmain thematic areas, supported by Programme Officers and other programme and \noffice assistance staff. Strengthened by its resilience and commitment of its 2\u2019059 \nnational and expatriates\u2019 employees and volunteers worldwide, Tdh has been able \nto cope with the challenges in this exceptional context in order to maintain its \ncommitment to vulnerable children.\n6b.

Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nTdh, founded in 1960 by Edmund Kaiser in Lausanne, is a leading Swiss child \nrights organisation that was born during the Algerian conflict to provide direct \nhelp to children in need. Tdh is active in over 40 countries worldwide. In India, \nTdh has been working since 2008 in the areas of Child Protection, Mother and \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\nChild Health, WASH and Emergency Response. Tdh co-manages a Global \nSafeguarding and Support Hub, supported by UK Aid and has been awarded \n\u201cLevel 1 certification\u201d from Keeping Children Safe.\n1.PM+: In 2019, Tdh successfully rolled-out the PM+ approach, a brief \npsychological intervention for adolescents and adults (16+) in Bangladesh. \nIn keeping with WHO Mental Health Global Action Program, PM+ was \ndeveloped to manualize a brief counseling approach for mild to moderate \nmental health disorders. The approach focuses on addressing common \npsychological problems \u2013 like stress, anxiety, depression symptoms and \nwhere possible, practical problems like livelihood difficulties, family \ndiscords etc.\n2.Art-based methodology (YouCreate toolkit) for youth participation and \nsocial cohesion: The toolkit (Art-kit) has been developed by the International \nInstitute for Child Rights and Development to train youth champions and \ntheir adult allies to use various kinds of arts to support children and young \npeople\u2019s psychosocial wellbeing. Lessons learnt from this project in Egypt \nand Iraq can be adapted and applied to support young people\u2019s participation \nand build their self-confidence, resilience and empowerment in various \ncontexts.\n3.Sport for Protection Toolkit: Programming with Young People in Forced \nDisplacement Settings\u201d is the result of a multi-agency collaboration between \nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International \nOlympic Committee and Tdh. The toolkit focuses on three key protection \noutcomes: Social inclusion; Social cohesion; and Psychosocial well-being. \nThe methodology has been successfully used in Iran, Colombia, Sri Lanka, \nPalestine, Egypt, Georgia, Eastern Europe and India. \n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nIndia has 450 million internal migrants (2011 census), an increase of 45% since \n2001. Of this, 68% are women. A study[1] conducted by Association for \nStimulating Know-how showed that West Bengal and Jharkhand are among the \nstates from where women migrate for work in high numbers. Children migrate \neither alone or with their family to work. While migration does not necessarily lead \nto trafficking, it creates conditions which make migrating women and children \nmore vulnerable to being traf?cked for sexual exploitation/labour.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these vulnerabilities, putting children \nand young people at increased risk of trafficking and exploitation.\nArriving at a new place, the survivors are cut off from the outside world and forced \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nto live in prison-like conditions by their captors. Documents of identification and \nmoney are immediately seized, and their movements restricted and continuously \nmonitored. Repeated violence triggers suicidal tendencies and trauma in many \nsurvivors. Rescue typically occurs through police raids, help from clients, or \ncaptors releasing the survivors due to age, health conditions, etc. However, their \ntrauma does not end with withdrawal.\nWhat follows is a chaotic and unprepared journey, into an extremely challenging \nprocess of reintegration. Survivors suffer constant terror, guilt, shame and \nhopelessness. Unaware of service providers and bereft of a social support system, \nsurvivors lack adequate occupational skills to begin anew, feel too weak to voice \ntheir concerns and consequently, find it impossible to reintegrate into their own \nsociety.\nThe study conducted by Tdh highlights survivors\u2019 experiences of stigma and the \nhardships they face upon return to their communities, that are major barriers to \ntheir successful reintegration.  Continued stigma, denial, rejection in their own \ncommunities and lack of preparedness of family members to handle the social \nstigma leave them feeling crippled and isolated.\nTdh has been successfully implementing the Learning Grant supported by Oak \nFoundation since 2013 and is currently in Phase II of the grant that concludes in \nOctober 2020. The grant has supported 35 partners to strengthen their existing \npractices of working with survivors and support their mental health and wellbeing. \nIt has also supported development of child centric participatory tools (BECOME, \nEMpowerPLus, Livelihood Precondition) and Counselling Handbook to support \nfrontline workers carrying out the reintegration process.\n44 social workers have been trained on mental health and counselling that has \nincreased their self-confidence and helped them build a trust-based relationship \nwith children.  In 2019, 1124 children were cared for individually, 445 children \nwere supported to receive services and 6508 family members were counselled and \nassisted. 1,933 stakeholders were reached through meetings, workshops and \nconsultation including village and block level child protection committees (VL/BL \nCPCs), Panchayats and Self-Help Groups. The project has engaged with 91 \nVLCPCs for providing support to children and young people.\nPartners have been supported to take up joint advocacy initiatives on the gaps in \nservices.\nUsing the seed grant from Tdh, JLKP was able to support 30 young girls and 45 \nwomen vulnerable to trafficking earn livelihood through making and selling sal \nleaf plates, in an initiative supported by the Pradhan and other villagers. This has \nimmensely enhanced the confidence and self-esteem of the girls whose average \nmonthly family income is now between Rs. 6000-7500. With the money earned \nfrom selling the plates, some women have also initiated poultry farming and \npiggeries.  Villagers have also been connected to government schemes such as the \nJharkhand Tribal Agency.\nUsing the BECOME and Livelihoods pre-condition tools, GGBK staff are now able \nto help survivors identify livelihood options and in the last two years, 46 out of 52 \ngirls receiving livelihood support are earning an income and slowly increasing \nprofits.\n[1] https://www.verite.org/ask-indias-migration-initiatives/", "7.

What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? \nHow will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and \ndecide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nThe project aims to promote inclusive social change by amplifying the voices \nof tribal households in 8 villages in the SBR region of the North and South \n24 Parganas and representing them in research, governance and development \ninterventions. In 4 phases, it aims to (1) enable communities in identifying \ntheir vulnerabilities and development needs and aspirations, and assess their \nOak Application Form     8\nvulnerabilities and climate risks, (2) develop community-led interventions to \naddress those needs and aspirations and reduce vulnerabilities to climate \nchange, and (3) implement these interventions through women-led processes, \nfacilitated by like-minded organizations, (4) assess the effectiveness of the \ninterventions and disseminate the knowledge gained with relevant actors.\nCore Problem: Tribal communities are specifically vulnerable to the effects \nof climate change and have limited assistance to adapt to climate change.\nAccording to researchers from Jadavpur University, the majority of the over \n200,000 tribal people in the SBR remain the most resource-poor and \nvulnerable, inhabiting forest fringe areas characterized by high hazard risks. \nPredominantly landless and ecosystem-dependent, the tribal households have \nlow adaptive capacity. Efforts to uplift tribal communities in the SBR are \nunderwhelming, with limited research on their situation and needs and few to \nno interventions support them adapt to climate change.\n \nUnderlying Problem 1: Needs of tribal communities are unknown and \nunaddressed as they are not represented in research, policy, governance and \nleadership.\nDespite the existence of several pro-tribal policies in India, tribal communities \nremain largely socioeconomically marginalized and poorly represented in \nresearch, policy and governance. Several lacunae in policymaking, such as the \nmandate that the tribal population of a location/region must be at least 50,000 \nor 50% of the total population to qualify for pro-tribal schemes and \ninterventions, exclude and further disempower these communities in the SBR, \nwhere the tribal population is non-dominant and dispersed. With low levels of \nparticipation and leadership, their development needs remain largely \nunknown and unaddressed.\n \nUnderlying Problem 2: Tribal communities have limited or no access to \ninterventions and initiatives to reduce their vulnerability to climate change. \nDue to the lack of alternatives they often rely on indiscriminate exploitation of \nnatural resources and lack sustainable resource management.\nBeing predominantly ecosystem-dependent and non-agrarian, with little to no \nlandholding, makes a significant contribution to the disempowerment of tribal \ncommunities, exposing them to man-animal conflict, denial of forest access, \nand forced migration to urban areas for contractual labour. The loss of \nlivelihood due to natural disasters and lack of sustainable management of \nnatural resources are the main drivers of negative coping strategies adopted \nby the tribal communities. The consequences of these are emissions from \ndeforested mangrove forests and blue carbon loss, decline of fish, crabs and \nshrimps, food insecurity and increase of human-animal conflicts. Though the \nSBR has been globally identified as a key climate change and biodiversity, \nclimate change adaptation for the local communities have been slow and \nunsustainable, owing primarily to the absence of community-centred \napproaches and failure to develop sustainable initiatives which are both locally \nrelevant and accessible. From their previous experience of working for the \ndevelopment and protection of vulnerable rural communities in the SBR, both \nDRCSC and LRRM have noted a dearth of development programs and \ninterventions with a special focus on tribal communities.\nOak Application Form     9\n \nUnderlying Problem 3: Tribal women are specifically marginalized, experience \ngender inequality and often face domestic abuse, neglect and deprivation, with \nno access to mental health care.\nThe disproportionate burden on tribal women remains unaddressed as they \nare severely marginalized by the existing vulnerabilities, climate-related \nstresses and gender inequality. They often assume the role of de facto \nhousehold head in the absence of migrant men, carry overwhelming \nproportions of care work, while also experiencing domestic abuse, neglect \nand deprivation. Women and children in the SBR have no recourse to formal \nmental health support.", "6. PLACE HOLDER": "6. PLACE HOLDER", "7. OBJECTIVES": "7. OBJECTIVES\nThis is the most important part of your application, as it is your opportunity to explain \nwhat you want to achieve and what will be different because of your work. We \nunderstand that social and environmental change is complex and there are a \nmultitude of factors that contribute to change. We want to understand how you define \nyour role in the overall change you hope to make. You may find it helpful to discuss \nthis with your Oak Programme Officer, and others in your own organisation.   \n7.a. Objectives\nList here up to 3 main objectives for this grant (one sentence per objective). Think of objectives as goals \nthat can be achieved within the lifetime of the grant.  We encourage you to think of objective(s) that are \nambitious but also achievable.  \nObjective: Resilience to climate change among tribal communities is \nincreased through identification of their challenges, their empowerment to \nactive participation in finding solutions for the same and consecutive \ndissemination of the knowledge gained with relevant actors. Interventions to \nimprove the resilience and living conditions of tribal communities, that are \ntested, adjusted to the context and identified as effective, are scaled up in \nterms of geographical and target group outreach through a follow-up project \nfor which funding from private and public institutions is secured.\nThe activities will be undertaken by DRCSC and LRRM as local partners, \nresearch consultants and SoH as German re-granting organisation, facilitator \nand supporter of capacity building workshops in India and knowledge \ndissemination and advocacy events/workshops in India and Germany. DRCSC \nwill be responsible for the direct implementation of research and interventions \nin Hingalganj, Sandeshkhali I Block and Kakdwip Block. LRRM will be \nresponsible for direct implementation of research and interventions in Kultali \nBlock. A project Management board fitted with staff members from both \norganizations will ensure the appliance of equal standards, approaches and \nOak Application Form     10\nmethodologies during research and interventions and support cooperation \nbetween the organizations.\nThe project shall lay the foundation for a planned follow-up project to \nstrengthen the resilience against climate risks of tribal communities in the \nSundarbans and to improve their living conditions. The Objective of the \npresent project (knowledge gained on needs & challenges; development of \neffective and context specific interventions; establishment of networks and \nknowledge sharing between local and international practitioners and donors) \nwill serve as a basis for this purpose. The follow-up project shall be timely \noverlapping with the present project (planned start in 2024/25 \u2013 depending \non the evolvement of the present project) and shall have a budget of between \n800,000 \u2013 1,200,000 EUR. Public and private funding will be secured, inter \nalia, through networking activities under Outcome 1.\n7.b. Expected Outcomes (bullet points):\nWhat do you expect will change because of this grant? What does success look like? List here \nthe main outcomes you hope to achieve or make significant contributions towards with this \ngrant, and for whom.  If you have concrete targets, please also list them here. Outcomes \ndescribe significant changes for people, communities, organisations or systems. Some \nexamples are changes in policies and legislation; changes in knowledge, awareness, \nattitudes, beliefs, behaviours or social norms; changes in capacities, level of influence, \nagency or access to services. Please refer to the guidance for additional examples.\nOutcome 1: Needs and challenges of tribal communities are identified through \nan ethnographic research and different Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) \ntools. Interventions adapted to the local context and target group (Outcome 2) \nare assessed and best practices are identified. The knowledge gained on \nchallenges and effective interventions is shared with relevant stakeholders \nand decision makers.\nGiven the currently scant ethnographic engagement with tribal communities \nin the SBR, research consultants in cooperation with DRCSC/LRRM will \nconduct an in-depth ethnographic study to understand the sociocultural \ncontext, practices, development needs and aspirations of vulnerable tribal \ncommunities, assess their vulnerabilities and climate risks in order to promote \nawareness of, and protection for, their cultures, customs, rights and interests \nand to adapt effective interventions for their needs. To avoid further alienating \nthe marginalized communities and to ensure that development initiatives are \nsustainable in the long term, intervention design must be just, fair, inclusive, \nlocally relevant, and developed and implemented through a people-centred \napproach. Insights from the ethnographic survey, vulnerability and risk \nassessment study and relationship-building exercise will enable the project \norganisers to both assess the needs and aspirations of the communities and \nfacilitate their participation and stewardship in intervention design and \nactivity implementation.\n \nOutcome 2: Community-led development interventions aligned to the needs of \ntribal communities have been designed, piloted, evaluated and improved. \nOak Application Form     11\nClimate risk reduction is increased and the socioeconomic resilience of the \ntarget group is strengthened.\nThe planned activities under this Outcome will be based on the findings of the \npreceding research and assessments (Outcome 1). They are designed \nparticipatory together with the target group in a form that indigenous \nknowledge systems are upheld and combined with scientific methods. The \nprocess is community-led, meaning that the collaborating organizations and \nresearchers\u2019 primary moderate the process, contributing their knowledge and \ncapacities rather than taking the direct lead. The interventions are \ncontinuously monitored, evaluated and improved. The interventions focus on \ngroup formation and empowerment, climate adaptive and diversified \nlivelihoods, organic agriculture, shore protection and dissemination of critical \ninformation to the target group. As the process unfolds over time, the \ncapacities of the community representatives are enhanced to emerge as \ncompetent trainers who can achieve self-reliance and continue the community-\nled work after the completion of the project. Local stewardship will not only \nenable the project team to successfully overcome the communities\u2019 hesitation \nor reluctance in adopting the initiatives but also promote leadership, cohesion \nand decision-making agency.\n \nOutcome 3: Physical and mental health challenges of the tribal communities \nare addressed. Good health is promoted and access to government health \nprograms is established.\nThe absence of adequate healthcare facilities is accompanied with a lack of \nawareness of locally prevalent healthcare issues and health-seeking behaviour \namong the communities. While there is scant literature on the condition of \nphysical and mental health in the SBR, there is an absolute absence of tribal \ncommunities in health and well-being-related research, policy and governance \nin the region. In addition to hypertension, pulmonary and gastrointestinal \nissues associated with certain environmental hazards like soil and water \nsalinity, mental health disorders like depression, suicide and deliberate self-\nharm, often linked with experiences of man-animal conflict, frequent disaster-\nrelated losses and morbidities, are also widely prevalent. Mental health \nsupport is limited to non-existent in the region, with health camps and \nawareness-building workshops seldom mainstreaming mental healthcare. In \nthe event of the dual crisis of pandemic-induced reverse migration and \ncyclone-induced rural-urban migration, the lack of infrastructural support and \nsafety nets for migrants and their families became glaringly obvious, and \ncommunities relied only on psychosocial support from their friends and \nrelatives.\nWhile there is no disaggregated data on the health conditions and needs of \ntribal communities, the collaborating organizations are aware that inter-\ngenerational poverty, neglect and exclusion leads to poor physical and mental \nhealth outcomes within these communities. However, knowledge of the \nspecific drivers of poor health and well-being can only emerge from the \nproposed ethnographic survey. The present objective will synthesize relevant \ninsights from the survey to design interventions to reduce the physical and \nmental health challenges of the tribal communities and promote good health \nand overall well-being through the following activities.\nOak Application Form     12\n7.c.

Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or \ntest through this grant.\n(300 words):\na) Monitoring and evaluation: The key functionaries of each collaborating \norganization and the researchers will meet on a bi-monthly basis to reflect on \nlearnings from the community processes, and assess the progress of the \ninitiatives vis-\u00e0-vis a calendar of activities jointly developed by them.  The \nsuccess and failure of different activities and the outcome will be assessed \nthrough household surveys repeated annually and issue-based focus group \ndiscussions in terms of specific indicators.\nThe assessments under Outcome 1 will examine the degree of vulnerability \nand the scope of climate risk reduction, and agency, leadership and self-\nreliance within the vulnerable communities, particularly women and youth. \nFor that matter a performance indicator matrix will be set up and baseline \nindicators will be assessed.\nMonitoring and evaluation of the progress of the initiatives will be primarily \ngeared upon a WSHG-led process. The collaborating organizations will \nevaluate at 2 levels: (1) internal, to continuously examine how effective, \npeople-centric, culturally-sensitive and gender-responsive the decisions, \napproaches and interventions are throughout the lifecycle of the project. The \nresearchers will conduct yearly and final evaluation surveys, prepare survey \nreports, and identify avenues/indicators of improvement; and (2) at the \ncommunity level, where the group leaders shall continually examine the \nprogress of the initiatives over time, in terms of indicators of inclusivity, \ngender-responsiveness, vulnerability reduction and self-reliance etc.\nb) Learning: The project seeks to learn about the unique vulnerabilities, \nneeds and aspirations of marginalized tribal groups in the SBR, that are \nlargely invisible in research and unreached in development governance. \nThese ethnographic insights will create a support base for planning, up-\nOak Application Form     16\nscaling and implementation of suitable community-led initiatives in future, to \naddress the needs and reduce the vulnerabilities of this population.", "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGES\nWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your \noutcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?\nWe understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we \nexpect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be \nopen to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your \noutcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? \n(300 words):\nThe project\u2019s approach and proposed thrust of interventions i.e., \nencouraging vulnerable tribal communities in the SBR to articulate their \nvulnerabilities and unique development needs, and piloting suitable \ninterventions to address these through WSHGs and local youths\u2019 groups, is \nlikely to pose multiple challenges and risks. Some of these anticipated \nchallenges relate to mobilization of disempowered groups like tribal women \nand youth amidst their regular duties and struggles, and finding acceptance \nwithin the community for the implementation of innovative and modern \ninitiatives which demand significant behaviour change and inform a slow \nprocess of transformation. The anticipated risks include potential resistance \non the part of powerful vested interests and political lobbies, which poses a \nthreat to community-led work at the frontline. The collaborating \norganizations can reduce these risks by facilitating regular and transparent \ncommunication between the community representatives, state and local \ngovernments and the project team. Another challenge would be in promoting \nsustainable livelihood options among some of the tribes, like the Shabars, \nwho are traditionally hunter-gatherers, predominantly non-agrarian and \ndependent on forest and ecosystem services. The research team shall \naddress this challenge through knowledge-sharing efforts, learning from \nindigenous in similar conditions from other parts of the country/ world as \nwell as by negotiating with the Department of Forest for sustainable use of \nforest resources. Other challenges relate to knowledge gaps about tribal \nconcerns and interests, and gaps in understanding of, and commitment to, an \ninclusive approach to sustainable development, and probable non-availability \nof necessary skills and local resources for facilitation at the frontline level. \nThese knowledge gaps and capacity deficits will be addressed through \nresearch to gain relevant ethnographic insights and training and information \nmaterials for the staff, facilitators, researchers and community \nrepresentatives, to enhance their understanding and capabilities vis-\u00e0-vis \nrights-based, gender-responsive, culturally-sensitive and locally-relevant \ncommunity-led approaches to tribal development.\nOak Application Form     17", "11.

(600 words):\nSundarbans is an ecologically fragile zone spread across two countries. There \nis a space for learning from interventions across both. In Phase 1, 114 groups \nof vulnerable people in five Gram Panchayats of Patharpratima (Digambarpur, \nGopalnagar, Herambagopalpur, Achintyanagar and Banashyamnagar), South \n24 Parganas, West Bengal, were identified and brought together to diagnose \ntheir vulnerabilities, articulate aspirations and avenues of change, and work \ntogether. The project covers 20 villages with a population estimate of \n1,06,650.\nAfter Phase 1, field staff assessed that 29% groups were active and functional \n\u2013 meeting frequently, discussing issues of relevance, taking part in activities, \ntaking ownership of issues and expressing a need for continued engagement. \nGroup members found value in learning new information, finding confidence \nand exercising collective bargaining power.  \nThey identified issues for action in Phase 2:\n\uf0a7Effects of climate change (life and livestock threatened by eroding \nembankments and frequent flooding; livelihoods impacted by \nincreasing soil salinity, limited water resources, poor market linkages);\n\uf0a7Gender-based discrimination and violence (early marriage; domestic \nviolence; limited opportunities for girls in education /livelihoods; lower \nwages for women workers; menstrual taboos);\n\uf0a7Limited access to rights and entitlements (poor healthcare; limited \nawareness about government schemes);\n\uf0a7Unsafe migration (dropouts, especially among boys;)\n\uf0a7Lack of sustainable livelihood options (unsafe migration, dropout)\nPhase 2 aims to continue the work done while bridging some gaps:\nOak Application Form     7\n\uf0a7Target-driven activity-focus of implementation that overshadowed \nprocess-oriented actions\n\uf0a7Limited coordination amongst resource agencies affected holistic \nperspective for staff and communities\n\uf0a7Community leadership devoid of perspectives / stands\n\uf0a7Focus of what should change rested with organisations rather than with \ncommunities\n\uf0a7Hesitation / reluctance to PRI engagement\nTo meet these gaps, the consortium framed a theory of change which is \npresented below:\n1. How is change within community visualised?\nAfter forming their own micro-level plans, the dynamics between community \nand organisation changed to dependence because of the nature of \ninterventions and expectations of communities. The transformation being \nvisualised in the community is\n\u2022From formulating plan to owning the plan by periodic revisiting / \nevolving their change journey driven by their unique needs (and \nperspectives)\n\u2022From individual actions / actions that benefit individuals to collective \nactions\n\u2022From receiving organisation\u2019s strategies and directions to community-\nled actions that are more organic, impactful, and sustainable \ntransformation\n\u2022From implementing organisation\u2019s agenda to informing organisation\u2019s \nagenda through careful assessment of their strengths, weaknesses, \nrisks and opportunities\n2. How is change within organization visualised?\nAs community groups assume leadership roles, the organisation\u2019s role \ntransforms\n\u2022From direct control to providing facilitative support\n\u2022From providing trainings to mentoring community resource persons\n\u2022From leading networking initiatives to strategic advice on stakeholder \nengagement\n\u2022From a culture of learning (one-way) to a culture of reflection (analytical \nprocess)\n\u2022From becoming visible in Patharpratima to networking and \ncollaboration that visibilises ACV beyond Patharpratima\n3. Is the project truly being able to reach the most marginalised \u2013 \ncommunities within the village and villages within the block?\nThe consortium must discern whether there are still communities that are \nsidelined because of identity / the work they do / their inaccessibility / their \ninability to give time etc. and what further actions are warranted. For this to \nOak Application Form     8\nhappen within the people-centred, community-led model, it is important for \ncommunities to form their own perspectives around marginalization.\nPraxis UK sees Phase 2 as an opportunity to showcase ACV as a model of \ncross-learning and introspection in other geographies, contexts and funding \nscenarios. ACV\u2019s learnings can be offset with similar experiences of \ncommunity development in Bangladesh and other countries.

By \nYear 2 and Year 3, ten more such model community collectives will be \nstrengthened. (Total 15) (For example, four surveys covering 500+ \nrespondents have been undertaken by adolescents across all hubs on \nmenstruation-related issues such as taboos / menstrual hygiene; this will be \nanalysed through different lenses and the groups will carry out stakeholder \nengagement on accessing menstrual hygiene and addressing root cause of \ntaboos - analysis is ongoing) \nBy Year 3, at least 180 community persons (including 30 fellows and at least \nten members from each of the above mentioned 15 collectives) will emerge as \ninformed change agents equipped to engage on different issues with different \nstakeholders - such as PRI members, VLCPC members, village elders, block \nofficials.

(300 words):\nIn Phase 1, the consortium publicised different aspects of its experiences in a \nrange of forums, regional, national and international. Through Oak\u2019s grantee \nmeetings too, the ACV experience has received wide attention and interest \nwith organisations expressing interests in supporting the initiative.\nDespite this, the consortium in Phase 1 has been guarded about sharing its \nexperiences widely. This is anticipated to change in terms of visibilising the \nconsortium\u2019s work. The consortium shall proactively seek spaces where \ncommunity leaders can present their experiences of being part of collectives. \nThe planned block-level consultations is a step in this direction. The \nplatforms for the same must be identified through a thorough mapping of \nrisks and opportunities.\nAs mentioned in Section 7.1.a and 7.2.b, the consortium members are also \nidentified spaces where they can facilitate networking platforms, as in \nGopalnagar Panchayat, through partnerships with organisations such as \nTerre des Homme and Welthungerhilfe.\nThere is much scope for engagement with PRIs.

This built a foundation for the ACV in several locations, \nvisibilising the partners. This also exposed the project in its initial days to \nunreasonable expectations from the community. These were and will be \naddressed through a process of sensitisation.\nThrough gradual processes of trainings, partner staff are being oriented on \nengaging with local administrations such as panchayat, police officers, \nservice providers and others through negotiations and rapport building. As \nthe PRI members in some locations are newly elected, partners can build \nnew relationships through the community members rather than being at the \nforefront of networking.

(maximum 300 \nwords):\nSEWA was founded in 1972 by Smt. Ela Bhatt who was honoured with the \nprestigious National award of Padmashri and Padma Bhushan and gained \ninternational acclaim for her work and was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay award. \nWith her guidance, SEWA has been instrumental in spreading across eleven states \nof India.\nSEWA Bharat, all India federation of SEWA is headed by Smt. Renana Jhabvala \nwho worked in the initial years in Gujarat. She is the recipient of Padma Shri from \nGovernment of India.\nThe Organisation has an executive board which comprises five distinguished \nwomen leaders nominated from the different member organizations of the \nFederation. These members are experienced social workers who have given shape \nto the organization. Their vast experience in the informal economy and with \nwomen workers has contributed to organizing women of the informal sector and \nexpanding the SEWA movement. These leaders have been instrumental in many \npolicy decisions affecting the poor women working in the informal economy, both \nin their states and at the national level.\nThe SEWA Bharat National Coordinator is appointed by the Board to oversee all \nthe activities within the organisation and coordinate with other SEWA institutions \nin a manner that the Federation office can pull in resources from other mature \nSEWAs in addition to the projects that SEWA Bharat implements directly. The \nNational Coordinator is also a bridge between the two National Institutions -SEWA \nBharat and SEWA Union to highlight advocacy issues from the ground to the \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20135\nNational platform.\nSEWA Bharat\u2019s broad organisational strategies are made through the Working \nCommittee, which is elected from the Executive Board with the support of the \nNational Coordinator. The National Coordinator is supported by a Central team of \nsector-specific professionals, Finance & Accounts, HR and Admin teams. Each \nstate also has state coordinators and other programme coordinators and field staff. \nWhere the work covers several districts, the state may have its local admin team. \nSEWA Bharat has a total staff strength of 300+ Employees and full-time \nconsultants.\nA Central Team, consolidated  at SEWA Bharat in 2019, whose core mission to \nfocus on organizational development and strategy, along with the respective state \nCORE teams to work with each other in an integrated approach and create a \nplatform of learning and growth; this enables a streamlined approach to increase \nproductivity and ensure a holistic and integrated approach  towards issues of \nwomen workers \n6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\nFinancial Overview:\nSEWA Bharat has committed funding for the organisation for the next three years \nto the tune of INR 61 Crores. We have committed funding of INR 87lacs - for \nsupporting the project activities in Jharkhand & West Bengal. A dedicated team of \nprofessionals under the guidance of the President and National Coordinator \nthrough networking, bids and any other source of the proposal, tries to raise funds \nfor the normal and special requirements of the organisation. Many of the programs \nwork closely with the Government where the gaps are filled in through \nGovernment support like training space, modules and workshops.SEWA Bharat \ntries to build up a Core and Reserve fund to mitigate against any future risks and \nit explained in details in the following section. \nOne of the challenges that we may foresee is exchange rate fluctuations impacting \nthe FCRA funding. The other challenge is the ongoing pandemic situation, where \nwe have planned certain activities which may not happen in the expected scale if \nthe pandemic and lockdown extends beyond an estimated guess. However, SEWA \nBharat is trying to mitigate these by bringing Digital knowledge to as many of the \ngrassroots leaders through the support of ongoing and potential funding and \nbuilding the capacity of grassroots leaders and staff to hold meetings for training, \nsharing learning and other activities\n \nFunding Model:\nSEWA Bharat has secured funds from various donors like USAID, BMGF, EILEEN \nFISHER, etc to support our ongoing activities. We have also submitted proposals \nfor fundraising which are currently in pipeline through IDS, Pacesetter, Fidelity, \nUpwork Foundation, PCI, etc. We are also applying different strategies for \nfundraising like focusing on individual donors, Exploring online platforms for \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\nfundraising, like Guidestar, Razorpay,  etc. We are also registered as Guide star; \nMilaap; Give India; Upwork; WEIGO; Benevity; Keeto, Equality Fund; USAID; JICA \nCharities Aid foundation. Crowdfunding- we are focusing on our PR and \nCommunications, donations, etc.\n \nReserves and Endowments:\nSince SEWA Bharat goal is to organize workers to achieve their goals of full \nemployment and self-reliance through the strategy of struggle and development. \nThe struggle is against the many constraints and limitations imposed on them by \nsociety and the economy. In order to maintain continuity and to keep our activities \nongoing and address challenges from time to time especially at the grassroots \nlevel, we have created a CORE and reserve fund, where we receive funds through \nan overhead contribution from different projects implemented, interest income, \nmembership fees, donations, etc. Since we are expanding at it is becoming difficult \nto maintain a sufficient level of funds in CORE, we keep on putting our efforts to \nraise funds from different sources. \n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\n1. Establishing SEWA Shakti Kendras (SSKs) as local resource centres have \nbeen one of the most successful initiatives so far. Through the SSKs, SEWA \nacts as an important link with the government for successful outreach of its \nprograms. These SSKs in Bengal have been instrumental in registering 2000 \nmembers and spreading awareness around the State Scheme for \nUnorganised Sector workers introduced in 2018, which led to 5000 more \nmembers registering themselves under this scheme.\n2. Created a network of grassroots leaders called agewans across India in \nspecific geographies. They are the link between people and the government \nand make efforts to reach information to community members, address \ncommunity needs as well as ensure linkages with compensatory packages, \nwelfare schemes and developmental programs. They are at the frontline \nsupplementing the government efforts during COVID-19. Agewans have \nspearheaded the SEWA-led distribution of 50,000+ food and hygiene kits \nand last-mile delivery in places where the reach of the PDS system has been \nerratic. The work of Agewans has been recognised and SEWA Bharat has \nbeen specially mentioned for its support during COVID-19 by the NITI \nAayog.\n3. Most significant in recent times is SEWA Bharat\u2019s participation at the \nUN High-Level Panel [UNHLP] on Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment \n[WEE] and subsequent conversations in India to contextualise the UNHLP \nrecommendations for India. During this period, SEWA Bharat hosted a \ndiscussion with Phumzile Mlambo-ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women \nat its headquarters in Delhi and is right now contributing towards the \ndevelopment of a national roadmap on WEE in India. \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\n6d.

What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nAs of 2018, both the states feature very low on the Human Development Index \n[HDI] (0.641 and 0.599[1]), and their HDI score is below the national average \n(0.647). With 19.98% and 36.96%[2] of the population of West Bengal and \nJharkhand living in poverty and 71.16% and 56.21%[3] female literacy rates, the \nproblems of poverty, the gender divide in educational attainment, income and \naccess to resources is widespread. Women are often the primary breadwinners \nand caregivers of a household in these states as men tend to migrate out for better \nwork opportunities, yet, women remain at the fringes of work and income, eking \nout a livelihood under extremely exploitative conditions. This gets reflected in the \nfalling Female Labor Force Participation Rate [FLPR] in both states. The female \nlabour force participation in West Bengal has increased from 18.08 in 2011 to 23.3 \nin 2018, the same has reduced from 29.10 in 2011 to 18.08 in 2018 in \nJharkhand[4]. \nIf we see in terms of trades, research shows that most agricultural workers are \nwomen in these states, but their landholding is minimal and productivity has been \nconstantly decreasing due to climate change, migration of males and limited \naccess to government benefits. Beedi workers are struggling to continue with their \nlivelihood and domestic workers are denied leaves and fair wages. SEWA has done \nan exploratory study in Jharkhand, (SEWA Exploratory Study Jharkhand, 2016) \nwhich shows that 63% of women have no awareness of the welfare boards and \nvery few workers have identity cards. We have seen that women take up seasonal \nwork and remain unemployed for a large part of the year. They rely on contractors \nand middlemen to broker their salary and conditions and often entangle \nthemselves in large amounts of debt. Not being able to go up the supply chain, \nupskill themselves or gain income mobility are predominant issues as well. Their \nworking conditions are equally precarious owing to their lack of bargaining power. \nEarly pregnancy[5] is reportedly common, women and girls face restrictions on \ntheir mobility and traditional caregiving roles are encouraged for women while \ntaking up non-traditional work is frowned upon.\nIn the past 3 years in Jharkhand and 16 years in West Bengal, SEWA has unionised \nand collectivised more than 20,000 women in the informal economy. SEWA has \nworked towards increasing collective bargaining strength, empowering \ncommunities to access information and entitlements through SSKs, enhancing skill \nand creating opportunities for access to markets. The effort is being led by a cadre \nof 129 agewans (grassroots leaders). Following are the preliminary findings from \nthe end-project impact assessment (phone-based) study conducted in both states in \nJuly-August 2020.[6]\n\u2022A majority of the respondents, that is 65.60%, women attend unit \nmeetings organised by SEWA at least once a month. While the remaining \nmembers attend meetings once in two or three months.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\n\u202250% of all members have received at least one type of training offered \nby SEWA in the last 2 years.\n\u2022Among all trades/work, a majority of domestic workers (57%) and beedi \nworkers (51%) are aware of at least one form of entitlement/govt. or \nemployer benefit that they are eligible for (minimum wages[44%], weekly \noffs [31%], provident fund [24%], Occupational Health Safety compensation \n[29%], Tool and Safety Kit Support Scheme (25%), Use of traditional seeds \n(13.6%) and Organic fertilizers(10.6%)\n\u202266.3% SEWA members have indicated that they received information \nabout trade-specific entitlements and benefits from SEWA compared \nto other sources of information.\n\u202222% of SEWA members have ever used the SEWA Shakti Kendras \npremises  to apply for a scheme or to apply for a government identification \nor avail a government benefit\nGoing forward, we would strengthen the existing cadre of agewans so they can \nlead community efforts and SSKs and create new agewans and SSKs. We would \nalso address women\u2019s trade-specific needs, explore alternate livelihoods so women \ncan diversify or pivot their income sources and simultaneously, look to build our \ngrassroots advocacy. The next generation of young leaders will also be created to \nensure continuity of the movement and relationships with the local administration \nand government officials will be nurtured to ensure strong private-public \npartnership. The above feeds into SEWA Bharat\u2019s commitment to ensuring full \nemployment and self-reliance for women in the informal economy. SEWA Bharat \nhas been building the capacity of its member organisations and advancing the \nrights of women workers through its twin goals of organising and struggle. We \nhave different streams of work focused on unionising women; advancing gender \nequality and rights; trying out innovative and different models of organising \nwomen such as union, federation, cooperatives, collective social enterprises, \nproducer companies; and fostering women\u2019s economic empowerment by \nincreasing women\u2019s access to market and finance.\nThough the registration process for a state union has been facing bureaucratic \nbarriers in Bengal, SEWA members continue their alliance with the National Union \nand would continue holding trade group meetings as is done within a formal union \nstructure in the state.\n \n[1] Sub National HDI Global Database https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/IND/\n[2] Handbook of Statistics on Indian States by the Reserve Bank of India \nhttps://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook%20of%20St\natistics%20on%20Indian%20States\n[3] Census of India, 2011\n[4] Annual Report - Periodic Labour Force Survey 2018-2019 by Ministry of \nStatistics and Programme Implementation \nhttp://mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Annual_Report_PLFS_201\n8_19_HL.pdf\n[5] In the Fourth National Family Health Survey Percentage of women aged 15-19 \nyears who were pregnant or already mothers during the survey in West Bengal is \n18.3%  and in Jharkhand is 12%. http://rchiips.org/NFHS/factsheet_NFHS-4.shtml\n[6] The final report is being compiled for circulation.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139", "7.

In this case, it is still necessary to specify activities \nand results/outcomes for this objective.\nFor project support grants please list your objectives for this project in bullet point \nformat. (You may use additional space if you have more than three objectives)?. \nUnder each objective describe the activities that your organisation will undertake to \nachieve it, including time frame and the results or outcomes you expect to achieve.\n7.1.a. Objective 1 (maximum one sentence):\nTo strengthen the collective bargaining capacity of new and existing \ngrassroots leaders and young girls by building capacity and nurturing \ngrassroots leadership \n7.1.c. Objective 1\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\n1.Strengthening the capacity of the cadre of Agewans: Currently, we \nhave developed 129 agewans [69 agewans in Jharkhand and 60 agewans in \nWest Bengal]. SEWA is now looking to intensify its agewan strengthening \nprogram with a total of 205 agewans. We will use SEWA\u2019s agewan \ndevelopment module to give training to new agewans and refresher training \nto the existing cadre. In addition, the agewans are also trained in \nnegotiation skills with their employers, Mahajan, local authorities and family \nmembers. We will be adding new topics such as addressing violence in the \nworld of work, basics of data collection, evidence-based advocacy and digital \nliteracy. Exclusive training will be held on digital literacy with online \ntraining during the COVID restriction phase.\n2.Community Meetings led by agewans: Agewans will lead the village-\nbased unit meetings with the women over the next 3 years. They will also \n7.1.b. Objective 1\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\n\u2022A cadre of 205 grassroots leaders/agewans will be built in the next 3 years \nwith leadership, negotiation and decision-making skills to lead the \ncommunity advocacy efforts\n\u202214 Yuva Mandals of 15 girls each will be created to foster youth leaders and \nchampions at the grassroots level in the next 3 years\n\u2022A total of 41,000 members will be strengthened across the two states over \nthe next 3 years\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201310\ncontribute to and participate in village council meetings. SEWA will \nhandhold agewans during the 3 years and track progress post-training.\n3.Developing youth leaders and champions and strengthening the \nexisting champions: SEWA has created 10 Yuva Mandals reaching out to \n140 girls in West Bengal in the past 3 years. SEWA will make efforts to \nsustain the existing 10 Yuva Mandals in West Bengal and the 4  new Yuva \nMandals in Jharkhand while seeking to initiate a few new Yuva Mandals in \nJharkhand. These youth groups will be trained in two thematic streams: \nbasic aspects of gender equality being one which will include good touch \nand bad touch, life skills, sexual and reproductive health, problems related \nto early marriage; social issues and technical skills including digital \nliteracy, research methods and data collection techniques. Emphasis will be \nlaid on the importance of safe migration and self-defence to prepare girls for \ntheir life going forward. We will work with Integrated Child Development \nServices [ICDS] to link with government schemes, with counselling and \nhealth services meant for adolescent girls. These youth leaders and \nchampions will play a key role in taking this movement forward.\n4.Organizing exposure visits: SEWA\u2019s training model integrates classroom \ntraining with practical training that includes regular interaction with \nstakeholders and exposure visits. To this end, exposure visits are aimed to \nengender cross-learning and information sharing, building a broader and \npragmatic understanding of ground-level situations and understanding the \ndifferent models/pathways of work in other states and organisations along \nwith developing empathy and compassion among the grassroots leaders, \nyouth groups and SEWA team members. In the past, SEWA has conducted \nexposure visits to different other SEWA states, for example, women of West \nBengal visited Jharkhand earlier to meet SEWA Jharkhand members. This \nhelped them to see the replicability of learnings and adapt the learning from \nthe other states. In a similar manner, exposure visits will be organized to \nother SEWA states to facilitate an understanding of the nuances around \nSEWA\u2019s unionisation and movement building work over the years.\n5.Capacity building sessions of state teams to SEWA ethos and \nobjectives of the program: SEWA Bharat has worked with a dynamic \nproject team in the past years and will continue to build their capacities so \nthey can effectively implement this project as well. To this end, SEWA will \ncarry out refresher training for team members on SEWA ethos, on SEWA \nunion and its years of struggle and movement building work. Additionally, \nteam members will receive training in gender equality and decent work for \nwomen, how to take collective action, and how to challenge patriarchy. \nSEWA will develop the team\u2019s understanding of the objectives of this \nprogram. Though the project has been developed in consultation with \ngrassroots teams, orientation and onboarding exercise will revitalise the \nteam spirit, triggering cross-learning and information exchange.\n6.Organising campaigns for community awareness generation: In the \npast years, campaigns have played a crucial role in inspiring attitudinal \nchange in West Bengal and Jharkhand. Therefore, SEWA will organise \ncampaigns on a rolling basis to circulate key messages on welfare schemes, \nlife skills, health and on prevention of violence against women in the world \nof work. Information on new opportunities will be circulated. Examples of \nrole models will be shared through these campaigns and linkages will be \nensured.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201311\n7.2.a. Objective 2 (maximum one sentence):\nTo empower communities through access to information and entitlements \nwith the help of the SEWA Shakti Kendras [SEWA empowerment centres] \nin Jharkhand and West Bengal\n7.2.c. Objective 2\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\n1.Strengthening the existing SEWA Shakti Kendras [SSK] and creating \nnew SSKs: SEWA has set up 6 SEWA Shakti Kendras (SSKs) as local \nresource centres in West Bengal and Jharkhand. The SSK is a place where \npeople meet and share their common concerns and have dialogues to \naddress larger issues faced by them, at the same time obtain up-to-date \ninformation on all programmes and schemes. It connects community \nmembers with government schemes and services. Our efforts are to make it \na community-owned, community-managed centre under the leadership of \nwomen and young people. Based on the needs assessment done this year, \nSEWA will aim to set up 8 new SSKs and strengthen the 6 existing \nSSKs with infrastructure and digital tools across the two states in the \ncourse of 3 years. (Refer to Annexure 2 for the model)\n2.Training cum orientation of SSK centre-in-charges: A total of 14 SSK \nin-charges will be trained in two-phased training with a focus on digital \nliteracy and use of digital devices and software. Government linkages and \ntrade memberships, linking with social security, how to operate an online \napplication platform, and a broader understanding of advocacy and \ngovernment interactions etc. will be a part of the training.\n3.Procurement of new software and hand holding on how to use the \nsoftware: A software will be procured and will be tailored to the needs of \nthe SSKs. This will be installed in the desktops/laptops and tablets at the \nSSKs. The software will help generate dashboard, maintain database and \nrecord of members among other things.\n4.Delivery of services by the SSK: SSKs will carry out linkages with \ngovernment schemes and services. A digital database on relevant schemes \nwill be provided to the SSKs by the national SEWA Bharat team to help \nSSKs carry out the linkages. The SSK will also respond to the health \n7.2.b. Objective 2\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\n\u2022Over the next 3 years, 100% linkages with state-specific schemes such as \nSamajik Suraksha Yojna;all-India schemes such as MGNREGA, ration card, \nJSY and health schemes will be ensured\n\u2022In the next 3 years, registration of workers under the sector-specific \nschemes and boards will be ensured\n\u2022SSKs will reach out to over 50,000 community members for social security \noutreach.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201312\nconcerns affecting women and girls. It will also address issues of violence in \nthe world of work. SSK will act as the site for training and learning at the \nunit level.\n5.Providing handholding support and overall tracking: SEWA Bharat will \nprovide handholding support to all stakeholders and will track their work \nthroughout the course of three years. MIS systems will help record and \ntrack information on members and help generate reports. All data will be \nentered into the digital MIS systems. SEWA will continue with its holistic \napproach of hand-holding beyond the training period through post-training \nagewan engagement activities and meetings and will prepare the agewans \nfor community engagement, government liaisoning and grassroots \nadvocacy.\n7.3.a. Objective 3 (maximum one sentence):\nTo collectivise women workers [beedi workers, domestic workers, \nconstruction workers, street vendors, agri-workers] to enable them to \nbetter engage with stakeholders in the value chain for full employment \nand have better access to markets and resources\n7.3.c. Objective 3\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\n1.Strengthening the trade groups: In the past years, SEWA has organised \nand unionised women into separate trade groups at the community level. So \nfar, West Bengal has 1 domestic worker group and 3 beedi workers groups \nwhile Jharkhand has 1 construction worker group, 15 domestic workers \ngroups, 9 construction worker groups, 22 agricultural worker groups. These \nhave been formed for women to share and discuss their concerns within \nthese groups. In the next few years, SEWA will strengthen these groups \nfurther with the leadership of the agewans. Strengthening a group will \nrequire training and handholding agewans and linkage building. The trade \ngroups will address the sector-specific needs.\n2.Strengthening trade committees: SEWA has set up trade committees \n7.3.b. Objective 3\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\n\u202230% of the women domestic workers trained will have increased wages and \nweekly offs\n\u202210,000 beedi workers will have access to PF benefit\n\u202230% trained in tailoring and stitching will have increased income\n\u202210% agri-workers will have increased productivity\n\u2022200 women/girls will be linked with alternate livelihood\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201313\n(representation from all sectors, unlike Trade group which is sector-specific) \nin the two states. In West Bengal, trade committees will decide the work \nand strategy for the whole year for the different trade groups and will carry \nout the advocacy agenda on specific issues along with sector-specific \nworkers and local and state-level authorities. They will feed into the \nadvocacy of SEWA national council meetings and unions. The trade \ncommittees will look to increase the membership base within the trade \ngroups to bring more workers under this solidarity building movement. \nTrade committee meetings will take place once a year.\n3.Promoting evidence-based advocacy through multi-stakeholder \nplatforms and meetings: Past learnings have shown that multi-\nstakeholder meetings are a great way to advocate and increase the visibility \nof SEWA\u2019s work. SEWA will create a platform for members so they can \narticulate their needs in front of the inter-sectoral agencies, including \ngovernment officials, private sector players and other CSOs etc. Block, \ndistrict level and state level meetings in both states will be conducted in \nyear 2 and 3. The main purpose of these meetings will be to highlight \nchallenges in front of government officials and figure out synergies to \nenable the creation of shared agendas that can help take common initiatives \nforward in a collaborative partnership with multiple agencies. The evidence \ngenerated at the unit meetings, trade group meetings and the MIS will feed \ninto the advocacy event. The key emerging advocacy issues have been \naround wages, working conditions, provident fund, worker\u2019s recognition, \nincome and market access so far. Alongside this, separate trade-specific \ncampaigns will help highlight and collectively bargain for the needs.\n4.Exploring and linking with alternate livelihoods: Due to COVID, \nSEWA\u2019s stream of workaround exploring and linking with alternate \nlivelihoods has become strong. To that end, an orientation program on \nalternative livelihoods will be organised in partnership with National Rural \nLivelihoods Mission [NRLM] district representatives at the block level in \nboth the states. Simultaneously, the sectors of agriculture and animal \nhusbandry will be explored in Jharkhand with local authorities and NGOs. In \nWest Bengal, through the existing 2 centres, we will continue to offer a 6-\nmonthly training on sewing-tailoring for young girls. SEWA in Malda will tie-\nup with the government training programs for preliminary and advanced \ntraining in sewing and tailoring. We will also explore other hyper-local \nneeds so the children of beedi workers can take up other trades as beedi \nwork has emerged to be unsustainable due to anti-beedi campaigns.", "8.

(300 words)\nWelthungerhilfe started as the German section of the \u201cFreedom from Hunger \nCampaign\u201d \u2013 one of the first global campaigns to fight hunger. In 1962 \nWelthungerhilfe was established under the umbrella of the FAO (UN Food \nand Agriculture Organisation). Since its inception, the organisation has \norganized funding of EUR 3.71 billion for more than 9,331 overseas projects \nin 70 countries.\nDuring last 10 years Welthungerhilfe has developed framework, module and \nexamples of rural skill building across 5 states through 13 skill building \ninstitution named Green College. Through these colleges 50000 trainees \nwere trained on green skills. The proposed project will use experience of this \nGreen College initiative (https://welthungerhilfeindia.org/initiative/green-\ncolleges-initiative/).\n5c.

(600 words):\nSundarbans is a part of the tidally active delta where the land building \nprocess is still incomplete with Ganges-Brahmaputra River system carries \nsuspended sediment load through numerous interlacing channels, \nintervening islands with the elevation of less than 3 meters above msl. \nAgriculture forms the backbone of the economy of Sundarban, where the \nentire area is dependent on a single crop, the rain-fed (mostly high yielding \nvarieties) paddy. Sundarbans, is threatened by various biophysical and social \nbarriers, emerges as a unique case where the most vulnerable population \nlives in an extremely vulnerable situation with high risk of hazards which is \ncharacterized by a low level of development and lack of infrastructure, \nprevalence of extreme poverty and lack of health facilities. It is also under \nthe threat of severe coastal erosion due to relative sea level rise, increase in \nsurface air temperatures and increased intensity of cyclone. All these results \ninto the following negative impacting factor for livelihood systems of \nSundarbans - a) increased anthropogenic pressure for livelihood on natural \nresources b) increased seasonal and permanent outmigration c) lack of \nstability in livelihood operations d) landlessness and poor resource profile \ntriggered by land loss/degradation and debt trap.\nOak Application Form     7\nThere is a pressing need of a strategy to create examples of sustainable \nlivelihood options which can transform the local economy. Such \ntransformational strategy needs to be built on:\n\u2022Value chain-based approach where various business opportunities \n(including products and services) can be created along the value chain \nwith backward and forward linkages.  This aims to boost up the entire \neconomy around a product line.\n\u2022Cluster based approach where value chain actors come together in \nhomogeneous or heterogeneous groups depending on the product and \nassociated services. This will create scope of inclusion of members who \ndo not possess resources/means of primary production.\n\u2022Inclusion of vulnerable communities like traffic survivors, landless, \nforest dependents etc. with special focus on youth and women. \n\u2022Gradual shifting from livelihood approach to microenterprises.  \n\u2022Organizing farmers into Farmer Producer Companies for achieve \neconomies of scale and long-term sustainability.\n\u2022Networking with knowledge and financial institute/agencies to \nleverage funding/technical support. Already established Green College \ncan be a strategic institute to support training and capacity building.\n\u2022Developing a team with local CSO partners who can own and continue \nthe initiative.\nThe approach is developed on the basis of a) Welthungehilfe\u2019s experience of \nlast two decades in the region where we have been active with the \ntransformative approaches of multisectoral approach to nutrition, rural skill \nbuilding through green colleges, microplanning involving local community to \nsupport government planning program of GPDP and ecological agriculture b) \nScoping study commissioned by Oak Foundation c) FGD with CSOs of \nSundarbans.", "6.

While \ndeveloping/adopting the content, climate friendly, green, fair and ethical \ntrades/technologies will be given preference.\nA1.3Conduct training courses and mentor high-potential trainees on each \nvalue chain, to build their skills and confidence in managing their own \nbusinesses as well as create job opportunities.\nThe enterprise facilitator team will identify potential trainees from their \nrespective location in a geographical cluster on the basis of set criteria and \nsend them to Green College. Depending on the content, the trainees will go \nthrough training of short term (7 Days), Mid Term (15~30 Days) or Long Term \n(60 Days) courses. The days will be divided equally into residential sessions \nand self-practice sessions. The training method will be a mix of theoretical \n(10~20%), practical (50~60%) Business development skill building (15%) and \nsoft skill building (15%). After the training, the enterprise facilitator will follow \nup and mentor the trainee for a duration of 3~6 months, depending on the \nneed of the trainees. 1000 trainees will be trained in batches of 20~25.\n120 High Potential Rural Youth (HPRY) trainees selected from these 1000, will \nbe taken through Fast Track programme of accelerated learning with ideation \nOak Application Form     10\nphase, innovation camp, communication workshop and network meet.

For instance, fish value chain \nneeds fish feed making machineries, aerator, equipment for water quality \ntesting etc. A Resource User Group will maintain this equipment, which will \ngradually be merged/handed over to the Farmer Producer Organisation \n(A2.1)  \nAssociated with Objective 2\nA2.1Form and register 2 FPOs with at least 100 members associated with \neach.\nFPOs are institutes owned and run by the farmers which creates scope of \ncollectivization of produce, single input production/procurement & knowledge \ntransfer, better bargain power of the producer. 2 FPOs will be formed and \nregistered from the geographical cluster where the project has larger number \nof successful trainees around common trades. FPOs around one primary and \nsome other crops/produce, will be formed in the 3rd year of the project, and \nwill need support for another cycle to become a sustainable institute.\nA2.2Conduct training sessions for the FPO board members on governance, \nfinancial management, and leadership skills.\nThe FPO board member will go through workshop with classroom sessions, \nhands on practice which help the participants to gain a) understanding of FPO \nand role of BoD in FPO operations b)build confidence of BoDs & staff and \nmotivate them towards good governance of FPO c) build the capacities of BoDs \nto take appropriate decisions and steer the FPO towards its business and \ninstitutional goals d) understanding of statutory regulation and day-to-day \noperation of financial management of FPO e) prepare action plan. This will be \ndone through external expert agency, who will also mentor the FPOs for the \ninitial few months.\nA2.3Facilitate the formation of a cluster of 800 trainees across various trades \nto achieve economies of scale, access networking opportunities and support \neach other.\nRest of the 800 trainees, will be monitored regularly and will be assisted for \nfinancial linkages, business development and clustered together as per \nOak Application Form     11\ncommonalities in geography and trade.

Gimi Award in 2004 instituted by Governor \nof West Bengal for contribution to women\u2019s empowerment and social work.\nThe following have been achieved through the past 6 years of partnership with Oak \nFoundation:\n\u2022Dialogue with the Department of Women and Child & Social Welfare (WCD) \nand West Bengal Commission for Women resulting in their issuing directives \nfor implementation of the SHWW Act, 2013 and constitution of Local \nCommittees across all districts. The present status as informed by the Dept. \nof WCD is that, all District Officers submit annual reports to the department \nas mandated in the SHWW Act, 2013.\nTwo state level Orientation Programmes were conducted for the District Social \nWelfare Officers (DSWOs), Ex Officio of the Local Committee, to strengthen the \nfunction of these Committees, in 2015 and 2016 respectively. 15 (out of 20) \nDSWOs were trained through these Orientation Programmes.\nHowever, there is a need in future for a Situation Analysis Research to \nunderstand the knowledge, skill and effectiveness of prevention and redress of \nsexual harassment in the districts, for planning Sanhita\u2019s future intervention.\nSanhita provides handholding support to deal with SHW complaints lodged in \nNorth 24 Parganas Local Committee in the capacity of the Chair of the \nCommittee.\nSanhita in response to the request of the DSWOs, has written and produced SHW \nPrimer under Oak Support which is to be disseminated to District Officers, \nDSWOs and monitoring authorities along with employers and SHW Committees \nfor proper implementation of the SHWW Act, 2013.\n\u2022Dialogue with the Department of Health & Family Welfare and capacity \nbuilding of the key officials in the districts resulted in the decentralised \nconstitution of Internal Committees at CMOH Chief Medical Officer of Health) \noffices across all districts of West Bengal. This was followed by training of \nInternal Committees in five Medical Colleges & Hospitals in Kolkata.\nSanhita also provides handholding support to deal with SHW complaints in the \nInternal Committee of Health Department (Headquarter) and Medical Colleges \n& Hospitals in Kolkata in the capacity of External Member.\nA Situation Analysis Research is needed to know about the present status and \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\nfunctioning in the district committees.\n\u2022Promoted responsibility of employers for women workers from resource poor \nbackgrounds though issue-based partnership with key Government \nDepartments such as Department of Health, WCD, Panchayat & Rural \nDevelopment employing large number of women workers.\n\u2022Engagement with the Directorate of ICDS resulting in the decentralised \nconstitution of Internal Committees in select districts of West Bengal.\n\u2022Enrolled as a Technical and Training Organisation by Administrative Training \nInstitute (ATI), GoWB and engaged in institutional capacity building of a \nrange of stakeholders.\n\u202214 Grassroot leaders were trained on the SHW issue and the SHWW Act. The \nGrassroot Leaders in turn, have raised awareness of over 1000 women \nworkers; primarily construction, domestic and factory workers through 210 \ncommunity meetings conducted over a year in 7 clusters spread across 3 \nblocks of Ranchi District. In all areas ICDS and health workers were involved \nin the community meetings.\nThe women workers have successfully secured some basic entitlements like \ntoilets and place to rest thereby improving the safety at their work spaces. 28 \ndynamic, vocal and articulate women leaders participated in a day long camp \nwhich has further enhanced their awareness on the issue.\nIn the absence of Local Committees, pre-existing community level institutions \n(forums and committees) were identified and strengthened to take up cases of \nsexual harassment/violence against women. At least 30 cases/incidents of SHW \nhave been shared by women workers. Some of these have been taken up for \nredress with the community level institutions.\n\u2022Conducted an Orientation Programme for Government Officials and NGO \nrepresentatives from Eastern & North Eastern States in 2017. Subsequently, \nSanhita was invited by both the government and NGO Networks from the \nstates like Bihar, Orissa and Meghalaya to design and facilitate further \ntraining. Its worth mentioning that Sanhita designed and facilitated the first \nseries of Orientation Programmes for state officials and SHW Committee \nmembers for the Government of Meghalaya in 2019.\nThe SHW Primer produced under the Oak Foundation support will be shared with \nthe Govt. of Meghalaya.\n  Created evidence-based knowledge through field research on SHW from the \nselect institutions and through several multi-lingual IEC materials for a wide \nrange of stakeholders.\n\u2022Strengthened the crisis intervention as external member and advisor of SHW \nCommittees across sectors like PSU, NGOs, Private Organisations, Factories \nand Hospitals.\n\u2022Sanhita received nearly 100 calls from individuals as well as ICs through the \ndedicated helpline seeking assistance for SHW redress which has been \nprovided. Based on two rounds of Case Analysis conducted by Sanhita, we \nobserved that the number of complaints reaching out to Sanhita has gradually \nincreased over the years.\n\u2022Award: Founding Director of Sanhita has been felicitated by GoWB for \ncontribution to the SHW issue in 2016.\n \nThe following achievements of Sanhita\u2019s work on the issue of SHW since \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139\n2015 under the Oak Foundation Support are recognised in the External \nEvaluation (conducted in 2021):  \nGround Breaking Work:\n\u2022Sanhita\u2019s work on sexual harassment at workplace has been ground breaking \nin the context of West Bengal, their engagement spans across government \ndepartments, civil society organisations, law networks and grassroots \noutreach.\n\u2022Sanhita has established and maintained several partnerships that has helped \nthem grow and expand the work they are doing and the support they are \nproviding spanning from training, IEC materials to research & crisis support.\nResponses from the Government Stakeholders:\n\u2022Across government stakeholders there is an agreement, that Sanhita was the \ncorrect organisation to engage as they were experts in the field of sexual \nharassment law, specifically the organisation\u2019s expertise, dedication and long \nhistory of working in the field.\n\u2022Sanhita is thus perceived and recognised as being experts in the field by \nvarious government departments.\n\u2022The networking efforts have allowed Sanhita to be deeply embedded, that is \nthey are recognised and have established relationships and connections \nwithin government systems as the go-to organisation where sexual \nharassment is concerned.\nResourceful IEC and Training Modules:\n\u2022Sanhita has been successful in creating IEC materials whose uptake by \ngovernment departments is a significant achievement.\n\u2022Across SHW Committee members interviewed there was a great appreciation \nof Sanhita\u2019s IEC materials which have been greatly beneficial to the \norganisations and have been used for multiple purposes and at multiple \nlevels.\n\u2022The adaptability of their training modules and their ability to engage \neffectively with a section that is largely left out is commendable.\nResponses from the SHW Committees and Institutional Associations:\n\u2022Across SHW Committees there is a strong recognition of the support they \nhave received from Sanhita. Especially the fact that Sanhita has been \n\u201cproactive\u201d, \u201csensitive\u201d and \u201cpractical\u201d in their dealing of complaints.\n\u2022SHW Committee members have also spoken of the times when Sanhita has \ngone above the call of duty and supported them through very difficult and \ntrying times and how their support gave the Committee courage to fight \ndifficult battles especially against those in power.\n\u2022Sanhita was ascribed to be \u2018extremely proactive\u2019 and \u2018consistent\u2019 in their \nefforts, by the Institutional Associations.\n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201310\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nSanhita is a Gender Resource Centre established with the vision of gender justice \nand gender equity.  Sanhita was founded in the year 1996 to mainstream gender \nconcerns by enabling institutional accountability and systemic changes.\nThe current strategy of Sanhita for the period from 2021 \u2013 2026 is based on the \nabove and has emerged from its past experiences and learning as well as the \nrecommendations of the External Evaluation conducted in 2021:\n\u2022Promoting institutional responsibility for safe workplaces for institutionally \nemployed women workers particularly those from resource poor backgrounds \nthrough:\n\u2022Institutional capacity building and \n\u2022Developing prevention and redressal mechanisms of varied stakeholders (like \nrelevant government departments, monitoring & regulatory bodies, district \nadministration, employers, institutional associations among others)\n\u2022Developing issue based strategic partnerships with working groups, \nconfederations and networks of employers\u2019 and institutional associations \namong others\n\u2022Strengthening redress of SHW by\n\u2022Capacity Building of Complaints Committees through training and \ncounselling services,\n\u2022Intervention & support to women workers and Committees through helpline, \n\u2022Engagement with Committees as external members and advisors to \nmonitoring bodies and different organisations \n\u2022Capacity Building of External Members\n\u2022Developing understanding of the field realities & the implementation status \nof the Act that would shape future work of Sanhita and \n\u2022Continued Knowledge Creation on the issue of SHW for the various \nstakeholders across sectors through \n\u2022Constant review and analysis\n\u2022Evidence based field research\n\u2022Development of IEC and training materials in local languages\n\u2022Promotion of access of women workers to useful information \n\u2022Review of SHW complaints\nThe Recommendations of External Evaluation (conducted in 2021) of Sanhita\u2019s work \non the issue of SHW since 2015 under the Oak Foundation Support:\n\u2022Sanhita needs to percolate down to the grassroots level to include \nmore marginal and vulnerable women -\nThis is being planned & done presently under the PHF funded project where \nthe Anganwadi Workers and leaders of the SHG federations are being reached \nout to through engagement with the relevant departments.\n \n\u2022Need to work on Data Management of cases wherein data is made \navailable to Sanhita, through its engagements, be collected and \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201311\nmanaged in a systematic manner to enable further research -\nPeriodic analysis of SHW complaints sourced from State Women\u2019s \nCommission as well those complaints where Sanhita was engaged either as \nan external member or in an advisory role is part of Sanhita\u2019s ongoing & \nregular work. We plan to share the findings with the monitoring bodies for \nthem to take necessary steps for improving the redress mechanisms.\n \n\u2022Sensitisation of top-level Management in Private Sector Industries \u2013\nSanhita has already initiated the work through strategic partnership with CII. \nWe plan to extend this work to other confederations of industries and \nemployers\u2019 associations under this proposal.  \n \n\u2022Additional Training for ICs \u2013\nThis is being addressed under the PHF funded project where in a detailed \nSituational Analysis of the current status of ICs is being undertaken.

What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nThe premise of the project is to work on the issue of creating safe workplaces for \nwomen.\nSexual harassment is a manifestation of sex discrimination and violence against \nwomen at the workplace that thrives in an atmosphere of threat, terror and reprisal. \nSexual harassment at workplace adversely affects the safety, dignity, mental and \nphysical well-being of women resulting in loss of life, job and livelihood opportunities \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201312\namong others. It is a manifestation of power relations as women are much more \nlikely to be victims of sexual harassment because of their status at work, \nvulnerability, insecurity, and social conditioning.\nChallenges\n24 years post the Vishaka Judgement and 8 years post the enactment of the SHWW \nAct, implementation of the Act in the true spirit is yet to happen. There is however, \nno comprehensive data on the complaints of SHW is available. Based on Sanhita\u2019s \nexperience, the number of recent court judgments and the narratives available post \nthe #MeToo Movement it emerges that many workplaces still believe that SHW is a \nrare or trivial issue and that the women are responsible for their harassments.  \nEvidence shows that the complaints are not dealt with sensitively.  When the woman \nattempts to speak out the pattern is to subvert her credibility to prove that the \ncomplaint is motivated, if not false. \nLack of employer accountability towards effective prevention and redress of SHW \nand the gaps in the Act to define the role of monitoring and regulatory bodies, have \ncreated several loopholes and cracks in the redress process.\nDue to the absence or limited access to redress mechanisms, the women workers \nfrom resource poor backgrounds and the precariously positioned ones among the \ninstitutionally employed remain particularly vulnerable. \nThe SHWW Act 2013 is geared towards safety of women workforce and as such may \nbe read as gender specific, applicable to only cisgender women. However, in a \nchanging world order where notions around gender identity and expression are \nimportant markers of personhood, the Act might have to be extended in order to \nmake it inclusive of transgender persons.\n \nOpportunities\nThe legal framework for employer responsibility towards safe working environment \nis enshrined in the Constitution of India which provides the basic opportunity for \nworking on the SHW issue.\nThe landmark Vishaka Guidelines and the SHWW Act provide a comprehensive \ndefinition of SHW and include all kinds of women at workplaces under its ambit. The \nAct places the onus for safe workplaces on the employer and provides the aggrieved \nwoman recourse to civil proceeding alongside existing criminal proceeding.\nThe scope for addressing and working on the SHW issue expanded manifold when \nthe issue took centre stage in 2018 because of the # Me too movement and brought \nrenewed focus to the prevalent cultures within organizations that perpetuate SHW \nand victimize women.\nWith regard to the issue of SHW, the legal landscape in India has been a constantly \nevolving one and has led to progressive judgements of Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court and \nHigh Court leading to organisations across sectors reviewing their compliance to \nthe Act. The scope for work increased by inclusion of SHW in the various service \nrules and in the Section 29 (d) of Code on Wages, 2019 and Section 134 of \nCompanies Act, 2013 which mandated compliances through service rules among \nothers.", "7.

While the government has introduced flagship welfare \nschemes through the tea board and introduced bills such as Plantation Labor \nAct (1951), poor implementation hasn\u2019t improved conditions. In this context, \nSwaniti aims to work closely with the network of civil society organizations, \ndistrict administration, and state government to operationalize core welfare \nprograms for tea garden workers. For example, all tea garden workers should \nhave access to adequate housing. However, most local administration does not \nadhere to even the basic standards of housing. Lack of governance overview has \nled to the deprivation of this key group. In this context, Swaniti and it's partners \nproposes to embed teams into each affected district and state government to \nwork with the local ecosystem and ensure the delivery of programs. The team \nwill be expected to come up with joint solutions and implement them with the \nsupport of the local administration. By the end of the program, tea garden \nworkers will be expected to have access to public programs.", "4. GEOGRAPHY": "5.List the major countries where your activities take place. If this is global \npolicy work, list as worldwide:\nIndia  (South Asia)", "5. ORGANISATION CONTEXT": "6. Context (The context section should not exceed two pages.)\n6a. Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, \ngovernance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nSwaniti was founded in 2012 with the goal of strengthening governance tools. We \nbelieve that if public services are accessible and inclusive to the most vulnerable \nthen they will have an opportunity to grow and thrive with equal opportunity. With \nthis in mind, Bhattacharya founded Swaniti by supporting Parliamentarians and \ndistrict administration through key knowledge insights. Bhattacharya drew from \nher experience of interning at Senator\u2019s offices. She eventually received a \nMaster\u2019s in Public Policy from Harvard Kennedy School and joined the World \nBank. The founding of Swaniti has been an accumulation of her experiences in \nworking in the governance space. Today, the Swaniti board consists of similarly \npassionate individuals including Richard Rossow (India Chair at Center for \nStrategic and International Studies), Elizabeth Gamino (development professional \nand advocate on equal rights), and Shantanu Agarwal (Venture Capitalist working \non climate and sustainability technologies). Subsequently, Swaniti\u2019s senior \nleadership also brings in similar experiences and commitment to government. Our \nleadership has significant experience in public service with tremendous insights \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20135\ninto challenges on the ground. For example, our COO comes with experience from \nNITI Ayog where he was part of the evaluations team. Similarly, our program leads \nbring in the experiences from institutions such as the Ministry of Planning (central \ngovernment), the Department of industries (Andhra government) and the \nMonitoring Project Management Unit (Ranchi district). Given that Swaniti aims to \nimprove local governance in public service delivery, we maintain a decentralized \nmodel of placing team members within the community to better understand and \ndeliver on programs. Team members placed with state governments come from \ngrassroots background but are expected to maintain strong communication skills. \nFor example, we have onboarded Aspirational District Fellows who have \ndemonstrated strong verbal and written skills through the recruitment process. \nThese team members come in with 5-7 years of work experience and advanced \ndegrees. We have found such professionals to bring in the emotional intelligence \nto manage community based roles. All team members are expected to connect with \ncommunity members, civil society partners, and government stakeholders to \nensure that they have the whole picture and their contribution. Swaniti combines a \ntop-down and bottom-up approach: our senior leadership connects with all mid-\nlevel and junior associates on a bi-monthly basis to get their insight on projects \nand their experiences. Based on this feedback we design or iterate projects. This is \ncoupled with our impact evaluation and talent management team also connecting \nwith them.For this project, Swaniti plans on leveraging our previous experiences \nto ensure strong team design and program implementation.\n6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\nSwaniti is a non-profit entity with seventy percent of its funding coming from \nfoundations such as Climateworks, McArthur, and Ford Foundation. And the \nremaining thirty percent is through government partnerships. When working with \nFoundations, Swaniti works in a tri-partite model where we provide technical \nassistance to state governments with their cooperation while we are being funded \nby a foundation partner to accomplish specific outcomes. Our annual operating \nbudget for 2021-22 is at 3.5 million USD as we continue to expand our work across \nstates and districts. Our biggest partners include UNICEF, SED Fund, and Laudes \nFoundation. With the exception of the upcoming grant from National Democratic \nInstitute, all our grants our focused on work within India. Swaniti\u2019s fundraising \nstrategy is to focus on multi-year state programs where we hope to focus on two \nareas of development: a.) economic response to climate change and b.) social \nprotection for vulnerable populations across India. Using our corpus which is \nsupport by Skoll Foundation, Swaniti is continuing its work with legislators and \npolicymakers. In the upcoming years, Swaniti is currently in conversation with \nBloomberg Philanthropies and Children\u2019s Investment Fund for projects in India \nand Bangladesh.\nSwaniti recognizes that as we scale up, it is important to have in place partners \nwho can support us in our work in India. In order to strengthen Swaniti systems \nfurther, we plan on partnering with reputed organizations who can continue to be \nkey partners on programs. These partners would be FCRA-compliant and include \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\nthe likes of Digital Empowerment Foundation and UN Women. Swaniti expects \nthese agencies to not just be alligned programmatically but also have regional \npresence in states where it is working, including in West Bengal. Through \nprograms such as the proposed project of the Oak Foundation, we hope to uncover \norganizations who have alignment with Swaniti's mission, to ensure that programs \nare codesigned and executed smoothly. We believe that this would allow for our \noverall systems and programs to be strengthened. Thus we are particularly excited \nabout the Oak proposal since it is providing us the opportunity to build on the \nabove mentioned model. As we continue to scale Swaniti's growth, we hope to be \nable to establish strong partners and work in India. \n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nSwaniti Initiative aims to deliver public services to the poorest of the poor by \nstrengthening governance. Swaniti is a 501(c)3 with a team size of over 100+ \nprofessionals. In the past, we have worked in states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, \nOdisha, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. In the process, we have been \nable to establish direct advisory support to Chief Minister\u2019s offices in \nChhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Assam, and Meghalaya. Swaniti team constantly \nmonitors our policy impact on the ground. We do so by developing detailed \nlogframes with output, outcomes and impact indicators to tangibly measure the \nimpact of our work. We have seen that our interventions have established inclusive \nsystems and processes for the most most vulnerable in government policies. In \nAndhra Pradesh, for example, Swaniti Initiative has been able to significantly \nimprove last mile delivery of MGNREGS by reducing payment errors by \napproximately 90%. In Jharkhand, the team has been able to mobilise public \nfinances to enable the transition towards a green ecosystem in the state by \nuntapping high amounts of public finance. Interventions undertaken include \ninstallation of solar rooftops in government buildings, provision of EV vehicles to \nANM workers for effective last mile delivery of healthcare, employment generation \nand increased incomes through solar pumps etc. These are just some of the \nsystemic and process changes that have worked on. To accomplish the goal \nmentioned above, Swaniti has had the opportunity to partner with established \ninstitutions like World Economic Forum, Harvard University, and the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies. Through our ten-year experience, we have \nbeen able to mobilize over 5 million dollars of untapped funding and impacted over \n300,000 lives. We have been acknowledged for our exceptional work by \npublications like Forbes (30 under 30 lists for work with Swaniti), Fortune (40 \nunder 40 lists), World Economic Forum (as Young Global Leader), Special Invitee \nto the White House, and Australia \u2013 India Youth Dialogue Young Leader.Swaniti\u2019s \nwork has been featured in national and international publications including Indian \nExpress, Times of India, Hindustan Times, Reuters, and NPR.\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nKey to Swaniti\u2019s strategy in the next five years is to work in a collaborative model. \nSpecifically, Swaniti plans on building on its current cross-sectoral model of \nworking with multiple stakeholders to ensure policy and implementation change in \ngovernance. Swaniti sees the role of the government as being catalytic in serving \nthe community. However, to be sustainable and scalable, programs need to engage \nwith communities and bring together local partners for successful execution. \nAccordingly, Swaniti pursues a triangular model of collaboration in overall service \ndelivery. The three key stakeholders who maintain a symbiotic relationship are as \nfollows:   The community is our primary stakeholder. To make a program \nsustainable it is important to ensure that the program is deeply rooted within the \nrequirements and expectations of the community. Therefore, the field teams begin \nall engagements by holding community-level meetings with key stakeholders like \nvillage council members, women\u2019s self-help groups, small landholding farmers, etc. \nOnly with key input from community members does the program design move \nforward. The field teams invest several months to build trust within the \ncommunities and understand gaps and opportunities in public service delivery.  As \nhighlighted above, the government is a key collaborator. Swaniti embeds itself in \nthe office of the local administration to ensure the requisite support systems for \nservice delivery exists and complements it with counterparts in state offices to \nensure scalability. Swaniti sees government as a critical level in ensuring the \ndelivery of key social safety programs that can lift people out of poverty and \nprovide them with an opportunity for better quality of life. Our government \ncounterparts are a critical part of Swaniti's work. Finally, partnerships of local \nNGO partners who can help in program implementation are a key part of the \nprogram. NGOs bring in critical insights on how to operationalize local solutions \nwithin the communities and our seen as the \"local solution providers\". In this \nparticular program, we hope to partner with the Digital Empowerment Foundation \nwho would be bringing in their \"Soochnaprenuers\", community members who have \na thorough understanding of local programs and will help tea garden workers \nenroll in various government initiatives. Soochnaprenuers is a program piloted and \nscaled by DEF. The local entreprenuers, known as Soochnaprenuers, will bring in \nthe hyperlocal solutions needed to resolve the current knowledge and enrollment \ngaps of various government programs. \nOur past experience has shown that this is the most impactful model and therefore \ngoing forward we are focusing on the same for our current strategy.  \n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nIndia\u2019s local governance systems are broken. This makes it difficult for the most \nvulnerable to have access to basic public services that are critical to growth. 78 \nmillion people are eligible for government-funded programs. The Indian \ngovernment spends over 58 billion USD on ensuring food security 42 billion on \ncreating economic opportunities, and over 126 billion on social protection \nprograms. Yet India is home to 20 percent of the world\u2019s poor who are living in \nabject poverty. Despite the government\u2019s will to lift people out of poverty, many \nfall through the cracks because local administrations often don\u2019t have the tools for \nlast-mile delivery.\n Local governments lack the three Ps...\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\n                     ...skilled people at a local level who have the knowledge, expertise, \nand drive to effectively execute and reach most marginalized\n              \u2026.meaningful civil society partnerships to complement the government \nefforts and create checks and balances for robust long term program delivery\n                \u2026.strong processes which include continuous monitoring and \nevaluation.  \nMost governance-centric efforts are concentrated at a national level. The weakest \nstates, districts, and villages often have little or no tools to improve local \ngovernance. Yet local governments are the touch points for public services. To \ncorrect this imbalance, it is critical to work with government administrators at a \nlocal level in weak and laggard districts and states. This proposal focuses on \nworking with local governance to be able to solve issues around social protection \nfor tea garden workers.\n \nBased on the consultations with grassroots organizations, we learned that there is \nno role of middlemen/contractors in the hiring of the tea workers. The hiring \nhappens through heredity. For instance, the original person who was hired \nprovides replacement through some family member and the cycle goes on. Office \nstaff are interviewed by the DBITA (Dooars Branch Indian Tea Association). Tea \nworkers lack the required documentation for most schemes and programs. \nWorkers don't have aadhar cards or bank accounts. However, even with an \nalternate id proof (if any), the process is very cumbersome in accessing programs \nlike maternity benefit scheme. Even RTE is defunct for the tea workers. Paralegals \nare trained how to acquire the relevant forms etc but implementation hurdles limit \npossible impact levels. \nThe impact of access to scheme is ultimately seen in developmental outcomes. \nThese include multilayered challenges in the form of health, sanitation etc. \nFollowing aare some of the outcome challenges within the state:\n1. Severely compromised health infrastructure included limited doctors and \nmedicines. \n2. Tea workers do not have access to entitled ration\n3. Sanitation, housing and drinking water are big challenges.\n4. Separate electricity meters in the living quarters and the electricity bill is borne \nby the workers.\n \nThus with these outcomes and broken governance systems, it is important to help \nstrengthen the process of public service delivery of tea garden workers. Through \nthis proposal, Swaniti hopes to address this issue.", "7. OBJECTIVES": "7. Objectives (maximum 2,200 words)\nFor a core support grant, state the purpose of this grant request and complete the \nobjectives.  After consultations with an Oak PO, you may decide to summarise your \nmission as one broad objective.

(You may use additional space if you have more than three objectives)?. \nUnder each objective describe the activities that your organisation will undertake to \nachieve it, including time frame and the results or outcomes you expect to achieve.\n7.1.a. Objective 1 (maximum one sentence):\nTo identify the availability and extent of accessibility of tea workers to government \nwelfare schemes and other entitlements\n7.1.b. Objective 1\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\nThe output would include recommendations on ways to improve access to schemes \nwhile also generating livelihood opportunities. From this exploratory study, we \nhope to understand the dynamism and challenges faced by the tea workers in their \necosystem in terms of their access to social security entitlements such that an \nimplementable and sustainable policy recommendation can be designed. The \nexercise will be built on the existing research studies that focus on the tea garden \nworker community and their vulnerability in terms of access to their entitlements. \nInsights from existing research studies such as Bhowmick (1982,1992, 2011, \n2015), Sadhukhan (2014), Ghosh (2014), Thakur (1995) etc will serve as the base \nfor the project.\nTo meet the objective, the Swaniti team and it's partner will be performing the \nfollowing set of activities:\n\u2022Conducting FGDs with constituents, semi-structured interviews, and \nhousehold surveys on various socio-economic-infrastructural indicators to \nachieve an in-depth understanding of the on-ground situation.\n\u2022The findings from the field will then be substantiated by engaging with \nvarious stakeholders from different spheres, including government, civil \nsociety organizations, and grassroots partners to leverage their knowledge \nof institutional and local enforcement challenges and to identify needs for \ninstitutional capacity building. The Swaniti team would also conduct a pilot \nsurvey for the questionnaire testing before rolling out the final survey.\n\u2022Based on the survey findings and stakeholder consultations, the Swaniti \nteam will then also map out the government processes and bottlenecks in \nprogram delivery.\n\u2022Since tea plantations fall under the agrarian economy it is likely that tea \nworkers have limited or no exposure to modern skill development training \nor technology. Accordingly, Swaniti will leverage the expertise that it has \ngathered through its experience in the RESET (Roadmap for Ecological and \nSustainable Energy Transformation) project in Jharkhand in employment \ngeneration and apply them for West Bengal.\n \nThe indicators for skill identification will include:\n\u2022Number of skill development workshops conducted\n\u2022Number of workers trained; the number of alternate jobs generated\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201310\n7.1.c.

In this phase, the fieldwork will begin with data \ncollection in at least three districts, namely Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Cooch \nBehar. Swaniti team proposes to carry out data collection in four tea estates within \neach district where the estates will be decided based on the following indicators:\n\u2022Estate Size: STGs and Large estates\n\u2022Status of the estate: profit-making closed tea estate\n\u2022Number of currently employed tea workers\n \nSwaniti will also be interviewing retired tea workers. The prospective theme for \ndata collection will comprise but not be limited to:\n\u2022household details (education/ nutrition statistics for children; number of \ndependents etc)\n\u2022socio-economic status\n\u2022awareness and access to schemes and entitlements\n\u2022details about working conditions\n\u2022major challenges etc\n \nThe primary study participants will include tea workers, we have found that and \nestate owners/managers. Secondary stakeholders include worker trade unions, \nnearby SHGs, Panchayat, etc. We have done an inter-district comparison between \nJalpaiguri and Kooch Behar in terms of socio-economic indicators including sex \nratio. The final sex ratio will be decided once the sampling strategy is finalized. \nHowever, as per our standard practice, we aim to keep an equal composition of \nmen and women in FGDs. Additionally, Swaniti team will also engage in \nconsultation with stakeholders including the government, field partners, like-\nminded CSOs, and grassroots organizations. Digital Empowerment Foundation \n(DEF) will be supported Swaniti to design the survey by leveraging their past \nexperience of working with team garden workers in Assam. Additionally, they will \nexpect to mobilize young people from the ground to support conducting these \nsurveys, with the hopes that these youth can eventually become Soochnaprenuers \nand help inform tea garden workers about their rights and ways to access them. \nDEF will build on its Soochnaprenuer model from other districts and states. \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201311\nbottlenecks in the delivery of public programs b.) and; surveying and interviewing \nconstituents to recognize limitations and opportunities.The primary study \nparticipants will include tea workers and estate owners/managers. Secondary \nstakeholders include worker trade unions, nearby SHGs, Panchayat, etc. \nAdditionally, the Swaniti team will also engage in consultation with stakeholders \nincluding the government, field partners, like-minded CSOs, and grassroots \norganizations.\n \nData will be collected through the following methods:( Phase 1: 3-4 months)\n\u2022Focus group discussions: Within each tea estate, the Swaniti Initiative team \nwill conduct 1 FGD with a cohort of 10-15 people each. Beneficiaries will be \nsampled through purposive sampling in consultation with our on-ground \npartners. Further, the team will ensure that each focus group discussion \nconsists of a diverse range of beneficiaries including women, tribal/ SC \npopulation, and contractual/ permanent employees. We expect that the \nprimary resistance to enter the estate and communicate with the workers \nwill in fact come from the garden owners. In order to counter this, we are \nworking on a separate risk and mitigating strategy that involves working \nwith various tea councils and the Ministry of Commerce\u2019s cooperation with \nthe Tea Board.\n\u2022Household surveys: Apart from the focus group discussions, in order to gain \na thorough understanding of the situation on-ground and to begin \ndeveloping a baseline, the Swaniti Initiative team will conduct household \nsurveys in each estate. Households will be selected through snowball \nsampling. Data will be collected on various indicators including current \nsocio-economic conditions, access to schemes, challenges being faced, etc. \nThe sets of entitlement to the workers come from two broad sources. (i) \nFlagship schemes of the government through Tea Board and State \ngovernment (Chai Sundari) and (ii) the now-dissolved PLA 1951 where \nunder the Act, the entitlements are the responsibility of the estate owners \nand the administering the process is the responsibility of the state \ngovernment. Through the baseline, we aim to understand the challenges to \naccessing both these.\n\u2022Semi-structured/ in-depth interviews: Apart from the data collection from \nbeneficiaries, the team will be conducting interviews with other identified \nstakeholders to substantiate its findings from the field as well as to \nunderstand the supply side of the issue.\n\u2022The outcome of this phase is to understand the major challenges being faced \nby plantation workers in accessing benefits and identify potential \ninterventions to address these issues.\nWhile the Swaniti team will be collecting data from the ground, the Digital \nEmpowerment Foundation will take this opportunity to recruit young people from \nthe community to support the on ground data collection process. These youth will \nalso have their capacity built about the rights and services that tea garden \nworkers should have access toward. In the upcoming phases of the program, the \nyouth, known as Soochnaprenuers, will be expected to help in increased \nawareness and enrollment of tea garden workers, into government programs. \n \n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201312\n7.2.a. Objective 2 (maximum one sentence):\nObjective 2 To strengthen systems and processes by collaborating with state \ndepartments and district administration and build capacity, knowledge insights, etc. \nof local officers to ensure tractable public program delivery by identifying \ninterventions suited for the local context.\n7.2.c. Objective 2\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\nIn this phase of the project to achieve the second objective, Swaniti will work with \nthe district and state administration in providing program implementation support. \nSystems and processes strengthening and capacity building can be achieved by:\n\u2022Providing Technical Assistance to the Government: Swaniti team will \ndeploy three fellows to work with the District Magistrates office and one \nstate coordinator will be deployed to work with a nodal department. These \nresources will translate the working module of the recommendations into a \ncontinued government mechanism.\n\u2022Training and Capacity Building: To ensure that the project will keep \nrunning even after Swaniti\u2019s tenure is over and in the absence of continuous \ninvolvement of on-ground partners, Swaniti will ensure that the local \nadministration is trained for sustainable implementation of the \nrecommendations. Swaniti team and it's partners, Digital Empowerment \nFoundation, will also aim to bridge the gap between the government and the \ncommunity. This is important because, without this connection, there will be \nno advantage of proximity which can exploit transparent communication \noptimally. Hence, despite implementing the recommendations, there will \nalways remain a gap between the beneficiaries\u2019 lack of entitlement and /or \naccess to the same and the government\u2019s attempt to solve the same. In this \n7.2.b. Objective 2\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\nIn this part of the project, the set of actionable policy recommendations will be \nimplemented thus initiating Phase II of the project. The second phase will be for a \nperiod of 12 months. The outcome of this phase would be to develop an overall set \nof sustainable policy frameworks containing a set of actionable recommendations \nand intervention strategies and implement the same at the administrative level to \nstrengthen the governance of service delivery which will, in turn, enhance tea \nworkers\u2019 access to public programs. Accordingly, the Swaniti team seeks to \nengage with multiple stakeholders including:\nThe broader outcomes of this phase are: \n\u2022Recommendations have been adopted by the department\n\u2022Reports/ findings/ recommendations have been submitted to the department\n\u2022New departments have been onboarded\n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201313\nrespect, the training of government officials will be based on the statement \nof purpose (SoP) of the recommendations which can be process \ncorrection/new schemes/increasing budget allocation of existing schemes, \netc. This training can be done for example by conducting capacity-building \nworkshops. The community, on the other hand, will be trained by the \nSoochnaprenuers who are recruited and onboarded by the Digital \nEmpowerment Foundation. These entreprenuers will be working closely \nwith the DEF team members to organize the most effective structure of \ncommunity engagement and will be working with them to be able to setup \nthese meetings. Additionally, through the previous phase, we would be able \nto gain significant data on eligible schemes and programs for tea garden \nworkers and Soochnaprenuers would be able to gain from this knowledge \nand disseminate it in the community. \n\u2022Pilot Testing Interventions: Swaniti will support the government to pilot-\ntest the interventions in the selected baseline geographies in order to \nunderstand the efficacy of the project. Based on the outcomes the capacity \nbuilding can be updated as a part of the upscaling and course correction \nprocess.\n\u2022Further, there will be an advisory committee that would include subject \nmatter and sector experts who will assist in vetting Swaniti\u2019s \nrecommendations. This advisory committee will be introduced to the \ngovernment by Swaniti where their role and importance will be explained.\n7.3.a. Objective 3 (maximum one sentence):\nObjective 3: To establish a strong bottom-up policy framework that can be scaled \nacross the State for larger policy adoption\n7.3.b. Objective 3\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\nThe outcome of this phase is to create a local ecosystem of accountability and \noversight by connecting civil society partners with government agencies to ensure \nthe sustainability of the program. Swaniti will facilitate such that local NGOs hold \nperiodical meetings with the district magistrates and provide him/her with \ncontinuous insights, state of conditions, and solutions about the tea garden \nworkers. Additionally, the presence of local youth, Soochnaprenuers, who would \nbe expected to continue supporting tea garden workers, will also ensure the \nsustainability of the program.   The Soochnapreneur model has volunteers who \nhave door-to-door access to beneficiaries. The total number of such volunteers will \nbe decided at a block level during the mid-term stage of the program once the first \nphase of adoption or implementation starts. One may consider this model very \nsimilar to a CSC ( Common service center) hub and spook ecosystem or a Banking \nCorrespondent setup.\nSince we are collaborating with the Soochnapreneur program, we will be \nleveraging their model to ensure there is no exclusion such that the program is \nsustainable.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201314\n7.3.c. Objective 3\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\n\u2022Sharing the SoP of Recommendations with Sectoral Experts: Swaniti \nwill assist in conducting high-level meetings with sectoral experts, \nbureaucrats etc where the SoP of the recommendations can be revisited and \nbrainstormed on to obtain specialized insights on improving inclusivity and \nsustainability. The last two months in the final phase of the project can be \ndedicated for impact assessment to understand the sustainability of the \nThe intent would be to institutionalize a culture of engagement of civil society with \nthe government. Through this project, Swaniti aims to not just aid in short-term \nprogram delivery but also hope to create long-term systems.\n\u2022The medium-term output would be measured by: \noThe increase in access and uptake of schemes and entitlements can \nbe measured by the percentage of beneficiaries registering for and/or \nregistered beneficiaries accessing the entitlements.  This can be \nverified with government data/surveys.\noA number of changes are institutionalized within the governance \nsystems and local ecosystem. This is only possible with a robust \nmonitoring system created through the local civil society ecosystem. \nThis component will focus on translating the recommendations and \nsolutions as part of \u201cgovernment functioning\u201d. For example, the \nadministration might implement systems to ease the enrollment of tea \ngarden workers into various programs. This can be a permanent \nchange that should be implemented at a district level.  In order to \nensure the long-term sustainability of our interventions, Swaniti \nInitiative ensures the capacity building of government officials and \nrelevant stakeholders. Grievance redressal and timely monitoring of \ninterventions are a part of this training. This is done by establishing a \nstrong communication channel and feedback loop between the district \nand state teams of Swaniti who form a point of bridge between these \ntwo administrative bodies. In Andhra Pradesh, Swaniti Initiative has \nsuccessfully demonstrated this model where due to our intervention \nthe grievances recorded have jumped from 25 complaints a month to \n125 a month for the MGNREGS scheme due to our systems that have \nbeen adopted by the Dept of RD and PR.\n\u2022The long term output would be measured by:\nChange in the socio-economic parameters of the beneficiaries. This can be \nmeasured by recording the change in income, socio-economic indicators like \nhealth, education, nutrition, access to safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, \nhousing, etc, through government data or surveys. In short, the long-term \nexpected outcome would be an improvement in the quality of life of the \nbeneficiaries. Swaniti Initiative will develop a log frame identifying outputs (short \nterm), outcomes (midterm), and impact (long term). The short-term indicators \nwould measure factors like awareness levels, documentation for accessing \nentitlements, etc. The projected timeline to witness this is 7-8 months. In the \nmedium term, the outcomes measured will include percentage increase in \nbeneficiaries, uptake of schemes, etc. We predict approximately 12-16 months to \nwitness this change. In the long term, Swaniti envisages better socio-economic \nindicators for the beneficiaries. This will be measured at the end of the project, but \nit might take longer than 2 years to witness the tangible socio-economic impact. \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201315\nproject.\n\u2022Monitoring and Evaluation: Swaniti will work closely with local partners \nto develop a culture of periodic \u201cinformation sharing\u201d with the local and \nstate administration by sharing real-time data assessment on the \nperformance and feedback on grievances. Having a continuous monitoring \nsystem would provide the government with a ground perspective on the \nstate of rights and services of tea garden workers and open up an active \ndiscussion with the government.\n\u2022Establish a Continuous Feedback Mechanism: to enable beneficiary \ninputs at every stage of the project by leveraging our on-field network of \npartner organisations, district associates, and the state lead. In this phase. \nSwaniti will also focus on community engagements. The field partners will \nplay an important role as advisors in communicating the community \nfeedback to the government to foster a culture of dialogue on public service \ndelivery and eventually scale up the project presence. It is critical to take a \nconstructive tone to ensure that these conversations are fruitful and \nsustainable. Thus, Swaniti will be leveraging its experience from other \nprojects to ensure that this is the case in West Bengal.  Additionally, state \nand district fellows will analyze how community actors and government can \ndevelop a continuous feedback and course correction loop to ensure that tea \ngarden workers continue to receive basic rights. For example, convening \nmonthly meetings where civil society members can share key data points \nabout how tea garden workers are performing. The convening will hope to \nnudge conversation about the continued gaps and possible solutions in \npublic programs. This will also feed into the monitoring and evaluation \nprocess. This stage is expected to overlap with Phase II. The Civil society \nagencies can be our \u201ceyes and ears on the ground\u201d and provide critical \nfeedback to the administration about their functioning of key programs. This \ncan be strengthened through the development of a dashboard.", "8. COOPERATION": "8. Cooperation\nDescribe the level of cooperation with other organisations and networks \nand explain how this cooperation helps achieve your goals (maximum 300 \nwords):\nSwaniti has been continuously engaging with grassroots organizations like \nNazdeek, Traidcraft, and the Family Planning Association of India. These \norganizations work with marginalized communities and have helped us to \nrefine our proposal based on their on-ground insights. The organizations have \nprovided deeper insights on violation of rights and institutional and local \nenforcement challenges to policy implementation. Cooperating with these \norganizations has highlighted issues that not only reveal violations of tea \nworkers\u2019 rights to social security but also identify implementation problems \nthat require immediate attention. These findings include (1) since PLA is the \nemployer's responsibility the local governments (PRIs) have moved away from \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201316\nassuming any responsibility for the welfare of tea workers despite being \nincluded in schedule 6. Also, it remains unimplemented in West Bengal; (2) \nmost tea workers are from Oraon community but not included in ST list and \nhence have no access to public programs; (3) tea workers have no access to \nschemes like PM Kisan which are applicable to farming programs; (4) absence \nof labour commissioners and hence unsettled disputes related to employer\u2019s \nprovident fund persist; (5) although 50% to 60% of tea workers are women, \nthere is a huge lack of organization bodies for women representation and they \nare not allowed to form SHGs; (6) high rates of school dropout, child labour \nwhere children are remunerated based on per kilo lifting basis; (7) tea workers \nare not allowed to migrate unless they provide replacement from family; (8) \nsignificant lack of accountability as there is a lack of audit certification for \nmost tea estates as owners don't allow audits; (9) there is a nexus between \nestate owners and local administration where owners register for MNREGA \nwith false promise of providing 100 days\u2019 work to tea workers and obtain the \nfunds without actual employment. Cooperating with this network of \norganizations, can help us understand the tea workers ecosystem and \nchallenges better and hence create targeted policy interventions that can be \nimplemented to strengthen governance for the delivery of welfare entitlements \nto the tea workers community.\nIn addition to working with these organizations, Swaniti also plans on \npartnering with Digital Empowerment Foundation. Digital Empowerment \nFoundation has worked  with tea garden workers in Assam in increasing \naccess to government programs. With a budget spent of 22 crores annually \n(approximately 3 million USD), Digital Empowerment Foundation has previous \nexperience of working on large scale programs. We hope to be able to build on \ntheir experiences of working with tea garden workers and bring in ours of \nworking with government. The partnership will allow for a strong program \ndelivery. With DEF being a FCRA-compliant, we hope to provide a sub-grant to \nthem through this program and have a programmatic partnership. We are in \nthe process of finalizing the above (and have provided a tentative budget based \non discussions thus far). We plan on submitting the details of finalized roles \nand responsibilities to Oak Foundation team members in the next month.", "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. Impact\nWhat is the change you want to achieve from the overall project? (maximum \n300 words):\nGiven the distressed background of tea workers, the goal of this project is to \nstrengthen the delivery of government programs to tea garden workers. In this \nrespect, first, Swaniti aims to improve the delivery of public programs to tea garden \nworkers by translating the set of recommendations to government functioning. The \nprimary focus of this impact of the project is to create a sustainable program \ndelivery change to secure the social rights and entitlements and access to \ngovernment programs by strengthening implementation. For instance, through this \nproject as the gaps and challenges in accessibility and provision of tea workers\u2019 \nentitlements and reasons for the same are identified, Swaniti aims to highlight \nwhether there is (a) complete absence of some socio-economic entitlements; (b) \ndifficulty in access to the same; (c) impediments in the delivery mechanism at the \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201317\nadministration level which requires process correction, etc. Following the \nidentification, Swaniti will work with the administration and other stakeholders in \ncorrecting the loopholes. For instance, if the main obstacle is administrative process \nimpediment, Swaniti with work in tandem with the administration with the help of \nthe district and state fellows to correct the same. Further, to achieve sustainable \nadoption of the recommendations, Swaniti will work towards utilization of funds \nfrom the Government's side. We would ensure that the policy recommendations that \nget adopted will have a separate budget head or mobilize the government to allocate \nunder-utilized funds that make the program institutionalized. The second impact \nSwaniti aims to achieve is to create a local ecosystem of accountability. Swaniti aims \nto achieve this impact by engaging the community with civil society partners and \ngrassroots organizations through regular sessions where the tea workers can \nupdate their existing conditions and whether there has been any tangible change. \nThis feedbacks will then go to the government through the civil society members to \ncreate a continuous feedback and correction mechanism which will ensure the \nsustainability of the program.\n10. Evaluation\nHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):\nFor evaluation, a monthly monitoring system will be put in place in the form of an \nexcel tracker the team leads or a person appointed by the lead will update the \nmonthly deliverables at the beginning of each month. At the month-end, the \ntracker will be updated with the actual outputs. This will enable us to map the \nmonthly deliverables with the actual progress. The tracker will also note the \nreasons for being unable to achieve the monthly deliverables, the challenges faced, \nmitigation strategy to ensure a course-correction mechanism. This includes \ngathering insights on the process being followed, external and internal challenges \nfaced as a team, and feedback to make the process more effective and efficient. \nProcess monitoring will be further substantiated by a quarterly HR review, \nconducted through anonymous surveys. All team members will fill in their \nresponses, to track their views on challenges being faced and means to improve on \nthe project. Problems of a severe nature can be addressed by the HR/project lead, \nas convenient. This will provide a space for the individual team members to \nprovide their views on the workings of the project. Apart from these, the M&E \nteam will also carry out spot checks and back-checks to ensure the quality of data \nbeing collected. For impact assessment, every 6 months, there will be a medium-\nterm outcome evaluation report which will assess if the targeted outputs have \nbeen achieved or not as per the pre-defined project design and goals. At the end of \nthe project, a broader impact assessment will be carried out which along with \noutcome evaluation, will also assess the impact of the project on the lives of \nbeneficiaries/key stakeholders/change in governance mechanisms, etc. through a \npre-post assessment methodology. In addition to this Swaniti Initiative follows the \nrecommended 2-5% allocation for MEL activities. This is a best practice based on \nDevelopment Assistance Committee (DAC) recommendations for OECD. Just to \nexplain this in a bit more detail, Swaniti Initiative will follow a pre-post \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201318\nmethodology to measure outputs, outcome, and impact. Our internal Evaluation \nframework comprises 4 key performance indicators centers around systems and \nprocesses, bottom-up planning, capacity building, and mobilizing public finance for \nkey welfare programs. Apart from these, the team in collaboration with the \nrelevant stakeholders and will develop a detailed log frame to identify project-\nspecific output and outcome indicators and the ways of measuring the same.", "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11. Future Plans\nHow will the grant influence the organisation and future plans? (maximum \n300 words):\nAs mentioned in the previous section, this project is part of Swaniti\u2019s larger goal of \nbeing able to create models of effective implementation in social welfare programs \nat the state level. Having \u201cmodels of excellence\u201d will allow creating a national \nprogram for countrywide improvement since we would be able to showcase the \nsteps taken for more inclusive and accessible government schemes and programs. \nThe focus of this program being rights and entitlements of tea garden workers \nwould help create one such intervention that can be showcased to NITI, PMO, and \nother state governments for larger adoptions. Swaniti will hope to take the \nlearning from this particular condition to other districts and states and provide \npointed feedback on how to bring systemic change. We have already initiated \nmany of these practices. For example, we are bringing our experiences of working \non job creation in Jharkhand to West Bengal.

Even though \nyou may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the \nproposed grant. (300 words)\nWater For People began working in India in 1996 in North 24 Parganas in \nWest Bengal. In 2008, we established a locally registered arm governed by \nan eight-member board, Water For People India Trust. Since 2011, we have \napplied the Everyone Forever model, a long-term approach focused on \nsustainable water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services. \nApplying our Everyone Forever model, with its emphasis on partnerships \nwith local governments and communities, has resulted in significant progress \ntowards the completion and rehabilitation of improved water and sanitation \nsystems, strengthened by municipal and local structures. This transformative \nWASH program in India is helping Everyone \u2013 every community, household, \nschool, and clinic \u2013 gain access to these critical resources across 10 \ndistricts/blocks in West Bengal in South 24 Parganas (Sagar Island, \nOak Application Form     6\nPatharpratima, Namkhana) and Birbhum (Rajnagar), in Bihar, Sheohar \n(Sheohar block, Dumri Katsari, Piprahi, Traini Chowk, and Purnahiya), and in \nMaharashtra, Amravati (Chikhaldara). Eight districts/blocks now have new or \nimproved water services in all communities, the five blocks of Sheohar \n(Bihar), Sagar Island, Patharpratima, and Rajnagar (West Bengal) and seven \nhave new or improved water services in all households, including \nPatharpratima.  \nThese efforts have resulted in intermediate or high levels of water services \nfor 1,548,915 people across 10 Everyone Forever districts/blocks, affecting \n93% of the population in these blocks. These areas include five blocks in \nSheohar (Bihar), Chikhaldara block in Amravati (Maharashtra), and four \nblocks in West Bengal. \nWater For People and Panchayat and Rural Development Department \n(Governments of West Bengal and Bihar) have signed Memorandum of \nUnderstandings in which Water For People formed a Technical Support Unit \nwith embedded staff to assist government flagship programs such as Jal \nJeevan Mission. The Unit provides support to these departments for \ncommunity engagement, program management, capacity building and \ntraining of state, district, and local level officials. This support aims to assist \nthese states to achieve the ambitious goals of the Jal Jeevan Mission (a \nfunctional household water tap connection to all households in rural India by \n2024), SBM Phase II, and Jal Shakti Abhiyan (water conservation \ninitiative). This Unit also works with communities to develop plans and \nmodels to manage their water resources.  \nWater resources in the areas where we work in India are severely affected \nby climate change. There are more frequent tropical storms, sea levels are \nrising, and drought persists. Erratic rainfall, changes in timing, intensity and \nduration of precipitation has adversely affected surface water, putting \nadditional pressure on ground water resources. Water For People India \naligns its water resources management (WRM) activities with the Indian \ngovernment\u2019s water conservation initiative, Jal Shakti Abhiyan\u2014Catch the \nrain when it falls where it falls. We provide training to master trainers, \nguiding them to work closely with communities and villages to develop \nclimate resilient Village Water Safety and Security Plans (VWSSPs). These \nplans include budgets for conducting water quality testing, measuring water \nsources, and planning availability. Under these plans, Water for People \nsupports the installation of aquifer storage units, ridge and furrow models, \nand creation of recharge pits for surface water management. VWSSPs are \nincorporated into Gram Panchayat Development Plans. We also work with \nfarmers to reduce pumping needs for irrigation. In addition, in schools, we \ninstall roof top rainwater harvesting systems to serve as an \nalternative/supplemental water source.  \n5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? \nHow will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and \ndecide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \nOak Application Form     7\ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nWater For People is very familiar with the Sundarbans\u2019 challenges, having \nworking in Parganas, West Bengal since 1996. This area has a population of \n2.79 million living in about 1,100 villages. Most people, including many from \nscheduled tribes and castes, live in acute poverty and depend on agriculture \nfor their livelihoods. This region is very vulnerable to climate change\u2019s \nfrequent cyclones, floods, and sea-level rise. These events have led to saline \nsoil, seawater intrusion, aquifer contamination, brackish aquaculture ponds, \nand increased incidence of waterborne diseases. Progressive salinization of \nrivers and groundwater has resulted in the decline of available fresh \ndrinking water. The demand for groundwater has increased to meet \nincreasing demand for crops, which, combined with limited rainfall, is \nresulting in the over-extraction of groundwater and a severe crisis during the \nsummer.  \nBased on our experience, all activities that Water For People India carries \nout in communities related to water security aim to build resilience as part of \nthe overarching goal of communities surviving climate change. A community \ncannot survive climate change if water sources are not secure, namely \naccessible and of sufficient quantity and quality. The people contributing the \nleast to climate change are suffering the most. We cannot continue to wait \nfor mitigation efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to correct \nthe injustice.?It is time for the people directly facing threats to their water \nsources to have resources necessary to adapt.? \nWe plan to use Oak Foundation\u2019s funding to strengthen integrated water \nresources management (IWRM) in Patharpratima and Gosaba, two blocks \nwith ecosystems highly vulnerable to cyclones. In Patharpratima block, 23% \nof the population is Schedule Caste, 0.8% is Schedule Tribe. In Gosaba block, \n62.7% is Schedule Caste, 9.5% is Schedule Tribe. We will work closely with \ncommunity leaders and members, particularly those from marginalized \ngroups such as Schedule Castes and Tribes, and women.  \nThis work will empower those community leaders to lead efforts to adapt to \nclimate change by ensuring water security.?IWRM acknowledges the pivotal \nrole of water as a finite resource and advocates for its judicious allocation \nusing a comprehensive approach to address the multifaceted challenges \nposed by climate change, particularly for tribal communities. These \ncommunities are often reliant on local water sources for sustenance with \nIWRM offering enhanced water security. By implementing sustainable \npractices such as rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge, and efficient \nirrigation methods, women who traditionally bear the responsibility of water \ncollection, can experience reduced physical burden and increased access to \nclean water.  \nIWRM can also serve as an educational tool, enhancing tribal communities' \nunderstanding of hydrological processes, water conservation strategies, and \nclimate change impacts. This knowledge empowers everyone, especially \nwomen, to make informed decisions regarding water use and management, \nproducing a culture of environmental stewardship and adaptive learning. \nAlso as women are primary users of water, they are interested in learning \nOak Application Form     8\nthe scientific and social context of ground water depletion as it greatly \nimpacts their daily lives, and how to put into practice newly acquired \nknowledge for the community's benefit. \nIWRM also enhances public health through improved water quality due to \nIWRM's emphasis on monitoring water quality, pollution control, and \nwatershed management. By mitigating waterborne diseases and \ncontamination, tribal communities experience improved overall well-being \nand reduced healthcare burdens, particularly benefitting women in tribal \ncommunities through improved maternal and child health. \nFor women's empowerment, IWRM and the approaches proposed are \ninherently transformative as it involves women in decision-making processes \nrelated to water management, challenging traditional gender roles and \namplifying women's voices. Participation in water committees, resource \nplanning, and advocacy initiatives elevates their status and influence within \nthe community, nurturing a more gender-equitable society. \nIn addition, IWRM can catalyze diversification of livelihoods by integrating \nwater-sensitive agricultural practices and aquaculture. This not only \nmitigates climate risks but also stimulates economic growth within tribal \ncommunities, reducing their vulnerability to external shocks. By enhancing \nwater security, supporting education, promoting health, elevating women's \nempowerment, and augmenting livelihoods, IWRM becomes a catalyst for \ninclusive and sustainable development. \nTo strengthen IWRM, Water For People, PRASARI, and Akvo propose to build \non the tested approach of participatory groundwater management (PGWM) \nfor select villages in the Sundarbans. This approach incorporates a deep \nunderstanding of surface and groundwater interactions and values and \nincorporates community knowledge to solve complex water problems. \nSuccessful implementation of PGWM requires an understanding of \ngroundwater science from the perspective of the local population too.  \nFirstly, within the Participatory Groundwater Management (PGWM) process, \nthe community will engage in the mapping of IWRM activities and models \ncurrently in place. It is necessary to validate the traditional IWRM models \nusing scientific methods. Subsequently, this knowledge will be disseminated \nto the community through various platforms, leading to the development of a \ncomprehensive community plan focused on ensuring the sustainability of \nwater sources. As a result, the PGWM process will involve the identification \nof different categories of traditional IWRM models, with particular attention \ngiven to identifying models that have been damaged or reduced in \neffectiveness. During the execution phase, appropriate modifications will be \nmade to ineffective traditional IWRM models either with direct support or \nwith convergence from government departments.? \nWe will nurture local leaders and community-based institutions, particularly \namong women-led Self-Help Groups, supporting them to map the aquifers, \ndelineate resources, facilitate water budgeting, and scenario building for \nmanaging water. In addition, we will combine outcomes of community-based \nwater quality mapping with predictive analysis models leveraging available \nand relevant historical data for community and local institutions to make \ninformed decisions regarding the sustainability of their water sources. We \nintend to act as enablers, with local communities and their institutions \nOak Application Form     9\ndriving the process. Since PRASARI and Water For People have built trust in \ncommunities in these blocks for years, interventions will begin quickly.  \nParticipatory approaches and IWRM require investments of time and \nresources before fully realizing benefits. We will use Oak Foundation\u2019s \nfunding to design the program and activities together with the government, \ntraditional leaders from schedule castes and tribes, and local communities. \nWe will facilitate discussions between local government and communities to \nensure sustainability by creating an advisory committee that includes senior \ngovernment officials from state and district governments, local elected \nbodies, and Panchayati Raj Institution members. We will involve traditional \nleaders, developing a cadre of communities to build their capacity to plan, \nbudget, and develop demonstration of freshwater harvesting and aquifer \nrecharging models for three years. After the close of the initial project, we \nwill build on investments and link communities to government campaigns/ \nresources to fund water security plans and infrastructure solutions. As Water \nFor People is embedded in the West Bengal state government, we will foster \nincorporating water security plans into Gram Panchayat Development Plans \n(GPDPs).  \nIn addition to incorporating these plans in GPDPs, locally elected bodies and \nPanchayati Raj Institution members will play an important role in decision \nmaking to leverage government resources. From project inception to \ncapacity building exercises and workshops to develop community-led water \nsecurity plans and solutions, vulnerable community members, traditional \nleaders, and locally elected bodies will participate in every stage. We will \nensure regular communication among all stakeholders and jointly celebrate \nsuccesses. By aligning water security plans with existing government \nschemes (Jal Jeevan Mission) and programs, we will also facilitate efforts to \nensure that community institutions and their representatives receive \ngovernment acknowledgement to access water security financing. \nWithin communities, we will apply Elinor Ostrom\u2019s principles to strengthen \ncommunity-based institutions. We recognize that based on data collected and \nanalyzed, these principles may be modified to fit the Sundarbans\u2019 challenges \nsuch as cyclones. We will embed possibilities for modifications. Participatory \nplanning along with building capacity of local communities will result in the \ndevelopment of evidence-based water security plans with local community \nleaders conducting water budgeting, identifying potential recharge areas, \nand/or expanding traditional water harvesting practices. In addition to these \nactivities, demonstration models complete with freshwater harvesting or \naquifer recharge solutions will be completed in select villages of \nPatharpratima and Gosaba blocks. Informed by data and depending on \ncommunity consensus, solutions could include land shaping for furrow and \nhigh ridge cultivation, \u201cFive Square\u2019 water harvesting structures that \nPRASARI has implemented in Gosaba, aquifer storage and recovery systems, \nand/or rooftop rainwater harvesting systems with tanks. \nIn general, PGWM may seem like a niche topic. But at its core, PGWM builds \ncapacities of communities to map and manage their own resources, \ngenerates local employment (e.g., barefoot hydrogeologists), and empowers \nlocal communities to make data-driven decisions. Our initial projections \nsuggest that about 200 barefoot hydrogeologists and the corresponding \n1,000 water and sanitation committees will participate. It's important to note \nthat this is a preliminary estimation, and the final figures may vary. \nOak Application Form     10\nOak Foundation's investment in PGWM will show the multi-faceted \nsuccessful outputs of this approach to strengthen IWRM, allowing other \nlarge funders to leverage this water-focused method to achieve their \noutcomes related to job creation, community development, and climate \nchange adaptation. The three organizations (Water For People, PRASARI, \nand Akvo) work with several donors that are interested in climate-water-food \nnexus and/or livelihood development, such as Caterpillar Foundation, \nWelthungerhilfe (WHH), Axis Bank Foundation (ABF), and Ajim Premji \nPhilanthropic Foundation. We also work closely with global knowledge \nplatforms like World Water Quality Alliance and Water Point Data Exchange, \nwhich have a keen interest in the Sundarbans, SDGs and specifically water \nquality. There are also talks with donors that are showing interest in citizen \nengagement, data-based decision making and collective action. We will \nleverage Water For People\u2019s Technical Support Unit and embedded staff in \nWest Bengal\u2019s state government and agreement with the Public Health and \nEngineering Department (in Birbhum and South 24 Parganas District) to \nensure government convergence in this program.  \nWe also propose to establish a multi-stakeholder platform that includes local \nCivil Society Organizations (CSOs), such as Oak Partners, in collaboration \nwith Water For People, PRASARI, and Akvo. The objective of this platform \nwould be to facilitate learning, sharing, implementation, and scaling up of \nthe interventions within and beyond the project locations. We propose to \nconduct an annual sharing workshop with our partners to provide a more \ndetailed update on the results and the processes followed to arrive at those \nresults. In this workshop, we will encourage feedback from the partners and \nuse this as an opportunity for cross learning.", "6. PLACE HOLDER": "6. PLACE HOLDER", "7. OBJECTIVES": "7.

(300 words):\nWater For People India has been working in West Bengal/ the Sundarbans \nfor 20+ years. PRASARI, our partner in this region for 10+ years, works \nclosely with local communities. PRASARI is currently working with Water \nFor People in four blocks in West Bengal, with communities on improving \nwater services, integrating water resources management, rainwater \nOak Application Form     14\nharvesting and building recharge structures. Akvo Foundation and Water For \nPeople have a decade-old partnership across the globe generating evidence \nfor program decision making. As program lead, Water For People India will \nlead project design, establish learning processes, liaise with Oak Foundation \nand relevant government departments, communicate regularly to all \nstakeholders, create policy and public facing communications, and submit \nrequired reports. We will also leverage our relationship with West Bengal\u2019s \nstate government to link these communities to government resources.  \nPRASARI will support on-ground implementation. PRASARI will focus on \nstrengthening social capital, building community capacity while \nincorporating traditional knowledge, facilitating aquifer mapping, water \nbudgeting, and water security planning. It will apply Ostrom\u2019s principles for \nmanagement of commons1, modifying as necessary and developing \nprocesses that can sustain momentum after the project has ended. In early \nstages of community interactions with local administration, PRASARI will act \nas a facilitator. Akvo is our technology and data partner, using appropriate \ntechnology to help us to report and build evidence. Local communities will \nuse Akvo\u2019s tools to collect data and information. Akvo will analyze data, \nsummarize findings, indicate trends, and develop data visualizations that \nWater For People and PRASARI will use for community engagement and to \npromote policy and model scale up. Akvo will work closely with Water For \nPeople to develop documentation useful for replicating and scaling up this \nprogram in similar contexts.  \nAdditionally, Water For People and Prasari will leverage their other donors \nworking in West Bengal that are interested in the climate-water-food nexus \nand/or livelihood development, such as Caterpillar Foundation and Ajim \nPremji Philanthropic Foundation.  \nWe will also establish a multi-stakeholder platform that includes local CSOs, \nsuch as Oak Foundation Partners, in collaboration with Water For People, \nPRASARI, and Akvo. The objective of this platform would be to facilitate \nlearning, sharing, implementation, and scaling up of the interventions within \nand beyond the project locations. \nWe will work with these stakeholders (Oak partners and non-Oak partners) \nfrom the very beginning to identify the operational villages and ensure \nintegration with other issues from the outset. The operational villages will be \nselected based on the vulnerability mapping of the Gram Panchayats (an \nadministrative unit that represents a cluster of villages). To conduct \nvulnerability mapping, a participatory tool will be used to assess 15 \nindicators distributed across four categories: Social, Climatic, Institutional \nand Economic.  \nSocial:  \ni. Ratio of Schedule Caste, Schedule Tribal & Other Backward Caste(s) ration \nto total population, \nii. Literacy Rate, \niii. Rate of migration to total no of families, \niv. Ratio of total number of toilet blocks to total number of households. \nClimate: \ni. Ratio of vulnerable river embankment to total embankment, \nii. Climatic disaster impact ratio (Ratio of number of disaster(s) in a \nOak Application Form     15\nparticular year with average number of climate disaster in last 10 years, \niii. Ratio of total submergent area to total area. \nInstitutional: \ni. Rate of migration to total number of families, \nii. Child mortality rate, \niii. Participation of women to the labor force, \niv. Average number of families dependent on drinking water from tube \nwells, \nv. Ratio of average distance from school, Panchayat and hospital to national \naverage. \nEconomic:  \ni.

Average income from farm-based livelihoods and manufacturing + service \nsector.\nThese indications have been carefully outlined, agreed upon in public \nforums, and weighed uniformly. In addition, it is evaluated using a 5-point \nLikert scale, with the combined scores for each metric serving as the final \nevaluation. Gram Panchayats (GP) with a score of less than 2.5 are at risk of \nvulnerability. If a vulnerable GP is identified, all its corresponding revenue \nvillages will be included for implementation. As GPs are clusters of villages \nwithout further assessment, we incorporate all the revenue villages of a \nvulnerable GP for action.??", "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING \nThis section is twofold. Please tell us:\na) Monitoring and evaluation. How will you know if you are achieving your objectives? Please \ndescribe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is working. \nIf you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or \nconduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.\nb) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or \ntest through this grant.\n(300 words):\nThe project team (Water For People, PRASARI and Akvo) will employ \neffective MEL mechanisms (includes practices and tools) that provides a \nstructured approach to track project progress, assess impact, and foster \ncontinuous learning in a comprehensive and meaningful way.  The following \npoints describe our approach: \n- We will jointly design theory and pathways of change to create a logical \nframework to understand how our intended project activities will lead to the \ndesired outcomes and impact. This step is critical as it underpins every \naspect of the proposed project's implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. \nDuring the design step, we will develop results framework, a high-level \nOak Application Form     16\nstructure, that outlines the project's objectives, outcomes, indicators, \nactivities, inputs, and assumptions in a concise manner. \n- We will flesh-out an Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) framework from the \nproject results framework focused on how monitoring and evaluation will be \nconducted to track progress. We will develop a well-structured monitoring \nplan to transform the M&E framework into actionable steps by outlining the \nmethodologies, responsibilities, timelines, and resources required for \neffective project monitoring. At project inception, the team will outline data \nneeds and data use (for reporting, community, dissemination, advocacy, and \ndecision making) based on the M&E framework. To measure progress and \nimpact accurately, the project team will jointly design and implement \nbaseline and endline assessments. For concurrent monitoring, the team will \ndesign data collection instruments (qualitative and quantitative) aligned with \nthe indicators and ensure these are user-friendly and capture the required \ninformation accurately. Additionally, we will leverage on Water For People's \ncurrent resources, including internal tracking spreadsheets, biannual \nreports, and the Sustainable Services Checklist for water and sanitation. Our \napproach involves enhancing such existing data and processes to optimize \ntheir effectiveness for the proposed project.  \n- We will employ real-time (near real-time) progress tracking of key \nperformance indicators and milestones to gain insights into how the project \nis advancing toward its set targets across the time and space of the project \ncontext. We will use technology and data to provide up-to-date information \nabout the project's status, enabling swift decision-making and adjust \nstrategies/activities based on real-time data and learning. Akvo will enable a \ncentralized web-based platform to monitor project data and prepare a \npredictive analysis model/simulation for forecasting conditions that impact \nwater sources and make informed decisions about the sustainability of their \nwater sources.  \n- We will integrate Data-Driven Insights into project operations to conduct \nrealistic assessment of project achievements and challenges and incorporate \na learning component in the project plan. These insights will reveal trends, \npatterns, and areas of improvement in the project.  We will also use these \ninsights to develop adaptive strategies and refine our approach during \nproject implementation. These may include insights that help us assess what \nelements of our interventions are working and if there is a need to \nimprove/change project activities and/or intervention logic.

We will also build on Water For People\u2019s existing tools, such \nas the Sustainable Services Checklist for water and sanitation which includes \nOak Application Form     17\n11 indicators with specific criteria to meet, particularly for Water Resources \nManagement.  \nWe anticipate that by adopting a participatory approach, villages will teach \nall partners about the challenges they face and solutions they may have \nalready attempted. We will apply these learnings to demonstrate models for \ninterventions. Learnings in the form of reports and policy briefs will be \nshared with Block, District and State administration officials to identify the \nimplementation issues and to gain buy-in on successful models. Learnings in \nthe form of blogs, success stories will be shared on different social media \nplatforms. Water For People will also share data with World Water Quality \nAlliance and Water Point Data Exchange and results with wider audiences as \nrelevant such as during World Water Week and the All Systems Connect \nsymposium. \nWe will create a culture of using data for decision making and ensure \ncommunity engagement and active participation in water security planning \nby implementing the following strategies:? \n\u2022At the project\u2019s outset, we will engage community members to \ncollaboratively design the water security plans within the project's \nregions. This approach ensures ownership, cultivates awareness, and \nfamiliarizes them with the nuances of the planning process. Our intent \nis to create a culture of using data to make decisions and align \nincentives (improving water security, lives and livelihoods) to sustain \nthe habit beyond the tenure of a project.? \n\u2022We will ensure the project data about the water security planning \nprocess is transformed into simple, clear and actionable information \nthat local communities and their governments (GP, block and district) \ncan understand and utilize to make key water management decisions. \nWater user communities will be involved in the design of data \ncollection and analysis process (what data to collect, who would do the \nanalysis, in what form the analyzed data will be available to make \ndecisions). Based on the user feedback, we will create a set of \nquantitative and qualitative tools. Local communities will be trained to \nfield test the tools, give feedback, and help improve the tools. We will \nalso engage members of local communities (Self Help Groups and other \ncommunity-based organizations) to collect the actual data, be involved \nduring the analysis and present the data back to their fellow \ncommunity members.? \n\u2022We will ensure communities are actively involved in the periodic (most \nlikely annual) updates of water security plans to ensure that the plans \nremain relevant, effective, and aligned with the evolving needs and \npriorities of the community.??", "10.

The place has always \nearned a special interest in the world map because of its uniqueness of the Mangrove \nforests and the lifestyle of the local inhabitants. People have been mostly dependent \non agriculture and fishing. Owing to recent climatic changes, there is evidence of \nlivelihood dearth adding to increasing vulnerability amongst all sections of the \ninhabitants. Interventions and support from the various local level organizations, \ngovernment schemes have remained detrimental to the development of this area. \nDay-by-day, people are becoming increasingly dependent on immediate support \nrather than making themselves more reliant and capacitated by participating in \nsustainable processes of growth and development.\nAmong the 15 Blocks in the South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, Pathar \nPratima is one of the largest blocks and known as one of the critical blocks in terms \nof adverse social issues. The various publications and researches have pointed \ntowards the increasing adversities related to human trafficking, increasing \nmigration, insufficient alternatives to livelihood, frequent disasters in this block \nleading to severe adverse consequences on all section of inhabitants.\nHerambagopalpur Gram Panchayat is located in the northern side of the \nPatharpratima Block. The size of the area is about 868.3 hectares. It comprises 4 \nmain villages, namely, Heramba Gopalpur, Dakshin Kashinagar, Kuemuri and Purba \nSurendranagar. Kuemuri in the Dakshin Kashinagar in the South-East surrounds \nHeramba Gopalpur along the Matla river. A total of 17 Sansads are included in these \n4 villages.\nDue to its deltaic location, the river network forms the major transport system of \nthis area and people are dependent on the river both for transportation and \nlivelihood. Being located in the deltaic region, the rivers here are tidal in nature. The \narea remains flooded mostly during the rainy season and the situation worsens at \ntimes of natural calamities. Breaching of river embankments, river bank erosion are \nthus very common phenomena here. All these natural calamities have an adverse \neffect on the people residing there. Remoteness and undeveloped infrastructural \nfacilities add to irreparable damages of life and property.   MUKTI has been working \nfor the underprivileged people in the Sundarban area since 2003. Interventions at \nPatharpratima Block by Mukti started almost 5-6 years back. More than 70 students \nin the Herambagopalpur GP are being benefited through the Mukti Support School \nCentres. The women empowerment programme focussing on developing \nentrepreneurship skills through the MCDF project includes almost 1200 women \nfrom the GP. Mukti aims to continue ongoing such initiatives to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment for these people.", "4. GEOGRAPHY": "5.List the major countries where your activities take place.

The organisation was started by a group of \nlocal youths who had gradually decided to develop the vision and lay the \nfoundation for a sustainable development.Today, the organisation is spread across \n54 Gram Panchayats in the whole of North and South 24 Parganas. The \norganisation has been working intensively with almost 50,000 households, 30,000 \nSHG women, 3500 children who are mostly in penury, social exclusion and myriad \ndiscrimination and are extremely vulnerable to climate hazards like strong storms, \ncyclic cyclone and frequent dreadful disasters adding to resource dearth, penury, \nvulnerability and violence. In addition to this, Mukti has provided scholarships to \nmore than 2000 students for higher studies, planted 2.5 lac mangrove, created and \nprovided livelihood opportunities to the local people. Mukti is governed by the \nBoard of Trustees comprising of the Founder-President, Secretary, Assistant \nSecretary, Treasurer and other members. Each trustee in their roles, function with \nspecific assigned responsibilities. Mukti has almost 35 Consultants directly \nworking in different areas and capacities and more than 200 volunteers who are \ninvolved with the day-to-day functioning of the organisation. Each project team \nreports to the Programme Officer, President and Secretary for project \nimplementation and planning.

Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\nIn order to maintain a stable financial situation in the organisation, Mukti has \ndeveloped its own financial policy to be adhered to by each and every concerned \nperson. Mukti also shared the financial planning with every Project Coordinator to \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\nmaintain the costs and avoid any discrepancies or over expenses or even any \nunnecessary expenses. To prevent any hindrance in regular project activities, \nmajority of the donors of Mukti offer to transfer the whole amount after which \nutilisation is shared. This helps in meeting the gap in the other projects which \ntransfers the funds almost like giving reimbursements to the organization after \ncompletion of the activities.\nThe operation cost of each project is maintained with the line time and involves a \nmajor part of the budget. All operational costs requests are raised from time to time \nfor seeking approval of the Secretary and thereafter expenses are made. Submission \nof the utilization is made as per the donor requirement at specified intervals and in \nspecified formats.\nFundraising has been an important aspect of Mukti. Since the previous year, Mukti \nhas hired a qualified Consultant for CSR and Fundraising. All necessary information \nand updates on the projects are in knowledge of the fundraising expert which are \nshared with potential donors and grant givers. Face to face meetings, presentations \nand practical knowledge sharing, exploring scopes of fundraising through \ncrowdfunding platforms are commonly practiced in Mukti.\nMukti believes in utilizing the majority of the amount for the activities rather than \nmaintaining a huge amount for contingency. Any odd situations / financial crisis in \nthe organisation have been faced with help of the team members. Mukti does not \nrequest for any such miscellaneous funds and tries to keep the requests very \ndefined.\n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nThough a young institution of more than 17 years, MUKTI, a non-profit socio-\neconomic organization, working for Sundarban people in the Delta region of South \n24 Parganas, West Bengal, India, has accumulated a lot of accolades.\nIt was in the year 2003 when a few enthusiastic young minds of Sunderban \nbecame determined to redress some of the most intrinsic problems involving \neducation and health. They decided to involve the educated and energetic local \nyouth in the various community development projects. These youths gradually \nstarted developing the vision and finally laid the foundation of MUKTI. The local \npeople supported them in this quench and the services continued and grew every \nyear paving its way for a sustainable development for these marginalised \npeople.  The commendable job by the team has been broadcasted by \u2018BBC \nWorldwide service\u2019 and the \u2018Dadagiri\u2019 show. The organization has received various \naccolades like Vivek Samman award, Star of Asia award, Bharat Excellence award, \nKrishi Ratna, APJ Abdul Kalam award, True legend award by Telegraph, AmiCare \naward on livelihood. The work of the organisation is visible in various national and \ninternational platforms and in state newspapers.  Today, MUKTI has been able to \nspread its wings in almost every state and country. Hundreds of volunteers have \nbecome associated with us and are supporting our noble cause. Our volunteers are \ninvolved with providing expertise knowledge to fund raising and also to work with \nthe people directly in the field. Educational institutions have reached out to Mukti \nfor placements and internships for building a strong foundation among their \nstudents entitled with social commitment and values.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nMukti is already developing strategy to explore new geographical areas and \nexploring feasibility of new initiatives as per community requirement. The \norganization will be expanding to other districts in West Bengal in the next few \nmonths. With this, our organization is also focusing on reaching out to the maximum \npopulation who are very deserving and need support. Mukti believes in maximizing \nquality initiatives which will directly impact the beneficiaries. And to learn from \nthem how projects may be implemented as all the communities are dynamic in \nnature and have their own individualities. It is important for us to develop strategy \naccordingly. The current strategy also involves capacitating the team for better \nunderstanding of the realities and efficient outcome. In order to get timely outputs, \nresponsibilities are well decentralized amongst the team members and regular \nmeetings and field visits are a continuous process of the strategy. This is not only at \nthe ground level but also at the Board level where each Trustee has definite function \nto do in their own roles. Mukti invites volunteers and interns and respects their \ninterest in social work. They are involved and assigned with specific tasks as per \ntheir expertise, interest and convenience which helps in the development of strong \nvalues among the youngsters. Regular information sharing through newsletters, \npress releases are an important part of the work to reach out to more and more \npeople. Already many associations, national and international have joined hands \nwith Mukti for the commendable initiatives. It has been our strategy to upkeep these \nand share all updates about the organisation from time to time.\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nMukti is working towards an enabling environment for the community people so that \nthese people are capacitated in such a way that they are able to identify their \nvulnerabilities and address them to reduce their vulnerability. In the process of \ndoing that, Mukti has helped the community people to identify their own problems \nand people have been able to come up with solutions related to livelihood, dearth in \nresources, disaster preparedness, gender equality, education, health, adolescent \nproblems and at the same time have also been able to identify ways to mitigate them \nfrom their own levels. These problems are related to agriculture, fishing and honey \ncollection and how improvement can be brought into them. Community people have \ndiscussed about gender discrimination, evidence of drop out among school children, \nabsence of basic health facilities in the communities, especially for women, impact \nof frequent disasters and how important is disaster preparedness essential in the \ncommunity along with problems of deforestation and was to address them. As \nobserved by Mukti, it is crucial to develop the insight among the community people \nto identify these as problems and strengthen their capacities to help them address \nthem.\nFor  fulfilling the objectives of the project, Mukti has also identified lots of \nopportunities. Firstly, there is ample scope to involve youths and volunteers from \nthe communities having understanding of the dynamics of the  community and \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\nmaking them learn and develop skills to lead the community development \ninitiatives.  Secondly, this project creates opportunities for networking \npartnerships among other grass root organizations and resource organizations \nwhich has a great scope for learning and understanding issues better.  Thirdly, the \nproject has a good scope of adapting to the community needs rather than creating \nany unnecessary imposition on the community people. This is a great opportunity \nto understand the socio-economic-cultural contexts of the community and \naccordingly plan with them the future steps.\nWhile working in the community, Mukti has observed certain challenges as well. \nFirstly, it has been noticed that the community people are very much influenced by \nthe local politicians in each and every step. All schemes, provisions are very much \ninfluenced by the politicians and the community is divided into \u2013 privileged and the \nunderprivileged. Secondly, frequent disasters have hampered the functioning of \nthe community severely. Everytime, such disasters have been havoc and people \nhave lost everything. It is very difficult for the community people to re-start, even \nthough that becomes difficult because of the severe financial crunch. Thirdly, the \ncurrent pandemic situation has not improved overall in the rural areas. People \nrestrain outsiders from coming inside, many have lost jobs, demoralized and \nuncertain when the situation will improve and if there will be any scope to get \nback to work. The pandemic has jeopardized the families leading to precipitating \nother adverse social issues. Fourthly, the capacity of the community people in \nterms of motivation and willingness has severely been hit by the various calamities \nand other factors in the community.

Even though \nyou may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the \nproposed grant. (300 words)\nKamonohashi Project was founded in 2002 in Japan, aiming at combatting \nhuman trafficking of children for commercial sexual exploitation in the world. \nIt started the projects in Cambodia where the child trafficking for commercial \nsexual exploitation was rampant, and it focused (1) to build community-based \nfactory for the most vulnerable populations in rural Cambodia not to take the \nrisk of unsafe migration, and (2) to support police training to strengthen the \nprosecution against traffickers. With the gradual shift of the issue, Kamo \nembarked on the global field study and concluded to support India in 2012. \nKamo\u2019s support in India aims to strengthen access to justice by the survivors \nof human trafficking through systems strengthening approach. Kamo \nfacilitates breaking polarization in development debates through dialogue and \ndeep listening. Kamo also strongly believes in leadership development in \nsurvivors and among organizational founders and second line leaders to \nstrengthen the ecosystem of the civil society. In 2022, after three-year internal \ndialogue, Kamo decided to shift from mission-driven to the principle-based \norganization, and the new principle, \u201cDignity for All\u201d, was approved by its \nGeneral Assembly. Key achievements are;\n1. Kamo handed over the Cambodia Programme to build further social \nleadership programme using the community-based factory. This process \nwas handled professionally with financial transaction, and this type of \nbusiness succession was of a rare case in the Japanese social sector;\n2. Kamo built, nurtured and supported Tafteesh Programme since 2013, \nand Tafteesh received the Stop Slavery Collaboration Award from the \nThomson Reuters Foundation in 2022;\nKamo is supported by 14,999 subscribed supporters as of May 2023. The \nfundraising model of Kamo is recognized as successful and unique in \nJapanese civil societies. The donations from those individual supporters have \nbeen enabling Kamo to design and support strategic programmes based on \nthe contextual needs in India.\n5c.

Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nSecondary Research on Global Prevention of Human Trafficking (Balu et al, \n2021) under the last phase of Tafteesh revealed that (1) prevention of human \ntrafficking is defined in a highly varied manner, depending upon the approach \nto human trafficking, (2) vulnerability to trafficking may show a stronger \ncorrelation with relative poverty rather than absolute poverty, (3) \ncommunities and systems sustain vulnerability through permissive \nOak Application Form     7\nenvironment that prevent quick identification of victims, and (4) the research \ncalls for ecological, holistic and multidisciplinary approaches, reiterating that \nsingle-focused interventions will not impact the overall vulnerability of \npopulations that are at risk of trafficking (Attachment 3).\n\u201cPreventing Trafficking: Sustainable developmental solutions to combat \ntrafficking (Change Mantras, 2021)\u201d under the last phase of Tafteesh also \nclarified that (1) there is no cogent policy on prevention of trafficking either \nin India or other parts of the world, (2) most anti trafficking programmes focus \non responses to trafficking, rather than pre-emptively seeking to mitigate or \nprevent exploitations or violations that lead to trafficking, and (3) \ninterventions are largely community based and making parents more \nresponsible to prevent their children from being trafficked, and they lack the \nclarity of responsibility of duty-bearers such as district administration, \npanchayat and police in prevention (Attachment 4).\nWest Bengal is reportedly one of the most affected states by human trafficking \nand has been a high prevalence state according to the National Crime Records \n(Attachment C). Existing anti trafficking policies, laws or programmes, by the \ngovernment or NGOs do not seem to have created any dent on the prevalence. \nAnti trafficking interventions have long focused on responsive initiatives - \nrehabilitation of survivors, reparation and penalisation of offenders. Even \nthough all instruments on human trafficking to address prevention, there are, \nin fact, very few policies, laws or programmes that are focused on prevention, \nnot only in West Bengal, but across India.\nTafteesh is one of the largest and most significant civil society led anti \ntrafficking initiative in India today, that has mobilised and organised survivors \nof sex trafficking in North and South 24 Parganas in West Bengal and have \nsucceeded in establishing survivor led initiatives in claiming rehabilitation and \nprotection services from local governments, administration and health service \nproviders, claiming compensation and assert rights to accountability from law \nenforcement agencies, legal services authorities and the judicial system in \nprosecution of traffickers. This led to the question - now that community based \norganisations and survivor collectives in these two districts that have become \nempowered to design and take action, how would it address the gap in absence \nof any preventative measures on human trafficking?\nThe Preventing Trafficking research indicated distinguishable patterns and \ndifferences in opinion on effective prevention between youth and adults, state \nduty bearers and common people. The research also identified information \ngaps in areas of labour trafficking, trafficking in men and boys, trafficking in \ntransgender persons as well as underlying factors that explain higher \nvulnerability amongst people from scheduled caste and Muslims[1].\nThe opportunities emerged through the last two phases to build on this \nprevention piece is the survivor collectives, people who are victims of labour \ntrafficking seeking support services, the enhanced capacities of the NGOs, the \nwide network of Tafteesh which include established connections with the \nlegal, law enforcement and other relevant departments. This request from Oak \nFoundation is to enable Tafteesh to build on and implement diverse and unique \nprevention approaches relevant to local contexts based on rights-based and \ncommunity-based initiatives in West Bengal.\nOak Application Form     8\n[1] That Muslims and SC have a disproportionate vulnerability was claimed \nby social workers, activists and survivors who participated in the research, \nbased on their own experiences, data and observations.", "6.

CBOs are also skilled to \nprovide legal services to survivors both for victim compensation and \nprosecution of traffickers, making legal services available from DLSA \nand private lawyers, escalating dereliction of duties or faulty \ninvestigations in cases to High Court using protest petitions or appeal.\nOak Application Form     15\n \n5. Please state the factors behind prevalence of trafficking.\nIndia\u2019s policy on rehabilitation is ineffective, with poor rates of trauma-\nrecovery, economic security or social assimilation or protection from stigma. \nThis systemic neglect alienates survivors from the State. Because India does \nnot have a rehabilitation policy nationally or in any state, the role and \naccountability of duty bearers - Panchayats, administration, health \ndepartments remains fuzzy. This leaves survivors vulnerable to further \nviolence in families and communities, and results in domestic violence and re-\ntrafficking. Investigations of cases of human trafficking are handled by the \ngeneral police stations with limited resources and structural support for \ninterstate investigations. The chain of crime is not investigated or established \nleading to poor case for prosecution. The non functioning of Anti Human \nTrafficking Units leads to poor conviction rates to deter trafficking crimes \nacross states over years. Poor rate of access of compensations by survivors is \na result of lack of the implementation of victim compensation scheme by Legal \nServices Authorities across states. Due to the lack of prevention policy \nthroughout the country, the roles and responsibilities of government duty-\nbearers to prevent human trafficking remains unclear to all. Lack of \ninvestment in survivors leadership in the sector lead to lack of inclusion of \nsurvivors as active agents in designing, implementing and monitoring \ninterventions contributes to the fragmentation and also results in lack of \nownership, sustainability and alignment of anti trafficking approaches with \nneeds of communities vulnerable to trafficking.\n \n6.

Context (The context section should not exceed two pages.)\n6a. Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, \ngovernance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nNCAS is a membership based organisation, it began with an idea to make \nadvocacy people centered, hence several stalwarts contributed to this collective \nidea of people centered advocacy. NCAS membership is both organizational and \nindividuals, the board approves the memberships of the organisation and \nindividuals. As per the rules of the organisation, the executive director or the \nNational Co-ordinator are appointed by the board and report to the board. The \nexecutive director in consultation with the key functionaries of the board makes \nother appointments, like the senior program officer, program officer, researcher \netc. The Executive Committee is headed by the president and assisted by the \nsecretary and the treasurer, the other members of the board help in decision \nmaking process, largely related to the membership of the general body, funding, \nprogram strategy etc. As a research organisation the composition of the staff is \nexpected to be that of researchers, research director, senior program manger, \nprogram officers- Admin and accounts persons. Independent consultants are hired \nfor specific tasks when required.  Depending on the availability of funds in the \nfuture the staff capacity will be increased. Currently including the executive \ndirector there is a senior program officer, an admin person and a part time finance \nperson.  Consultants are hired as required\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20135\n6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\nCurrently the organisation has got just one small grant from Centre for budget \ngovernance and accountability- about 5,40,000/-. Some of the Indian funding \ngroups have gotten in direct contract with our staff, which covers only program \ncost. Oak grant is the other foreign grant that we are dependent on. The annual \noperating cost for Admin, maintenance cost and Salary is about 30lakhs (With a \nsmall staff) the program cost and programmatic costs are about 20 lakhs. Funding \nis sought through RFPs, other announcements, partnership with organisation for \ntraining and capacity building, efforts towards achieving accreditations are being \nmade. NCAS has also now moved towards an academics and has initiated short \ncertificate courses for development sector professionals, students and individuals \ninterested in public policy and advocacy, this is program for NCAS to increase its \nvisibility and also sustain itself.  NCAS also has a corpus however the efforts of \nfund raising are made to ensure that the corpus is not depleted.\n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nNCAS is a premiere policy research institution in India. NCAS was formed in 1992 \nby leading academics, jurists and social activists. since its inception, the Board of \nDirectors is led by people of eminence with Justice P. N. Bhagwati, (former Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court of India) as the founding President, followed by noted \nplaywright Vijay Tendulkar and Dr. Aruna Roy, among others. Over the years, NCAS \nhas gained recognition as a premiere institution in policy research and governance \nin India and global south. NCAS has over 29 years of experience in capacity \ndevelopment, knowledge creation, networking in public policy and governance in \nIndia and internationally. It has trained leaders in academia, journalism, policy think \ntanks in India and 30 countries in the world. NCAS believes proper policy and its \ngovernance can create huge differences in the lives of millions of people. NCAS \npioneered the idea of people centered advocacy, enabling marginalized communities \nto participate in the process of policy advocacy.\nSince last 29 years, NCAS is actively engaged in capacity development, research \nand knowledge creation, campaign support, social movement and knowledge \nnetworking and media with a particular focus on the policy and governance from \nthe lens of the marginalized.\nThe \u2018Advocacy Internship Program\u2019, for building capacities of youth, was launched \nin 1999. A meticulously formulated curriculum to understand the complexities of \nthe Indian condition \u2013 its social fabric, economics and politics \u2013 both academically \nand in the context of socio-cultural realities, guided this program for preparing \nyouth in the praxis of people-centered advocacy it produced around 100 young \nleaders who are working in various positions in organizations from academics, \nmedia, policy think tanks and civil society organisations from grassroots to \ninternational level. NCAS has conducted evidence-based research on various \nissues especially tribal land rights and has published knowledge materials that \nwere very useful for students, researchers and activists.  NCAS has initiated \ncertificate courses on public policy and advocacy reaching out to more and more \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\nprofessionals who are interested in Public Policy.\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nThe scenario of the contemporary socio-political environment mandates that more \nthan management and consultancy skills, a studied approach towards social \nchange shall prove to be more beneficial. In this light the National Center for \nAdvocacy Studies (NCAS) will prove to be the perfect agent to advance both the \nrequisites of the contemporary scenario:\n1.      Nurturing professional experts with an academic background for evidence-\nbased advocacy\n2.      Creating research materials and advocacy resources enabling generation of \neffective policy and productive interventions.\nSocial Enterprise model of development\n\u2022Mainstreaming Public Policy Education\n\u2022Enhancing the skills of professional to develop creative innovations in the social \nsector domain\n\u2022Creating a market for social sector change makers.\nStrategic Direction\n1.

For the next five years NCAS plans to \nwork on access to public services, health, food security, education, disaster \nmanagement and climate change\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nWith gaping problems consisting of threats to natural and human capital it was \nclear that any action by the formulation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \nhas to be formulated to ensure protection and thriving of humanity and the \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nenvironment. \nSeeking accountability from the system has now become the most challenging task \nfor the civil society actors. The changing political scenario has tried hard to silence \nthe voices from the margins, the current economic crisis in the country affects the \nmarginalized communities the most, discrimination, and denial of social justice \nhave become more pressing, giving a push to the civil society in the direction of \npeople-centered and people-monitored advocacy for accountability of egalitarian \nState actions.\nOne of the thematic, education is the one we have been focusing on in \nMaharashtra, the New Education Policy of 2020 which has now moved into the \nimplementation phase, has been under heavy criticism while the policy seems to \nprovide a wide range of opportunity for students, there is still a huge gap between \nthe ground realities and the implementation plan. While one of the major \nchallenges that has engulfed us is the pandemic, which has pushed some of the \nmost vulnerable sections to the margins even further. Children have dropped out \nof school; loss of learning is one of the major concerns in this era where digital \nlearning has taken over. A number of children have fallen in the cracks due to lack \nof opportunity. With the state wide networks and other civil society groups, there \nhas been a constant effort to highlight the plight of these children by constantly \nengaging with the government agency to not overlook the ground realities, one of \nthe major struggles is towards reopening of schools, the government is yet to take \na clear stand on the same.   Demanding accountability from the government \nespecially while accessing the right to food is yet another major problem especially \nin the remote tribal areas where access to services is still very low. The systems \nand structures that need to be in place to ensure that access to food is not \nhampered are also in a limbo, the vigilance committees formulated under Public \nDistribution System still continue to be either dysfunctional or have not been \nformulated. These committees play a key role from within the village to ensure \nquality control and equal distribution. However, the lack of these committees or \nthe dysfunctional nature is due to the lack of will within the system to ensure \ntransparency and accountability. NCAS has been engaged in creating awareness, \nenabling communities to seek accountability from the government in two districts, \nhere the communities being close knit usually do not raise questions against their \nown members who are in position of power, that\u2019s a major hurdle. It is evident that \nmalnutrition became a very serious concern hence seeking accountability for food \nsecurity is a very key concern.\nIn terms of opportunities- National and local networks are of a great support to \namplify the issues\nAt state lever there are still avenues for negotiation and dialogue with the \ngovernment.\nSome of the major challenges is the ongoing pandemic that takes over all other \nissues and has slowed down negotiations. The current dispensation also leaves \nvery little room for rights of people. In such a climate the only hope is to uphold \nthe democratic rights given in the constitution of India.", "7.

(300 words)\nInspired by the belief that, at their best, lawyers are rights protectors and \ndefenders who can unlock opportunities iProbono was established in 2009. We \nembedded our model locally in India and other South Asian jurisdictions \nstriving to deliver our mission to ensure access to justice for all in pursuit of a \njust society.\nCore achievements:\n\u20222023: iProbono India was awarded the Children Champions Award by \nthe Delhi Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) in \nrecognition of our work to ensure justice for all. More details here: \nhttps://i-probono.com/case-study/iprobono-wins-childrens-champions-\naward-2023/\n\u20222018 to date: Our successful pilot \u2018Accelerate\u2019 Program provides sub-\ngrants t projects in India and Bangladesh. For example, in Assam, we \nprovide funding and legal expertise to a group of lawyers to protect \nOak Application Form     6\ncitizenship rights of the most vulnerable people. Deliverables include: \nDirect litigation support before Foreigners Tribunals (FT) and Gauhati \nHigh Court; legal training and capacity building for lawyers and \ncommunity members; awareness campaigns including social media, \npublic events and door to door outreach. iProbono maintains an \u2018under \nthe radar\u2019 approach and a \u2018no visibility\u2019 policy. This year we ensured the \nrelease of 5 people from detention centres, provided 33 clients with \ninterim protection from arrest, contested 3 FT cases and filed 41 writ \npetitions to protect the citizenship rights of our clients.\n\u20222019: iProbono hosted over 50 human rights defenders, lawyers, \nactivists and storytellers working in South Asia at a closed Forum in \nColombo Sri Lanka to \u2018Accelerate Inclusive Movements for Social \nJustice\u2019 in the region. The aim was to discuss strategies for litigation and \nlegal advocacy as well as change hearts and minds of the public on key \nthematic areas including citizenship rights and LGBT+ rights: \ndecriminalisation of homosexuality and legislating for transgender \ncommunities. We maintained this group and achieved impact in these \nareas.\n5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? \nHow will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and \ndecide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nProblem statement: Our work in South Asia over the past 10 years has shown \nus that despite sustained efforts by both government and civil society, access \nto justice in the current economic, social and political scenario in India \nremains extremely unequal. A two-tiered justice system allows only a \nprivileged minority to understand the law and access justice. While state-led \nlegal aid provisions and other legal recourse mechanisms do exist, not every \nmarginalised community/individual (women, children, survivors of abuse, \nreligious minorities, migrant workers and the disabled to name a few) has easy \naccess to these mechanisms. Poor legal literacy and/or the lack of awareness \nof one\u2019s rights under the law further hinders any meaningful engagement with \nthe justice system. As a result, legal representation remains beyond the reach \nof poor and vulnerable communities. We also note that grassroots \norganisations representing the interests of these vulnerable communities \nsimilarly suffer from a lack of quality and affordable legal advice. And finally, \nprimary stakeholders within the justice system (for example, public \nprosecutors, the police, lawyers, and so on) often lack nuanced knowledge of \nthe laws that serve to protect the rights of these communities.\nTheory of Change: iProbono\u2019s pathway to real change is based in a law and \ndevelopment paradigm that ensures the most vulnerable communities in our \nsociety have access to and a voice within the legal system. Our model of \nholistic counsel engages and combines a series of tools including litigation, \ndirect legal advice, professional development, outreach and community \neducation, research advocacy and policy, and capacity building. Storytelling \nOak Application Form     7\nto change hearts and minds cross cuts across our tools and the concept of \n\u2018comprehensive care\u2019 provides us with an additional tool to go one step \nbeyond the legal. Alongside our capacity building and litigation support, we \nhave also provided our partner organisations across India with emergency \nhunger relief funding during the Covid pandemic, or psychosocial support \nour clients who are survivors of sexual abuse in India or the ability to \nevacuate and support of 120 at risk women from Afghanistan when the \nTaliban seized power in 2021.\nThis holistic justice model thus aims to both prevent rights violations, seek \nsolutions when violations have occurred, and catalyse deeper systemic \nchange. With the Oak Foundation\u2019s support, we intend to deepen our \nengagement in each of these areas with selected sub-grantees in West \nBengal: 2 carefully selected partner organisations to deliver holistic access \nto justice to vulnerable communities in West Bengal.\nWe have held an initial consultation with a core group of 8 organisations \ncurrently supported by the Oak Foundation to gain insight in to the type of \naccess justice issues faced by communities. As part of the proposal, we have \nincluded an initial scoping period to allow our internal team to apply the \nstated theory of change in the selection of sub-grantee organisations as well \nas in the process of supporting these organisations to plan delivery.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion underpin our theory of change and an active \ninternal Equality Law team advises on how we inform each of our programs \nfrom choice of delivery partner to thematic issues covered in our work. \niProbono intends to monitor implementation in this area during the grant \nperiod.", "6.

These spaces were promoted as places for exploration, agency and \nbehavioural change.\nThe strategy that was adopted was called the 3C Model which referred to \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\nCollectives (collectivising adolescents), Community (advocating with and \nmobilising the community in favour of the rights of children and adolescents) and \nCampus (developing leadership programmes for young people so they can set up \ntheir own projects)\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nThe problems we are addressing are chiefly around   understanding community led \nactions, is the meaning of effective participation and revisiting boundaries \nbetween the community and the organization. Simultaneously we are also looking \nat how the concept of child agency can be integrated into child rights/protection \nwork and how by addressing masculinities related issues we can include boys and \nmen as allies in our efforts to assume gender equity.\nPraajak believes that any capacity development should be built on the foundation \nof the existing strengths of trainees and make use of their experiences. This will \nmean any capacity building will use both experiential training and handholding \nduring implementation as major methodologies.\nCommunication and appropriate messaging have emerged as a major challenge for \npartner organization and there is a legacy of organisational interaction with \nstakeholders which needs to be tackled in a way that harm can be reduced for the \norganisation\u2019s current operations.\nA comprehensive advocacy workshop emphasising needs to be conducted for all \nstaff in one or more phases as is suitable to the organisation.\nThe following areas will need to be addressed:\n\u2022The difference between advocacy on one hand and community mobilisation, \npublic relations and IEC/BCC on the other.\n\u2022Formulation of SMART advocacy adjectives\n\u2022Stakeholder Analysis and Messaging\n\u2022A framework for organisational strategy regarding stakeholder \ncommunication.\n\u2022Additionally, a tool called the CCC-NERO will be introduced that will help to \nenhance the skills of social workers of partner organizations on the \nfrontline.\nChild Marriage, Child Trafficking and Child Labour in terms of Root Causes, \nIdentifying Vulnerabilities, Legislation Custody vs Agency, Response \nSystems\nGender and Social Development- Concept of Gender, Gender Norms and Roles, \nPatriarchy, Gender based Discrimination and Violence, Gender Equity\nDocumentation-Understanding Narratives and Storytelling, Understanding \nAudience, Documentation Skills The overall recommendation is the following:\n1. Praajak will create a module (in Bangla, if that is convenient) for the above \nareas\n2. Praajak will use the module to organise a Training of Trainers (TOT) of \nsenior officials. The trainers can then use the module and the experience of \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nthe training to further train their staff who work on the frontline.\n3.

Since 2005, we have trained \n1,76,000+ youth in industry specific trades and placed 75-80% youth in jobs \nin automotive, hospitality, healthcare, electrical, beauty & construction trades \namong our 2000+ industry partners at our 130+ centers spread across 16 \nstates. We also run entrepreneurship development projects and have \nsupported 5,300+ entrepreneurs.\nThe following are some of Pratham\u2019s key achievements:\n1.Blended learning approach: Effective blended learning project in \n1000 communities since 2016. 8000 tablets and 1000 Raspberry Pis \ndistributed, impacting 60,000 children and 6000 youth, including 2000 \ndrop-outs.\n2.Hybrid Skilling Innovation: Pratham pivoted to a remote-contact self-\nlearning and virtual-training model in 20,000+ villages during the \nlockdown leading to employment for 32,000+ youth from Oct 2020-\nMarch 2022.\n3.Post-Placement Tracking: To ensure continued retention in \nemployment, Pratham reaches out to each trainee every 3 months, for a \nperiod of 1 year, collecting 110+ data points tracking their employment \nstatus and need for further placement assistance. Pratham is the only \norganization in the ecosystem to conduct such a tracking.\n5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? \nHow will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and \ndecide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \nOak Application Form     8\ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nThe communities of North Bengal live in precarious conditions, highly \ndependent on employment provided by tea-plantation owners. Low wages, \nseasonal employment cycle, plantation owners\u2019 restrictions and lack of \nalternative income-earning opportunities are some of the key challenges \nfaced by these communities. To understand the region in more detail, a \nteam of 4 Pratham members, including program leadership visited \nSoongachi, Naxalbari, Kakarvita & Cooch Behar tea estates in March \n2022. The team interacted with the sarpanch & gram-panchayat members \nand conducted 3 focused group discussions with the youth & their parents \non their current employment situation, aspirations and challenges. Most \nof the youth majorly belonged to SC/ST sections with someone from their \nfamily working in a tea garden. Some key insights from their discussions:\n1. Current Employment Status: While some youth were still studying, \nmajority of them had completed their 12th and graduation and were \nnot engaged in any employment activity. \n2. Aspiration: The youth showed disinterest towards working in tea-\ngardens and were looking for other job opportunities. However, they \nlacked exposure about jobs available in different sectors, how to access \nthem and industry requirements. There was a clear need for guidance \nand mentorship for these youth. \n3. Willingness to migrate for training & job: Majority of these youth \nshowed willingness to join a vocational training course near their \ncommunities and migrate for a job opportunity within Bengal. \nHospitality, Automotive 4W, Healthcare and electrical trades were \nsome of the most chosen preferences of these youth. \n4. Workforce demand: The tea-gardens being a tourist attraction, there is \nmassive demand for hospitality staff. Interaction with a couple of \nautomotive showrooms and service dealerships and resorts reflected \nthe need for skilled staff within this region. Year 2 onwards electrical \ntrade will also be introduced based on a need assessment study \nconducted with industry partners. \n \nAnother interaction with Adivasi Vikas Parishad and SPAN NGO further \nemphasized livelihood related challenges, trafficking issues, mobility and \nconnectivity problems, education and healthcare related issues within the \nregion. While these interactions clearly indicate lack of awareness on \nvocational training led employment pathways, Pratham will conduct a \ndetailed need assessment survey both in the community and with industry \npartners in North Bengal to understand aspirations and needs in greater \ndepth. The survey will also capture potential job opportunities within tea \nmanufacturing units. Insights from this detailed survey will feed into the \nprogram design. \n \nOak Application Form     9\nBased on Pratham\u2019s experience of 17 years training over 1,75,000 rural \nyouth across India, we propose  a  community-focused youth training \ninitiative in Hospitality and Automotive 4W trades in Year 1 and Electrical \ntrade in Year 2 of the engagement with the youth.\n Following are the key components of the programs:\n \nBuilding Awareness : Mentors will interact with youth, panchayat and \ncommunity leaders spreading awareness on career pathways through \nvocational training focusing primarily on communities working in the tea \ngarden areas of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri, Coochbehar, \nUttar Dinajpur and Dakshin Dinajpur districts of North Bengal region. \nGroup meetings, skill-melas, video testimonials of Pratham\u2019s alumni will be \nleveraged to build awareness. At this stage, youth will be enrolled in Level \n1 -7-day long self-placed digital courses giving exposure to 7 different \nindustry trades and potential job opportunities within them. \nTraining \u2013 Conducted in a hybrid approach, the core training includes two \ncomponents namely, Level 2 (virtual sessions) and Level 3 (in-person \npractical sessions). The entire training spans roughly 45-60 days. \nJob Placements- Trained youth will be oriented with available job \nopportunities within Hospitality and Automotive sectors. Pratham \nnegotiates with its placement partners for salaries and additional benefits- \nfood, accommodation and transportation allowance for its trainees. Youth \nwill be guided throughout the interview and joining process. \nPost-Placement Tracking: To ensure continued retention in employment, \nPratham reaches out to each trainee every 3 months, for a period of 1 year, \ncollecting 110+ data points tracking their employment status and need for \nfurther placement assistance.", "6.

Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or \ntest through this grant.\n(300 words):\nMeasurement is an integral part of all Pratham programs. Be it internal \nmeasurement, or external evaluations such as by government assessment \nagencies and industry sector bodies, Pratham has established a strong culture \nof capturing and using data rigorously to demonstrate impact over the past \nseveral years.\nIn 2013, Pratham set up a separate Measurement, Monitoring and Evaluation \n(MME) Unit to be able to systematically carry out a set of planned evaluations \nto measure and track progress and impact.  This evidence is now internally \nanalyzed to understand the strengths and shortcomings of Pratham\u2019s \nprograms, and to assist in developing solutions to improve the effectiveness of \nthe programs.\nA key measure of our impact is the number of youth trained that retain jobs \nbeyond 6 months \u2013 this is a measure we have adopted above and beyond the \nstandard metrics of training and placement that are the norms for the sector. \nWe are also trying to use the insights from our measurement of impact to get \na similar measurement adopted by the entire ecosystem.\nCurrently, Pratham gathers both quantitative and qualitative information \nabout all students enrolled at the training center. At each of the centers, \nOak Application Form     15\nconcerned staff will gather extensive background details such as family \nincome, educational qualifications and fee status of each student which will \nthen be compiled in the \u2018Salesforce\u2019 Management Information System \n(MIS). The reports generated will include both Quantitative Metrics (such as \nthe number of students enrolled, trained, certified, and supported as \nentrepreneurs, as well as retention and dropout rates) and Qualitative Data \nabout the social and economic impact of our programs (e.g. through student \ncase studies). Entrepreneurs are also tracked on a monthly basis once \nsupported, for the period of a year, to better understand their progress and \nany challenges faced. The Central Team provides them with ongoing support \nand mentorship during this period.\nData Checks through Internal Dashboard: Pratham uses Salesforce to \ncapture all center & student level data. Pratham has developed centralized \nmonitoring and reviewing through an advanced dashboard (on Salesforce) to \nmonitor progress of the centers. This helps us to monitor the data at the micro \nlevel and take actions as required. Pratham has developed an independent \naudit team responsible for planned and impromptu audits at the center level. \nThey are responsible for overall quality check with a comprehensive \nchecklist and feedback mechanism. Supporters are also encouraged to visit \nthe Centers they sponsor and assess the impact their investment is having \nthrough this transformative educational and vocational training program.\nDaily monitoring process at centers: Regularized monitoring - The \nrationale is to get an understanding about the daily processes and activities \noccurring at the center. Through this we aim to collect data that represents \nstaff attendance, center photographs, student\u2019s mobilization, expense details, \netc.\nAll programs will be tracked throughout the year and an annual report will be \nsubmitted at the end of every year. Pratham will also share reports along with \ncase studies, videos and photographs. We are now planning to use apps to get \ninformation from centers, feedback from students, etc on a regular basis to \nensure better quality and checks. The center heads are required to fill the data \nlike no. of student\u2019s present, no. of staff present with an option to upload live \npictures on a daily basis.\n \nGiven that this will be our first project in the far north-east part of the country, \nwe will leverage this opportunity to learn in-depth about youth from this \nregion. We would like to learn about the aspirations of these youth and explore \nthe need for starting new vocational training programs/ entrepreneurship \nmodels suited specifically for this region. Periodic surveys and focused group \ndiscussions will be conducted to understand the target group of youth in \ngreater depth.", "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.

We encourage you to be \nopen to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your \noutcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? \n(300 words):\nThe project may entail the following risks.\n1.Timeline: Project may not be implemented as per timeline/schedule \nmentioned in the MoU due to operational challenges, unexpected \nholidays, local festivals, Government elections, environmental stresses.\nMitigation steps: Pratham will deploy monitoring checks at the center, state \nand central level at regular intervals to ensure that the proposed \nimplementation timeline is adhered to. The teams are committed to complete \nthe project on time as per the schedule of activities mentioned in the MoU.\n2.Operational Risks: Pratham could face challenges in terms of \nmobilization due to lack of willingness of rural youth to join employment \nor their families to allow them to seek employment. Challenges could \narise from resistance of employers to provide employment or food & \naccommodation to trainees under an on-site model. Trainees could also \ndropout from course mid training or not opt for job post training due to \npersonal or family problems.\nMitigation steps:  \nMobilization: Pratham will work towards creating awareness about the \nprogram through digital content to educate the community and youth about \nthe intricacies and realities of the program in order to augment mobilization \nefforts.\nEmployer Support: Pratham will consistently engage with placement \npartners by inviting them for interviews, and guest lectures at the residential \ntraining centres or through virtual sessions to convince them on Pratham\u2019s \npedagogy of teaching and training model. This will enable the placement \npartners to understand the quality of training provided and the skills of the \ntrainees, thereby getting their buy-in to come on board for the onsite model.\nDrop-Out: With an on-site model, there is daily interaction through virtual \nclasses with the Pratham team, in-person interaction during counseling \nsessions conducted weekly/fortnightly. Trainees are also personally attended \nto in case of any issues or difficulties they come across during the training.", "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11.  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS\nPlease use this space to respond to any specific questions from your Oak \nprogramme officer. If none were received, please leave this section blank. \nOak Application Form     17\na. What are the systemic level changes that may be achieved in the \nlong run? The programme needs to evolve from a service delivery \nmode to a more systemic change mode that will position the \nprogramme as a replicable and scalable model for adoption in the \nskilling landscape in India.\nOn a national level, India has taken a Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) \napproach to fulfill the skill development mission in partnership with \nindustry sectors. The PPP model offers the public sector potential cost, \nquality and scale advantages in achieving service targets.\nSince inception in 2015, Pratham\u2019s delivery model of community \nmobilization, residential training at the center with industry vetted \ncurriculum and job placement as an end outcome has scaled from 1 to 130 \ncenters across 15 states in India. Since the pandemic, Pratham has \npivoted to a hybrid skilling model integrating familiar technology and \ntracking systems to provide skill training and help youth sustain in \nemployment.\nThe reach and scale has become 3xmore than what was possible through \ndoor-to-door physical mobilization. In tandem with the national approach \nexcluding public entity involvement at the delivery stage, Pratham \nleverages its strong community engagement initiatives making the model \nsustainable in the long-run.The hybrid skilling model can be easily \nreplicated through capacity building of teams on digital tools & data-\ndriven approaches.\nCan you please try to elaborate on the benefits for the community \nand how the programme can be positioned in the donor landscape \nfor generating more funding traction?\nThe skilling program of Pratham is currently aligned with Goal 8 of SDGs. \nThe Skilling program not only imparts vocational skills to the youth but \nalso has multifold impact on the entire community. To begin with the \ndirect beneficiary, the youth themselves receive an holistic education \nwhen ongoing training (including life skills, financial literacy, and many \nmore). This prepares them for the outside world learning to manage \nthemselves away from the family. As our model demands them to stay out \nof home for a certain period of time this allows them to become more \nconfident about themselves.\nNecessary awareness of other available employment opportunities will \nhelp provide direction with regard to proper skilling of the youth in \nreference to their profession of choice. Financial literacy skills (inculcated \nwithin the skilling programs) will help foster fiscally sound decisions with \nregard to their money. Moreover, financial literacy has a significant \nimpact on families as this knowledge helps balance family budgets, \nensuring proper utilization of funds for household necessities, health \ninsurance, children\u2019s education, retirement etc.\nSeeing this, the community is encouraged to send more youth to such \nprograms.\nPratham evolved its approach of training when the pandemic hit. From a \nresidential model Pratham moved to a hybrid model using the center, \ncommunity spaces and placement partner properties as a space for \npractical training. This enabled Pratham to enter communities and \nOak Application Form     18\ninteract with the people directly. This shift in strategy allowed Pratham to \nreach out to more villages and increase its presence.\nAs most of the funding is received from CSRs and Foundations with an \nobjective to promote livelihood and sustainable economic growth, the \nPratham skilling model ensures visible indicators of impact, focussing on \nemployability status, income generation and industry absorption. As most \nof Pratham\u2019s work focuses on skilling of youth these programs allow \ninteraction with organizations in a capacity of volunteering and employee \nengagement. Direct interaction through motivational speeches, life skills, \nwork ethics, etiquette, interview preparations are possible in this model.\n \nb. There is a scope to align the cross-sectoral impact of this \nprogramme on reducing instances of unsafe/distress migration and \ntrafficking, education attainment and collectivization of youth. \nThese may therefore be further elaborated with clear objectives \nwhich can uniquely position the programme as a skilling \nprogramme with multi-dimensional impact. \u2013 You can try to include \nthis as one of the project objectives and state the collaboration that \ncan be attained with the other Oak grantees working in the North \nBengal tea garden space.\n \nPratham\u2019s model of skilling not only imparts vocational skills to the youth \nbut also has multifold impact on the entire community.\n1.Alternative income source: Additional income inflow into families \nthrough youth taking up formal jobs will help improve the overall \nstandard of living of these communities, aiding in better healthcare \nfacilities  and schooling opportunities for children.\n2.Counseling support: Physical presence of a training center will serve \nas a hub for all kinds of information support for skilling and \nemployment opportunities. The team will  be instrumental in \ncounseling youth and young children towards available career \npathways and help mitigate trafficking activities in the vicinity.\n3.Boost to local economy: Youth who wish to opt for self-employment \nwill be guided to start their own enterprises.\n4.Financial Literacy: Imparted to youth during the skilling programs \nwill help foster fiscally sound decisions with regard to their money. \nSuch knowledge will help balance family budgets, ensuring proper \nutilization of funds for household necessities, health insurance, \nchildren\u2019s education, retirement etc.\n5.Building youth community volunteers: A unique \u2018Education for \nEducation\u2019 model will be linked to the vocational training program for \nthe youth. The intent is to make the youth a key stakeholder in the \nlearning curve of children of the community. In exchange for the \nvocational training modules, youth will be trained to deliver short \ninterventions for the children of the community to build and enhance \ntheir basic foundational skills of reading and arithmetic.\n \nOak Application Form     19\n     c. Since the vocational training programme will be launched in a \nnew geography, it will be good to document the evolution (programme \nlaunch, challenges, opportunities and risks and success) of past \ntraining programmes in similar geographies characterized by skills \ngaps, location remoteness and technological limitations. Have such \nprogrammes yielded positive results? If so, what have been the \ncontributing factors? \u2013 Can you therefore state the experience of \nPratham in launching such programmes in new geography and the \noverall experience and the successes/challenges?\n \nEvery geography represents a unique culture and has its own \nadvantages and constraints. Pratham has always adopted an inclusive \napproach, tailoring the model based on the needs of a specific region. \nPratham\u2019s vocational training initiatives in Gadchiroli, a tribal region in \nMaharashtra started in 2012 in collaboration with the forest and police \ndepartments. An inclusive counseling approach and facilitation of \ntransportation for tribal youth to training centers in Maharashtra \nhelped increase receptiveness among the tribal population. 5000+ \nyouth have been trained so far from Gadchiroli in hospitality, \nconstruction and automotive trades who went on to pursue formal \nentry-level jobs post training. This approach was also recognized \nthrough the PM\u2019s award for public administration awarded to District \nAdministration for the innovative partnership with Civil Society.\nSome factors that are unique to Pratham\u2019s model and have been \nsuccessful  across different states in India have been illustrated below:\n \n1.Strong Community Engagement: Pratham\u2019s mentors ( community \nmobilizers) engage extensively with all community stakeholders- \nsarpanch, self-help groups, community leaders and households on a \nregular basis. Community meetings, fairs, rallies, learning activities \nwith children are some of the mediums through which members of the \ncommunity are engaged and informed about Pratham\u2019s education and \nskilling interventions. Together with the education programs, \nPratham\u2019s presence is spread across 20,000 communities in 17 states \nacross the country. Pratham has built strong volunteer networks within \nthese communities who form an integral part of the intervention and \nhelp sustain the initiatives in the long-run.\n2.Detailed Need Assessment Survey: Pratham conducts needs \nassessment surveys within the community and with industry partners of \nthe region before initiating a new program. The survey helps \nunderstand the demographic profile and  aspirations of youth in \ngreater depth along with industry demand for different job roles in the \nregion. This helps in designing the program and adopt an inclusive \napproach considering region specific challenges. The team also visits \nand interacts with local stakeholders and organizations working in the \nregion to understand the local context in more depth.\n3.Counseling : Pratham\u2019s experience over the past decade has re-\naffirmed the importance of counseling time and again- not only of the \nskilling aspirant but of his/her family and the community in general in \nOak Application Form     20\nthe entire skilling value chain. The process of counseling is therefore \ndeeply embedded at every step of the skill training, placement and \nalumni engagement levels. There are different stakeholders involved at \neach level and the nature and approach is customized to suit the need \nof the time. Overall, 10 hours\u2019 worth of counseling is done beginning \nfrom mobilization, training and placement. Alumni engagement \ninvolves periodic contact with the graduates with the frequency varying \nbased on the need of the hour in addition to the structured group \nevents held at each location.\n4.Practical Hands-on Training: 15 days of the Level 3 course module \nis based on practical training which offers a unique opportunity for \nyouth to learn real-life application of trade specific skills. This helps \ntrainees get a first-hand experience of a work-place scenario helping \nthem transition smoothly into formal work environments as soon as \nthey graduate.\n5.Content Innovation: Pratham has digitized all its training content and \nreading material and uploaded the entire package on Pratham Open \nSchool Platform for ease of accessibility by trainees. Youth can visit the \nsite and refer to the content at all times. Further, Pratham\u2019s trainers \nthemselves have created interesting videos taking inspiration from \nreal-life situations which are uploaded on the open school site and \nshared with trainees as well. These help to create more relatable \nexperience for youth helping them grasp technical knowledge faster.\n6.Data-driven systems: Every program is designed based on evidence \nfrom data and decision-making at every step is highly data-driven.\nChallenges:\nThe project may entail the following risks.\n1.Timeline: Project may not be implemented as per timeline/schedule \nmentioned in the MoU due to operational challenges, unexpected \nholidays, local festivals, Government elections, environmental stresses.\nMitigation steps:\nPratham will deploy monitoring checks at the center, state and central \nlevel at regular intervals to ensure that the proposed implementation \ntimeline is adhered to. The teams are committed to complete the project on \ntime as per the schedule of activities mentioned in the MoU.\n2.Operational Risks: Pratham could face challenges in terms of \nmobilization due to lack of willingness of rural youth to join \nemployment or their families to allow them to seek employment. \nChallenges could arise from resistance of employers to provide \nemployment or food & accommodation to trainees under an on-site \nmodel. Trainees could also dropout from course mid training or not opt \nfor job post training due to personal or family problems.\nMitigation steps:  \nMobilization: Pratham will work towards creating awareness about the \nprogram through digital content to educate the community and youth \nabout the intricacies and realities of the program in order to augment \nmobilization efforts.\nOak Application Form     21\nEmployer Support: Pratham will consistently engage with placement \npartners by inviting them for interviews, and guest lectures at the \nresidential training centers or through virtual sessions to convince them on \nPratham\u2019s pedagogy of teaching and training model. This will enable the \nplacement partners to understand the quality of training provided and the \nskills of the trainees, thereby getting their buy-in to come on board for the \nonsite model.\nDrop-Out: With an on-site model, there is daily interaction through virtual \nclasses with the Pratham team, in-person interaction during counseling \nsessions conducted weekly/fortnightly. Trainees are also personally \nattended to in case of any issues or difficulties they come across during the \ntraining.\n \n \nd. The possibility of increasing the co-funding during the course of \nthe programme. Since there is an increasing amount of funding that \nis being directed to skilling programmes in India, there should be a \nclear goal in generating more interest among other donors for \nfunding the skilling programme for youth of the tea gardens. \u2013 Can \nyou state (the source may not be mentioned immediately, if not \ndecided) on how Pratham intends to leverage co-funding for this \nprogramme and also state any avenues which may be explored \njointly by Oak and Pratham to generate funding availability for the \nskilling programmes?\n \nPratham is expanding presence in the Eastern part of India. Pratham actively \napproaches existing and new CSRs and Foundations for expansion in newer \nregions. With the support of Oak, Pratham skilling will be able to show \npresence in the tea garden belt attracting the current and the new CSRs to \nsupport programs in this specific belt.\nUsually when ventured into a new geography, Pratham announces its \nexpansion to donors via emails, newsletters, referrals, social media posts, \nfurther application for proposals, etc. This usually generates interest in \ndonors fleshing out to a partnership.\nPratham also plans to leverage on the existing networks of Oak with other \nnon-profits or funding organizations to expand the scope of funding. This will \nallow Pratham to expand its network and create financial or knowledge \nbased partnerships as required.\n \n \n \n \n \nOak Application Form     22", "12. DECLARATIONS": "12.

Context (The context section should not exceed two pages.)\n6a. Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, \ngovernance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nNazdeek is a women-led legal empowerment organization founded in 2012 by \nJayshree Satpute, Sukti Dhital, and Francesca Feruglio. Throughout their \nprevious litigation and field-work, they realised that marginalised communities \nwere being denied knowledge and access to crucial administrative and non-\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20135\njudicial grievance redressal mechanisms. Therefore, Nazdeek was founded to \nensure community agency and access to justice.\nNazdeek\u2019s current Board: \n\u2022Sukti Dhital (President and Treasurer) \n\u2022Pragya Nair, Taryn Eckstein, Jameen Kaur, and Trusha Mehta (Directors) \nBoard members are offered a two-year position with the possibility of extension. \nSince our founding we have cycled off two former board members. These positions \nwere filled by our current board members. In September 2021, we plan to invite \nCo-founder and Advisor, Francesca Feruglio, to join as a Director.\nBoard members provide critical guidance and strategic support. They connect \nNazdeek to potential funding opportunities, strategic partners, and review \nfinancial and strategic plans. Certain members have additional responsibilities, \ne.g. the Treasurer reviews balance sheets, 990 tax filings and signs relevant \nagreements, and the President liaisons closely with Nazdeek\u2019s team, organizes \nboard meetings and reviews other documents.\nJayshree guides Nazdeek\u2019s overall strategic planning and management. \nTeam Nazdeek: \n\u2022Director \n\u2022Senior Program Officer \n\u2022Senior Litigation Officer \n\u2022Program Officer \n\u2022Two Program Associates \n\u2022Three Community Mobilisers \n\u2022Office Assistant \nAdditionally, there are other support staff including accountants, consultants, and \ninterns. Our network of 55 community paralegals and grassroots organization \npartners  informs our project strategies, and leads community-level organizing and \nadvocacy efforts. When strategically required, Nazdeek utilizes the support of pro \nbono lawyers. We are divided into three project teams: Delhi, Assam and Tamil \nNadu.\nNazdeek\u2019s management and decision-making process is participatory. Team \nleaders, teams, and paralegal volunteers collaborate on strategies and \ninterventions. Nazdeek encourages its team\u2019s wellness and professional \ndevelopment by providing relevant opportunities.\n \n \n \n \n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\n6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\nOperating costs and funds: \nNazdeek started in 2012 through crowdfunding. Since 2014, we successfully \nsecured long-term funding, and periodic short-term grants. Nazdeek\u2019s \norganisational budget for 2020-2021 is $250,000, including grants from various \nfunders since: \n\u2022Amplify Change, in partnership with Swadhikar- May 1, 2016\n\u2022Every Mother Counts (core funding)- May 15, 2014 \n\u2022Laudes Foundation- January 1, 2021 \n\u2022Namati- November 15, 2020 \n\u2022The Fund for Global Human Rights (core and project funding)- May 29, \n2014 \nThese funders have made long-term commitments to legal empowerment work, \nand have aided in strengthening Nazdeek. We also receive \napproximately  $15,000-20,000 annually through individual donations towards \nprograms. \nFundraising strategy:\nOur fundraising needs are identified based on Nazdeek\u2019s organisational vision \nand mission, and an annual strategic assessment of organisational priorities, \ncombined with community, partner organization, and paralegal needs. While no \none staff member is dedicated to fundraising, all co-founders, board members, \nand staff members play a key role in fundraising, including identifying potential \ndonors and writing and pitching proposals.\nWe are occasionally forwarded opportunities by our existing funders. We \napproach individual donors through fundraising campaigns to account for \ncontingencies. \nReserve Funds and Debts: \nNazdeek\u2019s current reserve is approximately $75,000 and there are no outstanding \ndebts. \nExpected Changes: \nThe Oak Foundation Grant will enhance our organisational budget significantly, \nenabling us to realise our vision of introducing our model to other Indian states; \nundertaking national-level policy advocacy; elevating FRTW from an Indian to \nan international coalition; and expanding our team. These goals align with the \nobjectives and strategies in our grant proposal. Nazdeek\u2019s organisation budget \nis expected to reach $715,000 by the end of 2024 due to expanded support from \none of our current funders and being in an advanced stage of a long-term \nfunding application process.\nNOTE: The proposed project will be undertaken in partnership with host \norganisation/s.\n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nNazdeek has successfully worked towards bringing access to justice closer to \nmarginalised communities across South Asia. Since 2012, working closely with \nAdivasi worker communities, we have conducted numerous trainings to expand \nworkers\u2019 knowledge of socio-economic, labour, and maternal health rights. \n\u2022Our training aided activists in their fight for a higher minimum wage for tea \nplantation workers, securing a historic 77% increase in daily wages for \n800,000 tea plantation workers in Assam. Following our efforts providing \ntraining, conducting community meetings, and advocating for workers, the \nAssam government\u2019s Minimum Wage Advisory Committee recommended \nanother wage increase of 110% (from Rs. 167 to Rs. 351) in 2018.\n\u2022Evidence from our human rights fact-finding investigations and monitoring, \nsuch as EndMMNow, supported successful filing of complaints by workers \nto secure their rightful food, health, housing, and labour benefits. \n\u2022Nazdeek also amplified community voices nationally and globally through \npublished reports: \u201cNo Time to Lose: Fighting Maternal and Infant Mortality \nthrough Community Reporting\u201d (2015), \u201cA Matter of Life and Death: \nSurviving Childbirth on Assam\u2019s Tea Plantations\u201d (2018), \u201cHidden Traumas: \nUncovering Experiences of Obstetric Violence\u201d (2020), and \u201cRising \nStronger: Security Strategies for Women Defenders\u201d (2020). \n\u2022Our research in Assam and greater South Asia was also critical in our \nfounding of the FRTW in 2019, a first of its kind forum for advancing the \nrights of tea plantation workers. \n\u2022In Delhi, working with 6 socio-economically marginalised communities, \nNazdeek\u2019s 35 presently-active paralegal volunteers have ensured basic \nentitlements such as community clinics and Anganwadi Centers, and \nhousing, water and sanitation rights for over 15,000 residents. \n\u2022Since 2020, Nazdeek and partners have provided COVID-19 humanitarian \nrelief to over 25,000 individuals in Assam, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu. \n\u2022Nazdeek\u2019s work was recognised with the Namati Grassroots Justice Prize in \n2015 and World Justice Prize in 2019.\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nNazdeek\u2019s legal empowerment model places the communities we work with at \nthe center of our work. We aspire to build leadership among women for greater \nparticipation in decision-making at the community, state, and policy-making \nlevels. Nazdeek\u2019s sustainability strategy creates an advocacy and outreach model \nowned by the community, which thrives without our presence. \nStrategy:\n1. Identifying communities after detailed scoping, assessment, and needs-\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\nmapping. Through community meetings and partnerships with \nlocal organizations, we explain our model and invite participants for \ntrainings. We prioritize outreach in communities marginalised on the basis \nof social identities like caste, class, religion, migration, and work status. \n2. Training participants, predominantly women, to be community paralegals \nand equipping them with administrative and judicial tools for addressing \nrights violations. Using participatory methods, we ensure inclusive and \nsafe training spaces for participants. \n3. Assisting paralegals in using grievance redressal, policy advocacy, and \nstrategic litigation tools. \n4. At every stage, paralegals and communities decide their priorities and \ninitiatives. We assess risks and identify mitigation strategies collectively, \nprioritising their safety and security. \n5. Eventually, paralegals undertake community meetings independently, \nstrengthening their human rights documentation and advocacy skills. \nNazdeek then moves to an advisory role. \n6. To support the long-term work of paralegals and connect community action \nto regional initiatives, we facilitate formation of coalitions. \n7. Paralegals work on a voluntary basis and are not paid an honorarium. This \naligns with Nazdeek\u2019s objective of building community leadership, \nagency,  and ownership of initiatives. Nazdeek does provide them \ncertificates and supports them by sharing opportunities, relevant \ngovernment schemes, and needs-based communications reimbursements.\nSince early 2020, due to the pandemic, we have employed several tools to \ncontinue engagement remotely. While we prioritise in-person visits, we have \nnow developed novel modes of outreach and maintained our strategy despite \nthe crisis.\n \n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nTea plantation workers across South Asia experience dismal living and working \nconditions, earn meagre wages, and face ineffectual labour law protections. In \nIndia, where tea plantation workers are predominantly Adivasi (indigenous) and \nwomen, these conditions have led to an intergenerational cycle of oppression and \npoverty. \nKey issues faced: \n\u2022Currently, corporations function in the roles previously held by colonial \npowers, and are primarily responsible for the poor housing, wages, health \ncare, food, water, and sanitation experienced by tea plantation workers. \n\u2022Workers are not paid a legal minimum wage, sufficient to ensure basic \nnecessities for themselves and their families. \n\u2022Women do not receive sufficient medical care, especially pre- and post-natal \nmaternal healthcare, leading to extremely high rates of anaemia, and high \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139\nmaternal and infant mortality on tea plantations.\nNazdeek, with its partner organizations, has aided workers in addressing these \nproblems and issues. However, recent circumstances have worsened this \nsituation. \nChallenges: \n\u2022Due to the current political situation in India, organisations and individuals \ndoing cutting edge rights work face a higher risk of coercive actions. \nPlantations have become inaccessible due to greater surveillance by their \nmanagement. \n\u2022While the pandemic has opened up new ways of communicating for the rest \nof the world, our project communities have very limited access to electricity, \ngadgets, and the internet. \n\u2022The Central government has repealed and replaced 29 previous national \nlabour laws with just 4 labour codes. While the previous laws did not \nprovide robust worker protections, certain laws such as the Plantations \nLabour Act, did ensure specific protections for workers on tea plantations. \n\u2022Employers have taken advantage of the current legal ambiguities, wherein \nold laws have been repealed, but the new laws are not yet in force, further \nlimiting the rights of workers on tea plantations. \n\u2022Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an even more dire \nsituation for tea workers, as the pandemic-induced lockdown has created \nfood scarcity as government-run ration shops and health centers remain \nclosed or under-operational. Conversely, tea workers continue to be forced \nto work despite the pandemic and minimal safeguards on plantations. \nOpportunities: \nAddressing both the long-standing issues experienced by tea plantation workers \nand the new issues created by the pandemic is a struggle in the current legal and \npolicy climate. However, this also makes it an increasingly important time to \nmobilize workers and assist them in their advocacy, as workers have the \nopportunity to comment on proposed laws and shape local policy in an effort to \nstrengthen their legal rights. \n\u2022To overcome communication challenges, Nazdeek, its paralegals, and \ncommunities are adopting innovative methods. For example, we recently \nconducted 12 intensive online training sessions on labour laws with tea \nworkers in Assam. \n\u2022With Central and State governments currently drafting rules to the labour \nlaws, an opportunity has arisen for tea workers to engage in this process \nand to effect policy and legislative change. Nazdeek has therefore been \nfacilitating their participation through trainings, consultations, and FRTW, \nresulting in submission of 5 comments to draft rules. This has allowed wider \nstakeholder representation, and workers have gained confidence to engage \nin similar processes in the future. \n\u2022Due to the aforementioned threats, now is a critical time for tea plantation \nworkers\u2019 advocacy. Enhancing their advocacy skills will not only address the \nimmediate needs, but will also shape the future of tea workers\u2019 rights. \nLegislative and policy changes now will combat negative effects of India\u2019s \nnew labour laws, as workers will have stronger legal protections and better \navenues for demanding adequate wages, maternal health benefits, and \nimproved living and working conditions.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201310", "7.

Future Plans\nHow will the grant influence the organisation and future plans? (maximum \n300 words):\nFor over a decade, Nazdeek has been a key partner to workers\u2019 collectives and \nCSOs in the rights movements of tea plantation workers in India. The four new \nlabour codes, and related rules and policies, will have long-lasting effects on the \nrights of tea plantation workers. Nazdeek intends to continue working with \norganizations in Assam and replicate its legal empowerment model in West \nBengal, and across India through FRTW. This grant opportunity will enable \nNazdeek and our partners to affect the drafting and implementation of these new \nlaws across states. This will have a positive impact on workers\u2019 rights in the \nfuture. This grant will ensure that the communities Nazdeek works with will be in \nthe best position to defend their rights, as they will have developed the skill sets \nnecessary to advocate for themselves and will have strong legal protections on \nwhich to rely. Aside from Nazdeek\u2019s significant advocacy work in India, we have \nalso conducted scoping assessments of the rights of tea plantation workers in \nBangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Nazdeek is dedicated to supporting tea \nplantation workers in their advocacy, and it is critical that workers are organized \nat the national, regional, and international levels to ensure that the industry does \nnot move from one state or country with stronger labour policies to another state \nor country with weaker ones. A regional or international coalition and movement \nfocused on protecting the socio-economic and labour rights of tea workers is \nnecessary to accomplish this. Nazdeek plans to continue our work in strengthening \nand expanding the FRTW, to conduct national, regional and international \nadvocacy. This grant would allow Nazdeek to make significant progress in \ndeveloping this Forum, and further, will bring Nazdeek closer to our goal of \nultimately supporting a strong, international FRTW.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201318\nAdditionally, as Nazdeek scales up its legal empowerment model, we are also keen \nto further build our consultant's capacity and professional training on international \ncomplaints mechanisms, cross-country/regional learnings on grassroots \nempowerment models, subject area expertise, workflow management, \npsychosocial issues and stress management.

ICLEI \nSouth Asia - the South Asian arm of ICLEI - is a not for profit organization, \nwith the head office, located in Delhi, operational in India since 2005. There \nis a regional office in Hyderabad, state offices in Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore) \nand Gujarat (Ahmedabad), and several smaller project offices in different \ncities. We also have staff based in Bangladesh and Nepal. \nThree major achievements of ICLEI South Asia are:\n1.    Over 18 years, office staff strength has increased from 3 to 75, its \nOak Application Form     6\nturnover increasing steadily over the years from about INR 7 crores in 2010 \nto more than three times the value currently, and it has established itself as \na reliable technical support partner for several donor agencies such as GIZ, \nSDC, IDRC, ADB and others, with multiple projects implemented with their \nsupport over time. Its area of work has expanded from primarily energy \nrelated projects in 2005, to a wide variety, including climate resilience, \nwater, waste, urban mobility, urban biodiversity, knowledge brokering, \ngender and environment, among others. \n2.    ICLEI South Asia is empanelled with the National Water Mission of \nMinistry of Jal Shakti as a field agency to undertake work on water \nconservation, minimizing wastage and increasing water use efficiency \nthrough awareness and capacity building, encouraging local planning and \nparticipation. ICLEI South Asia is also an empanelled consultant for the \nGovernment of India\u2019s other flagship programmes such as the Swachh \nBharat Mission (national government empanelled consultants and state level \ncommittee member and facilitator in Rajasthan), Smart Cities Mission \n(empanelled consultant in 5 states) and HRIDAY Scheme (empanelled city \nanchor in 3 cities). \n3.

If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nThere is intense research on the pressing challenge of access to water and \nsanitation for tea estate workers and their families in Darjeeling and \nKurseong. The situation is also aggravated due to climate change. Climate \nimpacts of decreased rainfall and increased temperatures in the northern \npart of West Bengal are well recorded in the Indian Network for Climate \nChange Assessment (INCCA), 2010 and the West Bengal State Action Plan on \nClimate Change (SAPCC), 2017. Both reports suggest a decrease in overall \nrainy days and an increase of minimum and maximum temperatures for the \nregion. Such changes are not conducive for tea cultivation, and has resulted \nin increased dependency on local water reserves, natural streams and \nreservoirs. A Central Ground Water Board report from 2014 and a study by \nRai et al., 2016 suggest natural springs and their watersheds are inefficiently \nmanaged and facing degradation. Excessive extraction, coupled with limited \nrecharge or rejuvenation of natural reserves is leading to scarcity of water. \nThe scarce resource is also subject to degradation through extensive use of \nOak Application Form     7\nfertilizer, pesticides, and agrochemicals by the tea gardens and \nindiscriminate disposal of waste along the mountain slopes and often into the \nstreams. Since some sources of water are available seasonally, there is \ngreater likelihood of them being degraded during the dry spells. Apart from \nquality and quantity, reliable access to water is challenging as well, with tea \nestates, hotels promoting tea tourism, the managerial staff of tea estates, tea \nestate workers and local indigenous communities outside the tea estates all \ncompeting for the same scarce resource.  Even though it is evident that the \ntea estates play a pivotal role as major stakeholders in the water resources \nof the region, there appears to be a noticeable lack of engagement between \nthe tea estates and the ongoing initiatives of the government. This \ndiscrepancy underscores the critical importance of collaboration among \ndifferent stakeholders. \nThere are a number of schemes of the West Bengal government that are \nlooking at access to water, such as the Jal Dharo, Jal Bharo scheme, the \nJaltirtho schemes that are supporting micro-irrigation technologies, as well \nas water harvesting or storage structures. Some development schemes such \nas the Kanyashree, Lakshmi Bhandar or Chai Sundari schemes look at \nhousing, education or general social development. The current budget has \nallocated INR 823 crores for North Bengal development and more than INR \n1500 crores for water resources development for the fiscal year 2023-24. In \naddition, more than INR 1300 crores have been allocated to technical \ntraining and skill development.\nMore often than not, access to water is subject to an unwritten hierarchy \nwherein the indigenous community and the tea estate workers are at the \nbottom rung. Time and labour-intensive practice of fetching water from \nfaraway places, impacts women in particular from these communities. There \nare reports indicating that consumption of poor quality water or inadequate \nwater has impacted overall health and adaptive capacity of the workers and \nmarginalised local communities. \nICLEI\u2019s experience in the region also reflects these findings. Previous work \nin the region, including in Kurseong, has shown that local communities are \nrarely involved in the critical aspect of water resource management by local \ngovernments. This results in lack of ownership of water related projects and \nsubsequent lack of support by local communities. This means that eventually \nprojects may fall into disrepair, if local communities do not use them \nproperly and carefully. More importantly, the linkages of water resource \nconservation and solid waste management needs to be highlighted and dealt \nwith effectively to keep water resources clean and safe. Gender aspects of \nwater use and management is also not considered in the planning and \nimplementation of water projects.  \nThis project intends to tackle the water crisis faced by the local communities \nby using traditional knowledge and community led practices for rainwater \nharvesting, spring revival, reuse and upcycling of wastewater through \ncoordinated and collaborative efforts of the communities, the local \ngovernments and the private sector involving the tea estates and hotels. The \nproject envisages the crucial involvement of local communities, particularly \nwomen, right from the development of action plans, their implementation \nand monitoring as well as replication and scale up. A cadre of barefoot \nhydrogeologists will be trained from among the local communities, focusing \non local women and youth, giving them the necessary wherewithal to \nOak Application Form     8\nprepare basic water conservation plans and manage their resources in \ncollaboration with other stakeholders.", "6.

Objectives\nList here up to 3 main objectives for this grant (one sentence per objective). Think of objectives as goals \nthat can be achieved within the lifetime of the grant.  We encourage you to think of objective(s) that are \nambitious but also achievable.  \nThe project aims to create and institutionalize a replicable model for \ncommunity-led Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), to develop \nand implement Water Security Plans for tea estates that will help to improve \nthe quality, quantity, access and reliability of water for local communities. \nThe specific objectives of the project include: \n- To mobilise and build capacity of local indigenous community and migrant \ntea estate workers as barefoot hydrogeologists, who are able to assess water \nissues as well as design and implement locally-owned interventions that \npromote water conservation and rejuvenation, in collaboration with local \ngovernments and tea estate management. \n- To improve overall water availability and equitable access to water, thereby \nenhancing the adaptive capacity and resilience of local communities.\n- To create an institutional platform consisting of local governments, \ncommunity representatives, and tea estate management, for overall \nmanagement and robust monitoring of the implementation of water security \nplans, and ensure potential scale up and sustainability.\n \n7.b. Expected Outcomes (bullet points):\nWhat do you expect will change because of this grant? What does success look like?

Outcomes \ndescribe significant changes for people, communities, organisations or systems. Some \nOak Application Form     9\nexamples are changes in policies and legislation; changes in knowledge, awareness, \nattitudes, beliefs, behaviours or social norms; changes in capacities, level of influence, \nagency or access to services. Please refer to the guidance for additional examples.\nThe expected outcomes of the project are: \n- community led and managed water security plans institutionalized in at \nleast 4 tea estates, and adopted by the local governments in the region. \n- a cohort of barefoot hydrogeologists including women, formed and \ninstitutionalized in the region who can eventually not only identify local \nwater issues, but also design and implement interventions to address such \nissues and act as local ambassadors for water resource management. At least \nseven to ten  barefoot hydrogeologists in each tea-estate  to be trained and \ncapacitated. It is also envisaged that at least 50 percent of these barefoot \nhydrogeologists will be women.\n- locally responsive water conservation measures implemented \ncollaboratively by local communities, local governments and tea estate \nmanagement.\n- creation of a societal platform for local communities and tea estate \nmanagement to engage and influence the local governments for safe and \nsustainable water resources.\nIt is well acknowledged that enhancing water security positively influences \nvarious socio-economic and environmental aspects. In the project region, \nwomen typically are responsible for collection of water and enhanced water \nsecurity will reduce the workload for women, providing them with more time \nfor education, income-generating activities and community participation. \nTherefore, it is envisaged that the larger impact of the project will \nextend  beyond access to water, and will lead to improved health of women \nin particular but also their families, better access to sanitation, improved \nsolid waste management to clean up water resources, enhanced livelihoods, \nand, in general, lead to resilient communities. \n \n7.c.

This will be \nbased on several factors such as:\n-    Water resources: availability of basic information about water resources \nand associated issues, watershed area covered by the tea estates, \nperenniality etc.\n-    Tea estate: whether owned by the government or private; size of the tea \nestate; commitment and support from the tea estate management; support \nfrom the tea estate unions, proximity and connectivity among others.\nOak Application Form     10\n-    Local communities: size and type of the population, socio-economic \nconditions, marginalized and disadvantaged population especially women \n(e.g., migrant laborer, indigenous population), cultural and traditional \npractices among others\n-    Presence of Oak/non-Oak partners: opportunity to enhance the synergies \nbetween the existing organizations in the tea-estate to ensure maximum \nimpact\nA list of tea estates will be prepared and analyzed considering the above-\nmentioned parameters, and will be shared with the Oak Foundation for their \nreview and final selection. \n2. Baseline assessment (M2 - M8) - A baseline data assessment of water \nresource related data, hydro-geological mapping, demography, water use, \nwill be conducted to get ground level information through secondary data \ncollectionThe project team will conduct focused group discussions (FGDs) to \nverify the secondary information collected from different resources. \n3. Gap identification and vulnerability assessment (M6 - M15) - Identification \nof local issues and climate vulnerability of the regional water resources as \nwell as vulnerability of the local population will be studied. Through FGDs \nand stakeholder consultations, interventions will be identified to address the \nwater related issues of local communities, with emphasis on traditional \npractices to address issues on water conservation and management in the \nregion.  \n4. Training and capacity building of barefoot hydrogeologists (M10 - M30) - \nSelection of interested community members, including women and youth will \nbe conducted based on the interest of the local communities shown in the \nFGDs or other consultations. They will be trained as barefoot \nhydrogeologists and hand holding support will be provided to help them \ninstitutionalise the process of local water management.\n5. Development and government ratification of water security plans (M12 - \nM22) - Community led and managed water security plans will be prepared by \ninvolving all stakeholders including local communities, tea estate \nmanagement and local governments to identify possible interventions. \nOpportunities of funding the plans through government or private fund \nsources will be identified to facilitate its implementation.\n6. Identification and on ground implementation of pilots (M20 - M30) - Based \non local needs assessment, pilot projects will be selected by the local \ncommunities and barefoot hydrogeologists from the region for \nimplementation. The selected pilot will be determined from a range of \noptions identified in the water security plans developed. The local \ncommunities and barefoot hydrogeologists will identify traditional methods \nof water conservation and use, through FGDs that can be adapted and \nreplicated as pilot projects. The project team will facilitate the selection by \nproviding technical inputs.\n7. Institutionalisation and monitoring (M25 - M32) - A framework will be \ndeveloped for monitoring and used to monitor the implementation of the \npilots and the water security plans developed by the barefoot \nhydrogeologists and societal platform of different stakeholders \n8. Dissemination (M32 - M35) - Dissemination of the work and identification \nof replication opportunities will begin from the training phase, and continue \nthrough the project, but will be strengthened at the later stage of the \nproject.\n9. Reporting and publication (M35-M36) - Some publications are planned \nduring the project, particularly for recording the training process of the \nOak Application Form     11\nbarefoot hydrogeologists and the community level interventions \nimplemented; final reporting of project activities will be carried out at the \nend of the project.", "8. COOPERATION": "8. COOPERATION  \nHow will you involve others in your approach to achieving change? If you are \nplanning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived \nexperience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  \nWhy are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are \nchoosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you \nusually work? (300 words):\nThe project proposes to develop a collaborative platform to bring together \ndifferent stakeholders from government, private sector, NGOs and local \ncommunities (particularly women from indigenous and migrant communities) \nto develop, implement and monitor locally led and managed water security \nplans. The platform will facilitate interaction between the stakeholders to \nimplement and monitor actions on ground that promote water security that \ncan be scaled up regionally.\nThe information from the gap analysis in the water and sanitation systems \nand climate vulnerability assessment of the indigenous community, migrant \nworkers and existing water resources will be analysed to develop a climate \nresilient and equitable Community Led Water Security Plans (WaSP) through \nthis platform with full involvement of the local communities, particularly the \ncadre of trained barefoot hydrogeologists. ICLEI SA will consult with the \nlocal communities (particularly women), migrant workers, tea estate owners \nand local authorities through workshops and focused group discussions to \ndevelop a list of possible interventions, both infrastructural and non-\ninfrastructural. The plans will be ratified by the local governments through \ntheir councils to ensure government support, both through supportive \npolicies and possible funding programmes.\nThe Water Security Plans will be developed with particular focus on women, \nwho are largely responsible for household level management of water, but \nnot often engaged in the planning or management of the resources. In \naddition, tea estate management, being responsible for all actions within \ntheir estates, will be involved in the process for greater transparency and \nengagement. Local governments, responsible for water supply,will be \nengaged to collaborate and partner with the communities so that all actions \nare legitimate and acceptable to all parties. \nICLEI South Asia regularly works with different stakeholders, governments, \ncommunities and private sector to prepare and implement plans. Usually, \nmost of the focus is on engaging local governments, but in this case, the \nfocus will be on the local communities and enabling them to take \nresponsibility of their resources in collaboration with the government. \n \nOak Application Form     12", "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING \nThis section is twofold. Please tell us:\na) Monitoring and evaluation.

Please \ndescribe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is working. \nIf you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or \nconduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.\nb) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or \ntest through this grant.\n(300 words):\nA design and monitoring framework will be formulated to monitor the project \nprogress and success, clearly articulating the links between issues, \ninterventions, outputs, outcomes and ultimate impact in the context of \nensuring water security. The framework will have clearly specified, \nmeasurable, achievable targets such as number of households with improved \naccess to water/sanitation, amount/quality of water harvested, number of \ncommunity engagement events, number of barefoot hydrogeologists \n(especially women) trained, etc. The framework will articulate the ultimate \nimpact of the project on a larger scale such as improved public health, \nincreased environmental sustainability, and overall well-being of \ncommunities. The progress against each indicator will be monitored \ndepending on its objective, either monthly, bi-annually or annually.  \nThe framework will include elements to assess the gender and social \ninclusivity throughout the project cycle. A stakeholder group, composed of \nkey representatives from marginalized and indigenous populations, especially \nwomen, will be formed to act as a voice for the larger population. \nThe  stakeholders group will be involved throughout the planning and \nimplementation of the project. They will provide inputs to the formulation of \nWaSP, identifying potential interventions to enhance access to water as well \nas during the implementation and finally operation and maintenance. Open \ndialogues will be conducted with the targeted population to build trust and \nensure that selected interventions are responsive to the needs and \naspirations of the community.The process will include quantitative and \nqualitative information gathered from the beneficiaries through participatory \nmethods. Such qualitative information from the beneficiaries and \ncommunities can provide valuable insights and contribute to a more \ncomprehensive assessment of the project success.\nIn addition, a methodology will be identified that can be used periodically by \nthe platform of stakeholders to assess the implementation of the water \nsecurity plan and monitor it over time. The barefoot hydrogeologists will also \nbe trained on relevant and high-quality data collection for better monitoring. \nThe project will introduce and institutionalize a feedback loop mechanism \nwhere community feedback will be incorporated into ongoing MEL \nprocesses. Participatory workshops or Focus Group Discussions will be \nOak Application Form     13\norganized semi-annually to get their inputs. By integrating a monitoring \nframework into Water security plans, stakeholders can make informed \ndecisions, allocate resources effectively, and continuously improve strategies \nto ensure water availability and access for all while safeguarding the \nenvironment.\nThe project will embrace adaptive management principles to ensure that the \nplan remains relevant and effective in a dynamic environment. Regular \nreview meetings are planned with Oak Foundation to monitor progress and \noutputs and based on the findings, the team will make necessary adjustments \nto the project plan by modifying strategies, reallocating resources, or \nrevising targets.", "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGES\nWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your \noutcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?\nWe understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we \nexpect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be \nopen to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your \noutcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? \n(300 words):\nThe major risks identified for the project include: \n1. Non-cooperation by the tea estates: Lack of awareness, common interest, \ncompeting priorities or simply no interest towards the larger cause of \nenhancing water resilience can lead to non-cooperation by the tea estates. \nSince the project interventions are planned within the boundaries of selected \ntea estates, it is imperative to bring them on board. The project team will \nselect tea estates that are open minded and interested to improve the water \nresource situation during the initial assessment. Continuous engagement \nfrom the beginning throughout the project  will build their trust and sensitize \nthem toward the issue. \n2. Non-cooperation by the local communities: Building trust in external \npeople coming in to resolve local issues is not easy. The project team plans to \nextensively engage with the communities, including having local staff around \nfor continuous communication, so that trust can be built over time. \n3. Political changes: Changes in political leadership, lack of political will or \ncompeting priorities can impact the project implementation. Local \ngovernments will be engaged right from the beginning and a nodal official \nwill be identified for continuous communication. ICLEI\u2019s presence in the \nregion and previous connections will also be useful in this matter.\n4. Data and information gaps: Insufficient or unreliable data on water \nresources, usage, and quality can impact informed decision-making and \nplanning. In such a case, state or regional level data will be extrapolated.\n5. Financial constraints: Lack of funding or budgetary constraints can hinder \nthe implementation of necessary infrastructure and interventions for \nimproving water security. ICLEI is already making plans of applying for \nOak Application Form     14\nfunding from other sources and will also explore local government budgets, \nor state government schemes such as Jal Dharo, Jal Bharo or Jalatirtho will \nbe explored for possible funding.

Its vision has been to create a \nhumane social order based on truth, equity, freedom, and justice with special \nemphasis on women, children, and the vulnerable sections of society. Right \nfrom its inception IGSSS focuses on social equity and economic justice. And \nwe continue to work with the communities in marginal territories. In the last \n63 years, IGSSS has gone through various transitions. Till recently, we used \nto fund small NGOs but for the last two years, we have become a full-fledged \nimplementing organisation. And right now we are going through on \norganizational development process focusing on State based approach \nenabling state units as independent units.\nIGSSS is guided by an eminent board which meets every quarter to review \nand guide the organization.

Even though \nyou may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the \nproposed grant. (300 words)\nThe organization in the 1960s evolved as a financial grant-making agency \nwith a mandate to work against hunger and poverty. It initially began its \noperations as Indo-German Social Service Society working with the funds \nreceived through funding partners in Germany. In the 1980s the focus \nshifted to support projects in food production, health care and education, \nvocational training, employment, and rural development. The renowned \nSmile Programme (Student Mobilization Initiative for Learning through \nExposure) was also started as a national program by IGSSS in 1985. By the \n1990s, IGSSS expanded its presence from Delhi to pan India, opening \nOak Application Form     6\nregional offices. It moved from being a funding agency to a supporting \norganization with collaborations with other NGOs. In the post-2000s era, \nIGSSS turned a new leaf and adopted a more rights-based approach, \nunderwent an organizational development process, and changed in name, \nwith a renewed vision and mission and strategic thrust areas identified. The \norganization's name had evolved into the present Indo-Global Social Service \nSociety to reflect the association with global donors. It was in this phase that \nthe homeless program was initiated as a direct implementation. IGSSS in the \n2010s decade evolved as a leading grant-making organization in India \nsupporting smaller grass-roots NGOs across the length and breadth of the \ncountry. Since 2019 onwards, IGSSS has remodelled our work as an \nimplementing agency, with a new HR structure with state offices and digital \nstrengthening for a people-led global and grassroots action for a just society.\nIGSSS has been concerned with urban poverty since the turn of the \nMillennium. Working in over 35 cities, more than 200,000 families have \nbenefitted through 2015 \u2013 2020. IGSSS now has extensive experience in \nurban poverty interventions in India and is widely networked with existing \nCSO actors and movements. In our actions since 2018, we have gradually \ndeveloped our understanding of sustainability in the urban context and since \n2020, through Satat Shehar Programme (2020 \u2013 ongoing), we have through \nclimate vulnerabilities and impact lens started to mainstream climate action \nwith 260 urban poor communities leading the change. We are having \ninternal organizational experience working with rural climate change actions \nfor many decades and that is helping us immensely in the existing work. This \nintervention is spread across 13 cities in mostly north, central, and eastern \nIndian cities with a focus on slums and community development for Unnat \nBastis (developed\u2013model slums). We also have a climate change thematic, \nthat closely works with urban thematic to address urban poor / worker \nclimate change issues in the project actions. IGSSS is also working with \ngovernments across scales to push climate action and resilience building, \nsome efforts in Jharkhand, Kashmir, and Odisha are noteworthy. Aside from \nSatat shehar intervention, in December 2021, IGSSS embarked on initiating \na new project for informal workers under the title of Punarnirman (Build \nback better) (2021-ongoing) for informal workers and their issues of insecure \nlivelihoods, especially in the post \u2013 COVID phase in 160 worker collectives. \nThis intervention is spread across 8 cities in mostly north, central, and \neastern Indian cities.\nClimate resilience building for informal sector workers has been completely \nmissed in the state-led interventions till now. Our engagement with worker \ngroups shares the need for an increased focus on developing an \nunderstanding of climate impacts and building capacities to deal with them \nwill be critical for informal workers in India. We have made sufficient \nprogress on climate actions since 2020 in urban when we brought in climate \naction as part of urban interventions. In urban, we are working with the \nurban poor in behavioural aspects, as well as to secure their settlements. \nAnd are already collaborating with numerous experts and organizations on \nthe same.[1]  IGSSS is also increasingly taking up the role of policy \ndevelopment for climate actions through its participation in COP 26 and \nother national/international platforms to amplify the needs and requirements \nof urban poor constituents. Lately, we have pushed climate action for \ninformal workers in our national networking meeting under the Punarnirman \nproject action and have just initiated small studies to assess the loss and \nOak Application Form     7\ndamage of informal workers; and propose/ frame actions/ policies for \ndifferent workers to deal with climate impacts.\nIGSSS interventions in the last many years have seen dozens of policy \nchanges at the state and national levels and successful model interventions \u2013 \nincluding the successful policy contributions that transformed into guidelines \nthrough NULM-SUH, welfare measures for urban poor - homeless during \nCOVID, PMSVANIDHI, and other numerous policy improvements.  Recently \nIGSSS along with informal worker leaders and federations of hawkers, met \nrepresentatives of ILO and NitiAyog to push the climate impact agenda of \ninformal workers into policy action. In April 2023, IGSSS was also made a \ntask-force member for NULM 2.0 redrafting process. by MoHUA. It is needed \nthat urgently, in this phase of India\u2019s policy development towards climate \nresilience, urban informal workers and their impacts, and loss are \nhighlighted to make the policy framework inclusive.  \n[1] IGSSS through its much older rural work on climate change, and now \nincreasing work on urban climate action is already in collaboration with \norganizations like CANSA, TERI, INECC and so on.\n \n5c.

(600 words):\nContext\nInformal workers form the mainstay of the Indian economy. They constitute a \nsignificant portion of the Indian workforce, estimated to be around 90% of \nthe total workforce.[1] Yet they face a lack of job security, low wages, and \npoor working conditions. They are also not eligible for benefits such as \npension, insurance, and paid leave, which are available to formal sector \nworkers. The live-work conditions of informal workers, especially in cities are \nan ignored reality wherein the formal state-led (exclusionary) urban vision \nhas neglected the settlements that house the informal workers. Whilst there \nare initiatives taken by the state to bring the workers\u2019 rights under a broad \numbrella of reformed legislations to provide social security to informal \nworkers, the coverage is still limited and restricted, and not holistic.[2]\nThe COVID pandemic has ruptured the status quo and lifted the veil on the \nfault lines in our society. The crisis uncovered the sheer lack of security \u2013 \nsocial and economic \u2013 and the mere reach that the state extended on its \nvulnerable people. The pandemic began in the cities in India. The hardest hit \nis the most \u2018invisible\u2019 poor \u2013 informal workers, migrant workers and marginal \ngroups living in slums and other makeshift dwellings, across urban \ngeographies.  As the economy is gradually returning to normalcy, in the post-\npandemic era, numerous initiatives with a climate resilience perspective are \nbeing undertaken at a national level including dovetailing existing \nOak Application Form     8\ndevelopment\u2013infrastructure programs into climate change discourse. \nUnfortunately, very less of this is concerned with urban informal workers' \nlivelihoods and life in the city.\nSituation Analysis: Assessing the situation of workers in the Kolkata \nMetropolitan Area\nThe Kolkata Metropolitan Area is a metropolitan area in the Indian state of \nWest Bengal, centred around the city of Kolkata (also known as Calcutta). It \nis the largest urban agglomeration in the eastern part of India and the third \nlargest in the country, housing over 14.85 million people, as of the 2011 \ncensus. The Kolkata Metropolitan Area is comprised of the city of Kolkata, its \nsuburbs, several neighbouring towns (including 4 municipal corporations, \nand 27 municipalities) and adjoining rural areas. It is the economic, cultural, \nand educational hub of eastern India and hosts several major commercial \nand industrial centres, making it one of the most important economic zones \nin India.[3]\nInformal workers like street vendors, domestic workers, construction \nworkers and waste pickers are expected to be around 20 - 25 lakh (over 2 \nmillion) in a similar situation as other parts of the country, without much \nsocial security and living in the margins of the current developmental \ndiscourse. The KMA also has a large informal sector that employs a \nsignificant number of migrant workers, particularly in construction, domestic \nwork, and small-scale industries. These workers face compounded challenges \nsuch as low wages, long working hours, and poor working conditions. Many \nof them live in makeshift housing and lack access to basic amenities like \nclean water, sanitation, and health care. Migrant workers face social \nchallenges, such as discrimination, isolation, and limited access to education \nand health services. It is estimated that around 50% of the informal workers \n(1 million) are migrants, with an equal percentage from other districts of \nBengal and migrants from other states like Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, and \nAssam. An equal or similar share of outmigration is reported as well.[4]\nThe Kolkata Metropolitan Area is also located precariously. Like many other \ncoastal cities in the world, is facing a range of impacts from climate change \nand is listed in the top eight megacities to be first impacted by climate \nchange. The city is in the deltaic region of eastern India, which makes it \nvulnerable to sea level rise and increased frequency and intensity of extreme \nweather events such as tropical cyclones, heavy rainfall, and heat waves.[5] \nThe changing climate is leading to an increased risk of coastal flooding and \nerosion, as well as water scarcity, particularly during the dry season. The \ncity's infrastructure and public services, including transportation, energy, \nand water systems, are also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, \nwhich can strain these systems and result in economic losses. In addition to \nthe physical impacts, the changing climate also has social and economic \nimpacts on the people of the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. The most impacted \nareas overlapping directly with the informal worker settlements in the region \nare vulnerable to displacement, loss of livelihoods, and increased poverty \nbecause of climate change.\nTo address these challenges, the government in the Kolkata Metropolitan \nArea, led by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation are taking steps to increase \nthe region's resilience to climate change. This includes implementing flood \ncontrol measures, improving disaster preparedness and response, investing \nin climate-resilient infrastructure, and preparing climate action plans for \nOak Application Form     9\ntheir cities.[6][7] The major concern in the slew of positively directed actions \nis that informal workers, their live-work settlements and their livelihoods as \nof now are not a major focus area of the climate resilience actions pushed by \nthe state and authorities. Thereby ignoring the most vulnerable, impacted \ninformal workers from the climate resilience action plans for the region. Also \nstraight-jacketed approaches of focusing on the urban \u2018infrastructure\u2019 \nbuilding, without focusing on capacities and linkages ignoring migration \nfrom climate-impacted rural regions is another gap amongst many in the \nclimate resilience actions. This approach requires a \u2018change\u2019: in perspective \nand in action.  That is what PARIVARTAN intervention sets to achieve \u2013 \nCHANGE that is for and led by the empowerment of the most vulnerable \ninformal worker communities.\nThe situation analysis and approach have been developed in discussion with \nexperts on climate actions and informal workers, existing secondary sources, \nIGSSS urban teams' experience and previous consultations organized by \nIGSSS. The project aims to keep inclusion, equity and diversity of informal \nworkers along with gender concerns at the core of project interventions.\n[1] In India, informal workers are those individuals who work in unorganized \nsectors and are not covered by labour laws or social security measures. This \nsegment of the workforce includes self-employed individuals, casual \nlabourers, street vendors, domestic workers, and other unorganized sector \nworkers.\n[2] The labour codes in India refer to a set of laws and regulations that \ngovern various aspects of employment, including wages, working conditions, \nsocial security, and industrial relations. In 2020, the Indian government \nintroduced four new labour codes, namely, the Code on Wages, the Industrial \nRelations Code, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions \nCode, and the Social Security Code.\n[3] https://kmda.wb.gov.in/\n[4] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/more-migrants-to-city-\nfrom-other-states-than-districts/articleshow/70354414.cms\n[5] https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/disaster-deaths-\nsinking-unprepared-kolkata-face-multiple-climate-risks-warns-ipcc-report-\n82004\n[6] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-set-to-get-own-\nclimate-action-plan-2nd-city-after-mum/articleshow/92049423.cms\n[7] https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/cop27-kolkata-\npresents-climate-action-roadmap-announces-city-level-summit-86026", "6.

Examples might include: (1) Research; (2) Provision of legal advice to...; (3) \nTraining on movement building for...\nThe Proposed Actions & Levels of Interventions\nAmongst the informal sector workers in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area \u2013 a \nspecial focus will be on Construction, Domestic Workers, Waste Pickers, \nRickshaw pullers and Street Vendors in select urban areas of KMA. As an \napproach to look at the urban-rural continuum for interventions, the \nmigrants will be treated as a special category to ensure safe\u2013informed \nmigration to the KMA through gradually evolved networks.  It is to be noted \nthat there is also a special gendered marginality within these groups, where \nwomen's participation and vulnerability are increasing. Aside from the four \npopulation groups of informal workers, \u2018future\u2019 informal workers (gig \nworkers) and climate-impacted \u2018refugee\u2019 migrants will be closely worked \nwith, special attention will be given to vulnerable-dependent groups within \nworkers like women, single women, elderly and so on.\nThe main set of actions for building resilient worker collectives is the \nfollowing:\nAt the local/micro level\n1. Building self-reliant worker collectives through monthly meetings & 8 \ncapacity building training and workshops in 4 years. The focus will be \non climate-resilient livelihood capacity building, education, and skills \ntraining. 12 localized campaigns to access basic services and \nentitlements.\n2. Access to finance and initiating collective income generation actions \nthrough 8 training courses for incubating models.\n3. Special focus on the inclusion of women workers and migrant workers.\nAt the community/ meso level\n4. 8 disaster risk reduction education and preparedness in worker \nsettlements/worksites. And 6 interface meetings will be planned to \npresent preparedness plans to representatives and government \ndepartments.\n5. Select 50 improved and resilient infrastructures in worker \nsettlements/worksites. \nAt the city/state & network / macro level\n6. 8 ULB-level and 4 state-level CSO networking meetings for \nstrengthening social/legal protection systems by workers as well as by \nthe state.\n7. 4 Policy engagement for inclusion of workers.\n8. 3 Collaboration between ULBs, government, private agencies, and civil \nsociety organizations.\n9. Developing rural\u2013urban linkages through 8 campaigns by CSO \nnetworks and worker leaders for migrant workers.\n10. 8 federation buildings of informal sector workers in KMA, West \nBengal & sharing at the National level.\nOak Application Form     13\nThe main set of actions for building resilient worker collectives is the \nfollowing:\nAt the local /micro level\n1.Building self-reliant worker collectives: Informal workers access \ntheir identification, entitlements, and basic services through \ncommunity-managed WRCs (worker resource centres) in the local and \ncollectives formalize as membership-based organizations for self-\nreliance. In year 1, community mobilization will be the focus, in years 2 \n& 3 gradually the focus will shift towards self-reliance and local-level \nresilience, in year 4 there will be a focus shift towards worker \ncollectives\u2019 sustainability and formalization of collectives.\n2.Climate-resilient livelihood capacity building and training: \nProviding training and capacity-building opportunities to informal \nworkers on climate-resilient livelihood practices and techniques can \nhelp them to better adapt to changing conditions. Year 1 actions will be \ndirected at understanding the issues of workers through a climate lens, \nmaking action plans and acting on them. At the outset, there will be \nPLA workshops organized with different workers themselves and \nthrough those exercises, the nuanced nature of impacts will be mapped \nand then the resilience practices will be developed accordingly. The \npractices will differ for each population group as their nature of work \ndiffers dramatically. Years 2 & 3 will lead to more focused capacity \nbuilding on climate resilience. Year 4 will document \u2013 formalize the \nimpacts, success, and challenges of capacity-building actions. To \naddress the gender aspects sub-group worker workshops will be \nhosted to and through facilitation will the gender issues be noted and \nan action plan developed. Years 2 & 3 will lead to more focused \ncapacity building on climate resilience. Year 4 will document \u2013 \nformalize the impacts, success, and challenges of capacity-building \nactions.\n3.Providing education and skills training: Workers, especially, \nwomen and migrant workers can benefit from education and skills \ntraining programs that can help them upgrade their skills/ upscale \nactions and find better-paying jobs. Baseline mapping and needs will \nbe assessed in year 1, and support/ training initiated for skilling. Year \n2 will focus on assessing the impacts and improving the modules. Years \n3 & 4 will scale, document, and share the impacts, successes, and \nchallenges of skilling workers.\n4.Access to finance and initiating collective income generation \nactions: Providing access to finance, including microfinance services, \ncan help informal workers in Kolkata start new businesses or diversify \ntheir income streams, making them more resilient to the impacts of \nclimate change. NULM - SHG funds are expected to be a resource for \nsuch program actions. Or programs like PMSVANIDHI that were \nintroduced by govt. post covid for street vendors. This is especially \ncritical in post-COVID times. Like other capacity-building actions, year \n1 will assess the needs and initiate income generation skilling and \ndesigning project actions, and years 2 & 3 will be about piloting them \nand documenting their impacts. Year 3 will scale, document, and share \nthe impacts, successes, and challenges of income generation modules.\nOak Application Form     14\n5.Special focus on inclusion of women workers and migrant \nworkers: As a practice and strategy, the aim will be to focus on the \nmost vulnerable workers like women workers and migrant workers for \nall actions to ensure their inclusion.\nAt the community/ meso level\n6.Disaster risk reduction education and preparedness in worker \nsettlements/worksites: Informal workers should be educated on \ndisaster risk reduction measures, including evacuation procedures, \nearly warning systems, and proper storage and handling of goods. This \nis to be executed both at informal workers' livelihood sites as well as \ntheir living settlements. Year 1 will be aimed at simplified \nunderstanding and mapping of climate impacts, disaster risks and \nthreats on maps documenting them. Year 2 will be focused on acting \non them and developing preparedness in communities and engaging \nwith authorities for executing them. Years 3 & 4 will repeat the \nprocess and refresh preparedness plans and task force teams from \ncommunities will be ready for any disasters.\n7.Improved and resilient infrastructure in worker \nsettlements/worksites: Improving the infrastructure in informal \nworker communities, such as street vendor markets and in their living \nsettlements - slums, can help to reduce their exposure to extreme \nweather events and improve their overall living/ working conditions. \nStarting from preparedness and evacuation maps in year 1, in year 2 \ncommunity-led planning for improved \u2013 resilient settlements and \nworksites will be initiated and submitted as Local Area Plans (LAPs) to \nthe authorities. In years 3 & 4, the exercise will be undertaken further \nto improve the condition of the settlement to a model settlement that \ncan be upscaled later. With the last year to focus on documentation \nand scaling of resilience-building practices. \nAt the city/state & network / macro level\n8.Strengthening social/legal protection systems by workers as well \nas by the state: The worker collectives to self-help and support their \nmembers. And Governments and a network of civil society \norganizations should work to strengthen social protection systems for \ninformal workers in Kolkata, such as providing access to health \ninsurance, legal assistance, and food assistance during times of crisis. \nIn Year 1,2 along with CSO support worker communities will be \nsupported for social\u2013legal assistance. Year 3 practices and methods \nwill be documented during implementation. Year 4 impacts will be \nassessed, practices improved and actions scaled.  \n9.Policy engagement for inclusion of workers: Policy engagement \nefforts can help to address the systemic issues that contribute to the \nvulnerability of informal workers in Kolkata, including promoting \ndecent working conditions and strengthening labour laws. Policy briefs \nwill be prepared in all the years and submitted to relevant authorities \nfor policy progression.\n10.Collaboration between ULBs, government, private \nagencies, and civil society organizations: Collaboration between \nULBs, government agencies, private agencies and civil society \nOak Application Form     15\norganizations can help to ensure that the needs and concerns of \ninformal workers are addressed in the development and \nimplementation of climate resilience measures. Pilot programs and \ndemonstrations are to be executed through formal collaborations with \nthe government where possible. Year 1 will focus mostly on sharing \npractices and experiences. Year 2 will work on the implementation of \ncollaborative actions and Years 3 & 4 will focus on the formalization of \nactions and collaborations.\n11.Developing rural\u2013urban linkages through CSO networks \nand worker leaders for migrant workers: Building community \nsupport networks: Migrant workers can benefit from community \nsupport networks that provide them with emotional and practical \nsupport. These networks can also help them access resources and \nservices that they might not otherwise be able to access. Year 1 will \nfocus mostly on sharing practices and experiences. Years 2 & 3 on \npiloting engagements and exchanges with networks, and communities. \nYear 4 will document, upscale and formalize the interventions, vis-\u00e0-vis \nmigrants.\n12.Federation building of informal sector workers in KMA, \nWest Bengal & sharing at the National level: The worker \ncollectives, CSOs and networks will work together to mainstream \ninformal workers' concerns in emerging issues of urban development \nand climate resilience building. There will be a workers federation \nemerging in KMA, and through networking at the state level and \nnational levels, the worker's issues will be mainstreamed with climate \nresilience actions. As per the collective\u2019s strength, guidance and \nsupport will be offered from year 1 onwards. With a special focus to \nscale efforts in year 2 and on building formal institutions in years 3 and \n4.\nStrategies for the Interventions\n1.Vision for Sustainable Cities & Resilience Building as the \noverarching framework for Interventions for IGSSS: The changed \ncontext of Indian cities is the key reason for the proposition of an \noverarching framework of sustainable cities that addresses not only \nthe issue of inclusivity but equity along with the issues of \nsustainability, resilience, urban governance and participation in the \ncity making process. The vision for sustainable cities developed in 2020 \nstill holds good and needs to be furthered with the resilience building \nof informal worker communities. IGSSS has since 2020 moved beyond \nsustainability, but also is in the process of developing a holistic \norganizational process for resilience building. The ongoing churning \nalso forms the basis for the interventions proposed in the proposed \nintervention.\n2.Demystifying climate resilience for enabling localized actions: \nTo enable localized actions, it is important to demystify climate \nresilience by breaking it down into more manageable components. It \nwill be expected that IGSSS collaborates and partner with technical \nagencies with \u2018expertise\u2019 in climate action, but the project will strive to \ndevelop community \u2018expertise\u2019 in addressing the resilience needs.  By \ntaking steps to demystify climate resilience for informal workers, \nOak Application Form     16\nlocalized actions can be taken to support these workers in adapting to \nand building resilience against the impacts of climate change. This can \nhelp ensure that the most vulnerable members of society are not left \nbehind in the face of this global challenge.\n3.Planned interventions in all levels and scales \u2013 The proposed \ninterventions are imagined to be at the level of local/ micro level, \ncommunity/ meso level, city, state, and national/ macro level. The \nlocal/micro will focus mostly on informal worker collectives and their \nneeds in the local like capacities, training, access to identity, \nentitlements and so on. At the community level/ meso level, the focus is \nmore on developing resilience at their working and living sites and will \ninvolve engagements with the wider community. At the city, state, and \nnational/macro levels, the focus will be on policy change and network \nbuilding. This differential level intervention has worked well in the \nprevious IGSSS actions and suits well for an informal worker climate \nresilience project, and we hope to improve the same in the coming \ninterventions.\n4.Gradual/strategic development of project actions led by worker \ncollectives starting from micro to macro:  Since the focus of the \nproject is community mobilization leading to resilience building, the \nfocus initially (year 1) will be on building capacities of the collectives, \nstarting with initial low hanging fruits like entitlements and identity \ndocuments, then going on to engage on meso level issues of developing \nthe worker settlements, then with support from CSO network groups \ncould influence and reach out to government and private players\u2019 \naccountability. As we move towards year 2 and year 3, the focus will \nshift from collectivization to collective action on objective2 (community \nlevel) and 3 (city/state federations). Objective 1 actions will be led by \nworker leaders themselves in the long run and are imagined to be \nsustainable in a span of two project cycles.\n5.People (worker) led development in the micro, meso, and IGSSS-\nled action in the macro level: The worker and community collectives \nin the local are expected to take complete ownership of the actions at \nthe local and community level. Training and mobilization of worker \ncollectives will be the prerogative of IGSSS local staff. The state staff \nwill focus on networking// federation at the city/ state level for \ncollaborative actions. The IGSSS Thematic will steer networking at a \nnational level and contribute to the policy discourse on climate change, \ninformal workers and urbanization in India and Global South from a \nresilience lens.\n6.Developing people\u2019s institutions and organizations: The proposed \nprogram envisages that community collectives/ people\u2019s organizations \ndo not just remain as community-based initiatives in the project period \nbut sustain and continue to work as bulwarks of local democracy and \nurban resilience for worker communities. This will be attempted \nthrough a host of capacity building and handholding of the worker \ncollectives. Alongside this, the key strategy will be to work at their \npersonal level on life skills, building resilience and developing a \nmechanism for reporting violations and abuses to key points for \naddress and preservation of dignity in their lives, also by supporting \nOak Application Form     17\nthe community collectives to adopt sustainable and resilience building \ninitiatives in their local and community level.\n7.Building networks and sustaining established ones \u2013 The terrain \nfrom the national level policy engagement has shifted to the state and \nULB levels. It is in this context that the premise of community \nfederations into a larger critical mass is foundational to having larger-\nlevel policy engagement. Community collectives, extremely successful \nlocals, need spaces and opportunities to collaborate and learn from \neach other to raise bigger demands for more inclusive city spaces and \nparticipatory decision-making. This underlying theme forms the other \nfundamental assumption in the project design. Consequently, such \nspaces for forming city-level and state-level federations are provided \nfor in the project intervention that will go a long way in engaging with \nthe state and mainstreaming the informal workers and climate justice \ndiscourse in policy circles. It is also expected that these networks that \ndevelop will be composed of middle-class groups, and private agencies/ \nbodies as well, with a common consensus developed with the informal \nworkers to demand climate resilience and sustainable cities for all.\n8.Policy engagement, as well as collaboration with the different \nlevels of the government \u2013 Engagement and working with the state, \nis put forth as the only way to better the development of communities \nand cities. Especially for informal workers in the context of climate \nresilience building. The reason why the different levels of state and \nbureaucracy fail to function as expected is because of the lack of \nengagement, access and proximity to the urban poor issues, it is this \ngap that the project wishes to address between the communities and \nthe state, through multifarious engagements from the local community \ndevelopment plans to the state - national policy level discussions. The \nstate, especially the ULBs are looking for collaborative opportunities \nwith organizations for climate action and that space needs to be \nutilized. Existing Oak Foundation partners with networks will also aid \nin the process of building collaborations, especially with the private \nsector.\n9.Thematic Hub of Urban Poverty Reduction contributes to \nnational-level policy discourse: The last phase has initiated the \ndevelopment of the Urban Poverty Thematic Hub in IGSSS, it is in now \na steering position to direct the national discourse on sustainable \nurbanization, wrt to informal workers and their inclusion in urban \nresilience \u2013 climate actions. With a good number of partners and \nnetworks, it is expected that a strong national network will emerge to \nkeep a close watch on policy development and aid in developing the \nunderstanding of urban poor and climatic justice discourse with the \nCSOs and wider public nationally, and internationally.\n10.Research and documentation will be integral to the project \nand would strengthen the engagement initiatives. The city and \nstate-level situations/ datasets of the target groups will be consolidated \nat the national level for effective engagement. The information from \ncities and states shall also help in building/contributing to campaigns, \ncollaborations, and policy engagement at the state/national level.\nStaff structure\nOak Application Form     18\nThe staff structure is to suit the implementation reality. There will be more \nfocus on rooting the interventions with the community mobilisers, who will \nbe leading the interventions in the communities mostly under micro-level \nactions. The community mobilisers will be supported by a community \ncoordinator who capacitates communities for meso actions and supports \nnetworking at the city/state level. The capacity building and training \nofficer will be entrusted with training communities, and leaders through \nIGSSS city & local staff and developing and executing the training modules. \nThe project coordinator will be the executing in charge of the project. The \nthematic leads on urban and climate change will lead the overall \nenvisioning and coordination of key actions in the project.

Both the project implementation and financial accounting are \ninvestigated at the time of the monitoring visit by the teams. PME unit and \nProgramme Management teams also visit the field and provide support to \nensure that implementation/operations are on track. Half-yearly review \nmeeting with teams is also conducted regionally for result tracking and cross-\nlearning.\nManagement Information System (MIS)\nThe project level MIS begins with - 1. Analysis and benchmarking of a baseline \nstudy of any project before its inception at the project level. Thereafter 2. \nrefinement of the project indicators based on RBM and IGSSS strategic plans \nmay be carried out. In discussions with funding partners and organizations. 3. \nSetting up performance tracking tables at the project level with targets and \nbaseline figures to be finalized. 4. Setting project-level tools for recording \nresults. We use e-tools like the Kobo collects app to collect and record data at \nthe field level. Then, 5. periodic data collection and compilation are executed. \nUsually, this is in sync with the reporting cycles and data is assessed every \nquarter. Afterwhich 6. Analysis of data generated and reporting is shared with \nfunding partners and within IGSSS as well.  At the organizational level, where \nproject level MIS feeds into. The monitoring and evaluation unit of IGSSS helps \nthe project level actions with 1. setting up of indicators based on IGSSS \nstrategic plan and objectives. 2. pooling out the information from individual \nprojects. 3. periodic data collection and compilation and 4. aid the respective \nthematic team with reporting as well. \nInternal Reporting:\nWithin IGSSS, reporting is on a project-to-project basis. IGSSS state units \nsubmit their progress reports to the thematic leads. The state coordinators \nverify the reports and forward them to the thematic with their \nrecommendations and observations. This is vetted and supported by the Urban \nPoverty Reduction Team. Regular program-related and financial feedback is \nprovided by the grants team, based in Delhi. Technical inputs are also provided \non MIS by the M&E working under the grants team. Thematic and financial \nmanagement support is actively provided to each state to smoothen \ncoordination processes. The yearly audit is carried out on the completion of \nthe Grant period. \nThe state teams prepare timely reports, based on the work done in \ncommunities, taking stock of the activities that have been undertaken during \nthat time. The quarterly activity updates and six-monthly reports are submitted \nto the respective thematic offices of IGSSS. The thematic offices submit a six-\nOak Application Form     23\nmonthly report to the Programme Management & Grants team based at IGSSS \nDelhi. The team reviews the report and verifies the information from other \nsources and reporting tools. Appropriate feedback is provided to the state \noffices, where course correction or supportive inputs are required. The urban \nthematic unit drafts the report, which is then finalized and shared with funding \npartners.", "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGES\nWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your \noutcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?\nWe understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we \nexpect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be \nopen to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your \noutcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? \n(300 words):\nRisks, Outlook, Prospects and Sustainability of Actions\nThere is an increasing amount of distrust of the authorities towards NGOs and \nthe changed legal rules that discourage networking is one such perfect \nexample. Going forward in the coming years it will be increasingly tough to \nwork on policy engagement and recommendations, it is better to adopt a more \n\u2013 model-based approach. There are also similar locational issues that are \nbound to impact the interventions. The project proposal rests on the premise \nthat climate-resilient model building and scaling with collaborations with state \nand non-state actors is the best way forward. And will address the mistrust \nwith some of the authorities. The pandemic has resulted in the state and \nadministration retracting a lot \u2013 with respect to the budgets and attention to \nthe urban poor and worker needs. It is expected that the welfare state and \npolicy provisions are bound to shrink in the coming years. Thereby recognizing \nthat policy-level engagements become further complicated. The silver lining \nthough is that the concept of climate resilience for informal workers may be \nthe most suited to this urban poverty team and its interventions for informal \nworkers at this stage of the intervention. As the issue is of prime importance \nto the state and authorities and will be more receptive to ideas and suggestions \nfor improving the same.\nOperational challenges: technical financial and partner-related risks.\n\u2022The change in the laws related to Foreign Contribution \nRegulation in India: The NGOs cannot use 20% of funds in \nadministrative expenses, thereby putting further restrictions in the \nmanner where collaborative and joint interventions will now be \nrestricted or must be strategically reduced to adhere to the guidelines. \nThese factors have been accounted for in the project design.\n\u2022The program design is based on network building and its \nchallenges:  Due to the changed law, the project intervention has been \nOak Application Form     24\nnow conceived wholly to be directly implemented by IGSSS. The \nerstwhile partners and networks of IGSSS in the form of CSOs, CBOs \nand networks will remain as joint actors for engagement and campaigns, \nand specific support will be extended to local CSOs who will be engaged \nwith and if needed capacitated to address the issues of climate \nresilience. Thereby imagining partnerships from the earlier formal \nproject-based collaborations to more organic issue-based non-financial \ncollaborations to allow for the transfer of knowledge and domain \nknowledge of emerging challenges of urban through networking at \nlevels and scales.  \n\u2022Stressing innovative approaches and income generation for \nCOVID realities: post \u2013 COVID economic slowdown and lack of \nlivelihoods are going to be a reality for the next five years. To kick-start \nthe interventions and to ensure the project aims for sustainable \npractices innovative models have been dovetailed into the proposals. \nLike \u2013 Worker resource centres, will ensure more accessible locations \nfor communities to get access to and resolve their livelihoods concerns. \nThese centres will be run by trained community volunteers. To \npropagate climate resilience for informal workers practice models will \nbe identified, documented, and scaled with support, and shared for \nwider implementation across CSO networks. Also, the COVID-19 \npandemic has brought a livelihood crisis that will be only ameliorated \nwith income generation and community institution/ membership models \nthat this intervention aims to support and nurture for the long term. \nThe following actions/ strategies are thought to ensure the viability of \nthe project: \n\u2022People-led actions and change: The principle of a rights-based \napproach is at the core of all programming under the proposed initiative, \nwhere the focus is on capacitating the workers belonging to the \nmarginalised sections of the urban to access their rights to identity, \nentitlements, and habitats and livelihoods. The focus on creating a \ncapacitated community leadership and cadre to lead the interventions \nwill also go a long way to ensure that the community efforts remain \nsustainable. Institution/ capacity building of worker collectives and \nstructures to ensure that the community owns and invests in all \ndevelopment actions planned and implemented in their contexts. This \nwould include worker collectives, CBOs, Self Help Groups, and City level \nfederations that are formalized and transformed to people\u2019s \norganizations and institutions. The networks and alliances created at the \nlocal, state, and national levels with diverse stakeholders and actors will \nlead to capacitated CSOs working on informal workers and climate \nresilience. Thereby far outliving the project duration. This will also \npopularize the informal workers and their climate resilience discourse \namongst the many networks and in the development sector in India.   \n\u2022Convergence and collaborations with state and non-state actors: \nConvergence and collaboration with resources and entitlements from \nthe government have been a central strategy underpinning the work \nwith communities. This will be promoted in this project as well \u2013 through \nlinkages with the already listed policy engagements, implementation of \nexisting laws and acts, as well as with the line departments and ULBs of \nthe urban areas. Expenses will be made on the least cost basis without \nOak Application Form     25\ncompromising quality. Low-cost meetings, workshops, exposures, \nconventions, etc. will be arranged so that these can be continued even \nafter the project period with minimal external financial support. \n\u2022Low-cost and climate-conscious project actions: Exploring new \nways of working together with minimal resources \u2013 for example, \ncollaborations with alliances and networks, sharing of knowledge/know-\nhow with like-minded institutions, and building up a strong case for \nevidential engagement through joint research and action. The activated \ncommunities and networks will be hoped to continue the development \nwork that they learned during the project time. Any support offered in \nthe name of model building and initial grounding of climate resilience \nmodels and income generational activities will be left with the \ncommunity itself. At an organizational level, it is further decided that all \nmeetings and gatherings hosted by IGSSS will avoid the use of plastic. \nAnd travels between cities will be promoted through rail only. Only in \ncase of large distances will air/flight will be considered.\n\u2022Phasing of project interventions: IGSSS has imagined and designed \nthis phase of work with informal workers and climate resilience for the \n2023-26 phase. IGSSS's understanding of informal workers, and \nsustainable cities have further improved in the last five years, and we \nhope to continue with our sustainable \u2013 resilient cities framework that \nthe urban team has devised for interventions. The proposed phase will \nhave its evaluations carried out and the strategy for further actions and \ninterventions will be decided in consultation with stakeholders and \nactors. It is expected that the program will be continued in at least one \nmore phase of interventions in the same area with the constituent \ngroups", "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11.  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS\nPlease use this space to respond to any specific questions from your Oak \nprogramme officer. If none were received, please leave this section blank. \nFirst Set of Questions responded on 17.02.2023\n\u2022The request is heavy on reaching out and collectivizing the workers and \ntheir families for claiming entitlements and services and less so on \ngovernment and private players\u2019 accountability towards them beyond \nensuring the entitlements\nComment taken and accepted; this could be tweaked in the proposal if \nrequired. But most of the focus initially (year 1) will be at building capacities \nof the collectives, starting with initial low-hanging fruits like entitlements, \nthen developing the worker settlements (which is very tough), then with \nsupport from CSO network groups could influence and reach out to \ngovernment and private players\u2019 accountability in year 2. As we move \ntowards year 3 and year 4, the focus will shift from collectivization to \nOak Application Form     26\ncollective action on objective2 (community level) and 3 (city/state \nfederations). Objective 1 actions will be led by the worker leaders \nthemselves.\nGovernment will be easier, but private players will be a challenge. As shared \nby you earlier as well, we can reach out / collaborate with jan sahas or other \noak foundation partners who are working with private players, that will make \nthe engagements easy to begin with. Please share any other suggestion that \nyou might have.\n\u2022Is there a plan to collaborate with technical organisations on issues like \nmitigating impact on migrant  workers from heat stress, air and noise \npollution ? in other words, build their resilience to the changing climate \n?\nYes, we have made sufficient progress on climate actions since 2020, when \nwe brought in the climate action as part of urban interventions. Rural \ninterventions have long had climate resilience building programs. In urban, \nwe are working with workers in behavioural aspects, as well as to secure \ntheir livelihoods and settlements. And are collaborating with numerous \nexperts and organizations on the same. Like CANSA, TERI, INECC and so on. \nBut we are also clear that it is only worker/ community collectives plus the \ntechnical support partners, who can combine think of innovative ways of \naddressing climate action for workers. As sometimes, it is easy to get stuck in \nthe technicalities and workers lose the connection with the climate impact \nissue, and solutions are not accessible, easy to scale and replicate. Lately, we \nhave pushed climate action for informal workers in our national networking \nmeeting and have just initiated small studies to assess the loss and damage; \nand propose/ frame actions/ policies for different workers. I will keep you in \nloop and posted of the same. Also, we with support frm hawker federation \nleaders are engaged in policy engagement and advocacy, and recently met \nILO and NitiAyog to push climate impact agenda of informal worker into \npolicy action.  Which they have agreed to incorporate.\n\u2022To what extent will the design be drawn based on inputs from primary \ncommunities?\nOh, very much. I think I answered this question above. It has to be based and \nled by primary / impacted communities. Or else climate action of mitigation, \nadaptation and resilience will not succeed. Mitigation might, but other two \nwill not. This is our experience of working on climate change in urban since \n2020.\n\u2022What is the expected cost of the project? do you have any committed \n/potential funding? what is the amount expected from Oak?\nWe have not calculated the expected project costs in detail but are looking at \ntentatively around 4 Cr for a 4-year intervention. We can think about raising \nlocal resources from other donors and existing programs / projects but will \nbe an expecting or seeking Oak to fund majority costs of the same. Will be \nbetter to discuss this and the scale of the program as well before arriving at \na figure.\n\u2022Explain what is IGSSS\u2019s experience on this broad topic? How will you \nprovide key advisory to government bodies to reduce climate impact on \nworkers who have to be in the open to carry out their work \u2013 like work \nOak Application Form     27\nwith the pollution control board and department of health? Who do you \nsee as the key ecosystem players?\nIGSSS is having extensive experience of over 12 years of urban poverty \ninterventions in urban. And increasingly, since 2020 we have through climate \nvulnerabilities and impact lens started to mainstream climate action with \ncommunities leading the change. We are having internal organizational \nexperience of working with rural climate change actions for over many \ndecades and that is helping us immensely in the existing/proposed work. We \nalso have a climate change thematic, that closely works with urban thematic \nto address urban poor / worker climate change issues. We can prepare a note \non the measures taken by urban team on climate change actions. IGSSS is \nalso working with governments across scales to push climate action and \nresilience building.\nFor impacting policies, the first step will be document the impact, calculate \nthe losses, place the requirements \u2013 demands from the community into \npolicies and laws for informal workers so to address the damages caused by \nclimate change. We are at this stage of the development and with urban poor \ncommunities we have carried out strong \u2013 successful pilots in 13 cities. With \ninformal workers taking examples from 8 cities, we are undertaking studies \nand engaging with policy makers to reframe climate policies wrt to urban \npoor and workers. The second step shall be to engage with the respective \nplayers, the welfare boards, the ULBs, the climate change ministry and other \npolicy think tanks of the state. Thereafter the next step will be to take it to \nthe implementation departments like PCB, health, and so on. The second and \nthird step we wish to undertake in this year.\n\u2022Please share some documents about IGSSS\u2019s organogram and board in \nIndia. Last information on the FCRA status of IGSSS will be useful.\nLast information on FCRA status is that it is awarded till March 2023. We \nhave not had any queries and the process was smooth. We are hopeful to \nhave the same approved very soon. Organogram and board details I will be \nsharing in the mail.\n \n \nSecond Set of Questions responded on 28.03.2023\nQuestions from the Director \u2013 India Programme and the President:\n\u2022References where IGSSS's work has been recognized by the policy and\nSome of the policy impacts are as follows:\n\u2022IGSSS contribution to NULM-SUH in 2011- 2012  \n\u2022IGSSS model shelters for women/ livelihood program for homeless in \nDelhi 2011-15\n\u2022Notification of holistic response for homeless during COVID outbreak \nMoHUA - 2020\n\u2022Notification for vaccination for homeless MoHUA \u2013 2020\n\u2022Notification of world homeless day in AP, MH, DL \u2013 2018 - 2022\n\u2022Notification for winter response and shelters for urban homeless by \nMoHUA \u2013 2021\nOak Application Form     28\n\u2022Rules for transgender welfare board in Madhya Pradesh by Social Justice \ndepartment - 2022\n\u2022Simplification of guidelines / operational manual for working with \ncommunities during COVID outbreak & contribution to NDMA NGO \ncoordination group \u2013 2020 \u2013 21\n\u2022National draft policy and acceptance by BMC for city level policy \u2013 2021 \n- 22\n\u2022Allocation by BMC for homeless shelters in Mumbai Development Plan \n2014-34 & Allocations in BMC budget \u2013 2015 & onwards\n\u2022First set of byelaws for street vendors presented to AMC \u2013 2022\n\u2022Policy improvement for slums on railway land \u2013 Surat Slum dwellers \nright to housing recognized. \u2013 2022\n\u2022IGSSS part of select organization to assist MoHUA in transformation of \nNULM 2.0 especially for NULM-SUH \u2013 2023\nIf you wish, we can prepare a set of annexures on the policy impacts that we \nhave had in as urban team. The annexures could be in the form of publications, \ncorrespondences, and orders.\n\u2022In the proposed request, what are the different levels in the government \nthat IGSSS plans to engage ?\nIn the proposed project, it is expected that the closest engagement will be with \nthe ULBs, and state government. Through the other existing project action and \nthe CSO networking in the proposed there will be engagements with the \ncentral level ministries and agencies. The most focus will be with ULBs and \nstate government, ministries and departments.\n\u2022What is the expected timeline of support from Oak beyond the four years' \nof this request ? what kind of sustainable funding sources does \nIGSSS have that may be invested in this programme?\nThe request is for 4 years for this project. We are heavily invested in informal \nworkers and urban poor communities and are hoping to continue our key \nflagship projects of satat shehar & punarnirman for urban poor and informal \nworkers in the coming years. And as a development agency, we have \ncommitted to our long-term engagement with urban poor and worker \ncommunities as constituency. It is also requested that at least one more cycle \nof project funding be supported, if possible, by oak with the same constituency \nto ensure the sustainability of actions and wider impacts.\n\u2022Given the similarity in challenges faced  by informal sector workers in \nother growing economies such as India, it will be useful to know whether \nIGSSS will draw examples on  how government and not-for -profits in \nthose countries are dealing with such challenges.\nYes, it is something that we are already are embarking upon. Especially \nexchange with global south countries/ cities and as well as more closely with \nsouth Asian / south east Asian partners. As many countries and cities are \nleading the discourse on climate resilience and we will benefit from working \nwith them. Like Bangladesh for example. We have already established \nconnections with networks there and hope it will help initiating a good \nexchange of thoughts, policies, experiences and practice.\nOak Application Form     29\n\u2022Is there any engagement planned with the National Disaster \nManagement Authority which is yet to fully apply climate-lens in dealing \nwith disasters?\nYes, it is planned and included in the scope to broaden the understanding of \nworking on the issue of urban disasters that are ignored as of now. Especially \nthe climate change related ones that are impacting informal workers and \nurban poor communities. Also, we were part of the NGO coordination group \nset by NDMA during COVID and contributed to the discussions then. \nTherefore, hopeful about converting some ideas/ interventions into policies.\n\u2022Given the large number of small and medium-sized entities that employ \ninformal workers, they may find it difficult to adapt the action plans that \nmay require capital investments \u2013  would you address this \ndirectly/indirectly?\nYes, I think there is an increased state support required for recognition of \naction plans, only through that eventually will entities and/or communities be \nable to address the challenges faced by them. This intervention proposed by \nIGSSS is not based on capital investment, but to facilitate that through \ncollectivization and convergence.  But this project may wish to show models/ \npilots that might need small supports to communities to facilitate the \ncreation of examples that can be upscaled by the state.", "12. DECLARATIONS": "12.

Our work is rooted in a theory of change built around the \npower of social movements to leverage systemic changes. It posits that \nmovements based in the grassroots are necessary for social and \nenvironmental change because: 1) they represent local agendas and are \ncomprised of the people with the greatest knowledge, experience, and \nstake in protecting their environment; 2) they have greater moral \nauthority to question and change systems that adversely affect them; and \n3) they serve as the roots from which larger movements for social change \ngain the motivation and inspiration to grow.\nGlobal Greengrants Fund was established in 1992, and over nearly three \ndecades has built a decentralised and participatory decision-making \nmodel, in which a network of 200 volunteer activist advisors sets our \nstrategies and makes grant recommendations, in addition to \naccompanying grassroots partners in their work through mentoring and \nother non-financial support. These advisors, organised in 25 advisory \nboards, sister funds and strategic partner organisations, are responsible \nfor identifying grassroots actors who are working to change the systemic \ncauses of climate change, environmental destruction and social and \neconomic injustice; and to strengthen these actors through flexible, \nresponsive and strategic funding and accompaniment. This advisory \nnetwork collectively represents our most powerful asset.\nSince 1992, Global Greengrants Fund has supported over 15,000 \ngrassroots initiatives around the world, almost 1,000 of them since 2013 \nthrough Global Greengrants Fund UK, the younger, independent sister \ncharity and applicant.

(300 words)\nGlobal Greengrants Fund was established in 1993 to channel direct funding \nand support to grassroots civil society actors working for environmental and \nsocial justice across the world. We do this through a decentralised, \nparticipatory grant-making model in which our network of over 200 expert \nlocal advisors identify grassroots movements; channel small, flexible grants \nfunding to them; and provide ongoing mentorship and accompaniment to \nthem as they deliver their self-determined initiatives. In 2013, Global \nGreengrants Fund UK was registered as an independent charity in England \n& Wales, with the first staff member joining the organisation in 2016.\nThe global organisation has grown significantly in recent years, and \ncurrently funds over 1,000 initiatives per year (including 217 through the UK \nentity in 2020-21). The UK organisation has grown its revenue and staffing \nresources substantially, and is on track to exceed $5m income for the \ncurrent fiscal year.\nGlobal Greengrants Fund\u2019s India Advisory Board was established in 2001 to \nsupport grassroots environmental protection and rights-based development \nwork through small grants and advisor mentorship. The Board\u2019s work covers \na diverse set of issues, from forest rights to water and sanitation, but with a \ncross-cutting focus on the most marginalised groups, including Adivasi and \nDalit communities; women; transgender people; and rural and remote \npopulations. The Oak Foundation has been the Board\u2019s longest-term and \nlargest donor since its inception, supporting the Board since 2012. This \nsupport from the Foundation has been critical to the Board\u2019s evolving \nstrategy: as one of the Board\u2019s only funders providing multi-year support, the \nOak Foundation has enabled the Board to develop relationships, networks \nand more in-depth understanding of the specific challenges facing the group \nit supports.\nWhile the growth of our support to grassroots movements is a major \nachievement of the past two years, the achievement we are most proud of is \nour advisory networks\u2019 ability to continue strengthening grassroots \nmovements within the extraordinarily challenging context of Covid-19; in \nIndia, with the support of the Oak Foundation, the Advisory Board was able \nto rapidly mobilise emergency grants to 11 local initiatives on the frontline of \nCovid response during the country\u2019s deadly second wave, and continues to \nprovide additional support to all its grantees affected by the pandemic as \nrequired.\nOak Application Form     7\n5c.

(600 words):\nContext\nOver twenty years on since the inception of the Global Greengrants Fund \nIndia Advisory Board, marginalised communities in India continue to face a \ncomplex, interconnected range of social, environmental, health and rights \nchallenges, all of which have been exacerbated significantly by the \nimmediate and longer-term impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and of the \nclimate crisis.\nRural women and marginalised communities, including Adivasis, Dalits and \nmigrant workers, have been disproportionately affected by the immediate \nhealth risk from the virus and by the effects of lockdown measures, including \nloss of income, food insecurity and exposure to violence; an estimated 75 \nmillion people in India were pushed into poverty during the first wave of the \npandemic alone. The effects of the pandemic have been especially \npronounced for the Adivasi communities supported by our Advisory Board; \nmany of the casual labourers who returned to remote rural communities at \nthe beginning of the pandemic have remained there, putting additional \npressure on already highly stretched local resources. Logging, mining and \nother activities harmful to the environment \u2013 both officially sanctioned and \nillegal \u2013 have increased, representing a major challenge to communities \nreliant on natural resources for their livelihoods, food, shelter and medicine, \ndespite the protections set out in the Forest Rights Act.\nSimultaneously, climate-linked disasters such as Cyclone Tauktae in 2021, \nflooding and landslides across multiple states particularly including the \nnorth-east, and the major heatwave of spring 2022, are destroying the \nlivelihoods of thousands of farming and fishing communities already facing \nextreme poverty and food insecurity as a result of the pandemic. As well as \nthe immediate threat to lives and property from disasters of this kind, \nclimate change is driving increased water scarcity, crop failure, soil erosion \nand the loss of biodiversity including fishing stocks.\nBoth before the pandemic and during it, local organisations and movements \nacross India have been the frontline responders to the intersecting health, \nsocial and environmental crises they face: identifying local challenges, \ndesigning solutions and mobilizing communities to carry them out. Through \nits grant-making and accompaniment work with emerging civil society \nactors, the India Advisory Board aims to strengthen these locally-led \ninitiatives, enabling them to become more effective in achieving their self-\ndetermined goals while also promoting a rights-based, inclusive approach to \nsocial and environmental justice work that is rooted in local agency, \nautonomy and dignity.\nThis grant-making and accompaniment work is also how we have identified \nthe specific challenges affecting marginalised groups in India: with the \nsupport of the Oak Foundation, our advisors have developed an analysis \nwhich is rooted in the perspectives and experiences of our grantee partners. \nOak Application Form     8\nThe proposed work is informed by this analysis and by Global Greengrants\u2019 \noverarching theory of change, which posits that movements based in the \ngrassroots are necessary for social and environmental change because they \nrepresent local agendas and are comprised of the people with the greatest \nknowledge, experience, and stake in protecting their environment; because \nthey have greater moral authority to question and change systems that \nadversely affect them; and because they serve as the roots from which larger \nmovements for social change gain the motivation and inspiration to grow.\nOur partnership with Oak Foundation and recent highlights\nAs mentioned above, the Oak Foundation has been supporting Global \nGreengrants Fund\u2019s India Advisory Board since 2012, with over 200 \ngrassroots initiatives funded and accompanied by our advisors in total \nthrough this partnership.\nIn the most recent phase of our partnership \u2013 the 2018-22 grant to which this \nproposed work links directly \u2013 we set out the following objectives:\n1) To support a total of 40-50 grassroots civil society initiatives in Jharkhand \nand West Bengal with small grants to enable action on environmental justice \nand climate change, aiming to strengthen their ability to effectively advocate \nfor their rights and implement viable solutions to local challenges; and in the \nmedium to long term, to strengthen their organisational capacity.\n2) To foster stronger networks among local civil society organizations in \nJharkhand and West Bengal, as well as across India, through a series of \ngrantee workshops and through grant-making to network organisations, with \nthe aim of grantees having increased resources including knowledge, skills \nand financial support to carry out their work.\n3) To promote women\u2019s rights, safety, well-being, and economic security \nthrough small grants to women-led and women-focused environmental \njustice activities (30% of all grant-making), as well as through advisors \nworking with grantees to support the incorporation of a gender lens in their \nwork, with the aim of securing an increased leadership role for women in \nenvironmental justice initiatives. Examples of the types of activity supported \nthrough this objective include women-led initiatives addressing forest rights \nand agriculture.\nDuring this most recent phase, 55 grassroots initiatives were supported with \nsmall grants to implement solutions for environmental justice and in \nresponse to climate change. The majority of projects focused on raising \nawareness of the importance of natural resource conservation, especially for \nwomen and youth, and orienting the communities towards organic and \nsustainable agriculture to improve livelihood opportunities, food security, \nand health. Projects also focused on strengthening grassroots institutions \nand local governance, supporting minority groups in obtaining and \nimplementing Community Forest Rights in the context of FRA2006, \nempowering Gram Sabha, and providing equal access to water and \nsanitation.\nKey learnings from this most recent phase of work include:\n\u2022Thirty-one percent of grantees who have reported have been able to \naccess additional funding as a result of the grant provided through the \nOak Foundation support. This includes funding from international \nfoundations such as Keystone Foundation, Foundation for Ecological \nOak Application Form     9\nSecurity, 350.org, Action Aid and AJWS, but also national government \nadministration (e.g. Forest Department of Jhrakhand, NABARD \n(National Agriculture Bank And Rural Development), Krishi Vigyan \nKendra (Agriculture Research Centre), and other national NGOs and \ninternational NGOs including MOCICC (Movimiento Ciudadano frente \na Cambio Clim\u00e1tico, a Peruvian NGO). In addition, forty-two percent of \ngrantees have told us that thanks to GGF\u2019s support, they have been \nable to benefit from new networking opportunities, increased \nrecognition and trust from the wider community, and general support. \nIn some cases, it was observed that the visibility gained is a gateway to \nadditional funding opportunities.\n\u2022Overall, groups observed a general inclination toward learning from - \nand helping - each other; forums and district-level meetings were \norganised to exchange lessons learned, experiences, and best practice. \nSome organisations have started to hold interactions with district-level \nNGOs, have been given opportunities to take part in stronger networks \nwith other grassroots groups, and have been invited to join \ninternational conferences.\n\u2022Several of the grants made also went to network organisations; for \nexample, one network organisation based in Karnakata is organising a \nseries of twelve national and regional level meetings to develop and \npresent an action plan regarding forest rights to policymakers. Access \nto these types of networks is critical for many of the grassroots \norganisations we support, who are often unable to access other \nsources of information and advice, and are able to share resources and \nstrategies as a result.\n\u202257% of grants made have been to women-led organisations or to \ninitiatives focused on women\u2019s rights, wellbeing, and economic \nsecurity. Women are more prominently represented in the leadership \nof their organisation and have been able to develop their leadership \nskills through the seminars or workshops offered by the projects. In \nsome projects, women's participation grew so much that they now \nrepresent one-third of the forest rights committee at the Gram Sabha \nlevel, where they often assume prestigious roles (secretariat, \npresidency, vice-presidency). In some cases, women are taking a \ncrucial role in decision-making and lead the negotiations with local \nauthorities.\n\u2022Eighty percent of the grantees who have reported have said that \nthanks to the Oak Foundation\u2019s support they have been able to improve \nenvironmental conditions at the local level. Organisations could \nmeasure an overall increase in the awareness and responsibility of \nlocal communities towards improving environmental conditions and \nsafeguarding natural resources, for example, through the set-up of \nForest Rights Committees, Village Forest Management Committees, or \nthrough campaigning. Benefits reported by the grantees include: \nincreased wildlife protection; restoration of water channels; farmers \nshifting to organic agriculture/ agroecology and no longer using \nchemical fertilisers and pesticides; regeneration of wastelands, and the \nreturn of birds, animals, and plant species.\nThemes in our grant-making to date, and emerging priorities\nOak Application Form     10\nWhile the Board\u2019s strategy focuses on the most marginalised groups, a \nnumber of cross-cutting themes have emerged across its work with these \ngroups across the different geographies within India where it works. The \nproposed work aims to leverage the Board\u2019s existing networks and expertise, \nand with the support of the Foundation to also develop new approaches, \nresources and capacity which can make it more effective in addressing these \nspecific themes and challenges. These themes include:\n\u2022Food systems and sustainable agriculture. Food security has \nbecome an even more urgent challenge for poor rural communities in \nthe context of both Covid and rising temperatures driven by the \nclimate crisis, with the continuing dominance of industrial agriculture \nthreatening the economic independence of family farmers as well as \nimpacting local biodiversity and soil conservation and acting as a major \ncontributor to carbon emissions. Three of our advisors are specialists \nin this area, with one living as part of a collective farm run by Adivasi \ncommunity members. For the proposed work, we anticipate that this \ntheme will continue to be an important one across all of the \ngeographies in India where the Board operates.\n\u2022Access to forest rights, especially for Adivasi communities. The \nBoard has supported multiple Indigenous groups across India to \nexercise their right to protect, make decisions, and make a living from \ntheir traditional forests in the face of extractive interests. Several \ngroups have been supported for a number of years in this work, such \nas one organisation in Jharkhand (funded by Oak since 2016) working \nto secure forest rights, survey forest produce and trees, and promote \nwomen\u2019s involvement in the Gram Sabha. Two of our advisors have \nstrong links to Adivasi community movements and this theme will \ncontinue to be prominent in the proposed work.  \n\u2022Addressing the impacts of climate change and industrial \npollution on small-scale fishing communities. Fishing \ncommunities, like farmers, have been deeply impacted by climate \nchange in India as cyclones hit coastal areas with increasing intensity \nand frequency and sea level rise changes coastal ecosystems. One \ngroup supported by Oak Foundation via Greengrants in West Bengal \nhas been working to restore and protect mangroves in three villages \naffected by Cyclone Yaas, for example; others are especially focused on \nbuilding the leadership, organisation, and economic independence of \nwomen in fishing communities.\n\u2022Waste and sanitation issues, especially in relation to Dalit \nwomen and youth and to transgender people. Waste picking and \nmanual scavenging (cleaning human waste) generally falls on the most \nmarginalised people in India, especially Dalit women and youth who \nare frequently unpaid and often suffer severe health impacts and \nabuse; this work is an increasingly prominent theme in the Board\u2019s \ngrant-making, and recent grants have supported the organising, \neducation on rights and health, and registration of manual scavengers \nin informal settlements of Bangalore; another grant has funded work \nwith transgender waste pickers in Kolkata to improve health conditions \nand connect them to broader environmental justice movements.\nOak Application Form     11\nIn the context of the pandemic, the Board has adapted its approach to ensure \nmaximum flexibility and support to groups on the Covid frontlines, including \nwith the support of the Oak Foundation. Our grantee partners have shown \nenormous resourcefulness and resilience throughout this crisis, whether by \nadapting existing activities to ensure the safety of community members, or \nby developing new lines of work such as Covid prevention and awareness \nactivities, providing PPE or addressing the food security implications of the \npandemic.\nThe next phase of our partnership with the Oak Foundation\nAs India begins to move into the post-pandemic recovery phase, the Board is \nlooking ahead to the next phase of its existence and aims to continue scaling \nup its support to marginalised communities across India, building on the \nBoard\u2019s experience to date and also on the findings of the evaluation \nconducted on the previous phase of our partnership (attached \nseparately).  The strategy for this proposed next phase of our partnership \nincludes, firstly, exploring opportunities to support groups which the Board \nhas had less engagement with to date \u2013 whether in new geographies, or \nthose affected by additional dimensions of disadvantage such as trans or \nintersex identities. With one of the newest Board members from a Dalit \nbackground, the Board also aims to deepen its engagement with Dalit and \nother marginalised communities in the next few years, including by ensuring \nits own composition reflects that of its grantee partners in terms of gender, \nage, caste status, religion and geographical background. This need for \nenhanced focus on Dalit and other marginalised groups is one of the key \nrecommendations of the evaluation of the previous phase of our partnership \n(see 4.1.3, paragraph 101 and 4.3 in the evaluation).\nSecondly, the Board aims to strengthen its support to existing partners, \nrecognising there is scope in its work to support emerging civil society to \nbecome more established organisations with enhanced capacity to address \nsocial and rights challenges and to be more resilient and sustainable in their \nwork. In particular, this includes two changes to the Board\u2019s grant-making \napproach: increasing the size of the average grant made from $7,000 \nto $10,000; and moving towards providing multi-year funding \ncommitments to trusted partner organisations. This longer-term \napproach to funding will also strengthen our grantees\u2019 accompaniment work, \nenabling advisors to develop their relationships with grantee partners and to \nsupport them in becoming more sustainable and effective organisations over \ntime; it follows the recommendation of the evaluation that the Board \nconsider extending the size and duration of grants made (paragraph 4.1.1). \nThese changes will also be complemented and strengthened by the Board\u2019s \nparticipation in Global Greengrants Fund\u2019s emerging global learning \nstrategy, which aims to connect the different parts of our global grant-\nmaking network more effectively to foster improved learning and \ncommunication; in part this also responds to the recommendation in the \nevaluation that the access of our grantees to expert advice be supported \n(4.2.1).\nFinally, whilst individual Advisory Board members usually identify and \nsupport grantee partners in a specific state or cluster of states, an important \naspect of the Board\u2019s strategy for fostering a stronger civil society network \nin India is to develop and share expertise on these cross-cutting themes \nacross different geographies within India. This is reflected in the grant-\nOak Application Form     12\nmaking budget lines of the proposed work, which include a split of 60% \ngrant-making for local initiatives in West Bengal, and the remainder for work \nin other states. We recognise that the Foundation\u2019s strategy for India is \nstrongly focused on West Bengal, which is a critical state for our advisors\u2019 \nwork; by requesting some support to be earmarked to other states, our \nobjective is to ensure that grantees participating in grantee workshops and \nother engagement activities have the maximum opportunities to benefit from \nthe work of allied and aligned civil society organisations across all of India. \nFor example, as mentioned above, in the current phase of our partnership \nseveral network organisations based outside of West Bengal have been \nsupported, enabling grantees within West Bengal and outside the state to \nbenefit from resources, strategies and information through this peer support; \nexamples of these organisations include DISHA (the National Fish-workers' \nForum); the Save Our Rice Campaign (through PPUS); the Asia Pacific \nTransgender Network; and the North Bengal Forum of Forest People and \nForest Workers (through Bajkul). Our objective is to continue \nstrengthening this wider ecosystem of grassroots peer support with \nthe Foundation\u2019s support. This approach also follows a key \nrecommendation from the evaluation conducted on the previous phase of our \npartnership, that supporting strategic networking will be key for improving \nenvironmental conditions (see 4.1.2 and 4.2.2 in the evaluation attached \nseparately).\nFunding context\nThe proposed renewal funding from Oak Foundation would represent a \nmajor contribution to the India Advisory Board\u2019s evolving approach to \nsupporting grassroots civil society in India over the next three to four years. \nThe Advisory Board has continued to be successful in growing its \nengagement with other funders, including new multi-year commitments from \nseveral foundation sources in the UK, Europe and North America; through \nGlobal Greengrants Fund UK this includes renewed contributions from \nStichting SED Fund and the Human Capability Foundation, as well as \nportions of larger grant commitments secured in the past six months from \nthree large foundation donors. Cumulatively, the India Advisory Board\u2019s \nannual budget for FY21-22 (closing 30 June 2022) stands at $600,000 \u2013 a \nlarge increase on the initial budget of $332k for the first year of the most \nrecent phase of our partnership in 2018-19. The Advisory Board\u2019s budget for \nFY23 and FY24 is $744,000 per year. (To set this into the wider context of \nGGF UK\u2019s overall financial situation, GGF UK\u2019s overall budget is projected at \n$6.3m for the current fiscal year, and $6.2m for the next fiscal year.)\nIf approved, the currently proposed work would mean that the Oak \nFoundation would remain a significant funder of the India Advisory Board \n(though still well below 30% of the total India Advisory Board budget), but \nwithin a more diversified portfolio of restricted funders, as well as \nunrestricted support from Global Greengrants Fund. The global organisation \nhas also significantly grown its unrestricted revenue in the past year, \nmeaning that if the Board\u2019s work expands during the reporting period the \norganisation will be well placed to increase its budget further.\nThe proposed funding would enable the Board to provide 45-60 \ngrants of up to $10,000 per grant to emerging civil society groups in \nWest Bengal and other states in India, including a number of multi-\nyear funding commitments. As well as testing the viability of this new \nOak Application Form     13\napproach, the proposed funding will enable our grassroots partners \nto directly impact tens of thousands of beneficiaries through their \ninitiatives, and to become stronger, more autonomous and better \nresourced organisations.\nWith the support of the Oak Foundation, the Global Greengrants Fund India \nAdvisory Board aims to work towards an overarching objective of supporting \nemerging civil society actors in West Bengal and other states in India to \nbecome stronger, more resilient against external shocks, and more effective \nin carrying out their self-determined activities to address the social, \nenvironmental and rights challenges they face. As a result of this work, we \nexpect to see our grantee partners become better connected, resourced and \nnetworked; more effective in mobilising community engagement and in \nensuring the participation of women, youth and marginalised community \nmembers such as Dalits, Adivasis and other disadvantaged groups; and \nbetter able to access funding from other sources, decision-making spaces, \nand media coverage.", "6.

This higher \ngrant amount is intended to reflect the increased challenges affecting civil \nsociety organisations in India with mobilizing resources; to reduce \nadministrative burdens; and to enable local actors to become more effective \nin planning longer-term initiatives. For this proposed work, this will for the \nfirst time include multi-year funding commitments of up to three years for \ngrantees who are known to the Board, and who have the capacity to manage \nOak Application Form     15\nthese funds and to become stronger as a result, with the aim of building \nstronger and more resilient grassroots civil society organisations in West \nBengal and the other states in India where grantee partners operate. Our \nadvisors will play a critical role in supporting this capacity development, \naccompanying organisations to identify and address gaps in their skills, \nresources and infrastructure; for some (though not all) organisations \nsupported, this will enable them to secure additional funding from external \nparties, while other movements will have more specific and time-limited \ngoals.\n60 percent of the project\u2019s grantmaking budget will be channeled to groups \nin West Bengal, and 40 percent to the rest of India and to national networks, \nto allow facilitation of connections and learning across states, both by \nfunding network organisations and through the work of our advisors to \nconnect grantees working on related challenges across several states.\nWhile the specific focus areas and activities of the funded initiatives will be \ndetermined by the grantees themselves, with the support of our advisors, it \nis expected that the following themes and activities will continue to be \nprevalent in this work, based on the key trends identified under the previous \nphase of our partnership with Oak:\n- Issues affecting the rights of Dalit and Adivasi communities and other \nmarginalised groups, such as access to forest rights and government \nentitlements; participation in Gram Sabhas; and access to water and \nsanitation. (See also evaluation section 3.3.)\n- Issues affecting the rights of fishing and forest communities, again \nincluding access to the provisions of the Forest Rights Act; food security and \nagriculture; and the impact of extractive industries and pollution on \ntraditional livelihoods and health.\n- Climate change mitigation and adaptation, particularly in relation to \nsustainable agriculture and food security and resilience against the effects of \nclimate-linked disasters.\n- Environmental justice, particularly including advocating for the rights of \ncommunities affected by extractive industries and deforestation.\n- Sustainable development, livelihoods and agriculture\n- Women\u2019s environmental leadership, incorporating an intersectional lens \n(see objective 3 below), including participation in decision-making spaces, \nwomen\u2019s leadership of movements and local initiatives, and addressing the \nrights of trans women, women from Indigenous and Dalit communities, and \nother women who are affected by multiple dimensions of disadvantage.\n7.2.a. Objective 2 Objectives\nList here up to 3 main objectives for this grant (one sentence per objective). Think of objectives as goals \nthat can be achieved within the lifetime of the grant.  We encourage you to think of objective(s) that are \nambitious but also achievable.  \nOak Application Form     16\n2. Strengthen civil society networks among local organizations facing similar \nchallenges related to environmental justice and climate change in West \nBengal and across India, with the aim of enhancing emerging civil society \norganisations\u2019 capacity to protect their rights, environment and livelihoods; \nand to become more resilient against shocks, better resourced and better \nconnected.\n7.2.b. Objective 2 Expected Outcomes (bullet points):\nWhat do you expect will change because of this grant? What does success look like? List here \nthe main outcomes you hope to achieve or make significant contributions towards with this \ngrant, and for whom.  If you have concrete targets, please also list them here. Outcomes \ndescribe significant changes for people, communities, organisations or systems. Some \nexamples are changes in policies and legislation; changes in knowledge, awareness, \nattitudes, beliefs, behaviours or social norms; changes in capacities, level of influence, \nagency or access to services. Please refer to the guidance for additional examples.\nAs a result of the proposed work, by the end of the grant period we expect to \nsee organisations being better connected with one another and with wider \nnetworks, including through the accompaniment of our advisors; they will \nhave better access to external funding, decision-making and media spaces; a \nstronger understanding of the issues affecting them in their work and how \nthese link to other wider issues, including across India; and access to new \nresources, information and approaches that will strengthen their work and \nmake their organisations more resilient. Progress against these outcomes \nwill be assessed primarily through Greengrants\u2019 evaluation and learning \nframework as set out in section 9 below, with the additional support of our \nadvisors.\n72.c. Objective 2 Activities and timeframe (bullet points):\nList in bullet points the main types of activities that you plan to to carry out to achieve your \nexpected outcomes. Please keep these at a high level and and don\u2019t include the full list of \nevery activity you plan to carry out, instead, concentrate on the type of activities this grant \nwill fund. If your Programme Officer wants more information, we will ask you separately for a \nwork plan. Examples might include: (1) Research; (2) Provision of legal advice to...; (3) \nTraining on movement building for...\nThis objective links to the ambition set out in the previous phase of our \npartnership with Oak, in which we aimed to deliver a series of annual \nworkshops to connect grantees with each other, to exchange information, \nresources and learnings, and to foster a culture of mutual support between \nemerging organisations working on similar issues and challenges. With the \npandemic having prevented the workshops scheduled for 2020 and 2021, our \ngoal is to revitalise this work through a series of grantee meetings in West \nBengal and other parts of India, which will also incorporate a focus on \nstrengthening organisational resilience in the context of the pandemic and a \nOak Application Form     17\nchanging operating environment for many organisations; examples of this \ncould include training sessions on assessing risk, managing regulatory \nrequirements, and standardising operations, depending on the specific needs \nidentified by our advisors in discussion with grantees. By designing \nworkshops based on grantees\u2019 own identification of their needs in discussion \nwith advisors, our aim (which has been successful in previous years) is to \nincentivize and support grantee partners to participate in and shape a \ncommunity of civil society movements that has lasting impact beyond the \nlifespan of this grant.\nAs with the previous phase of our partnership, a portion of the grantmaking \nbudget will be used to support network and infrastructure organisations \nworking to build capacity for grassroots civil society in India.\nOur advisors will also continue to provide accompaniment and mentorship to \ngrassroots initiatives, including those funded in earlier stages of our \npartnership with Oak, as well as newer and emerging civil society initiatives. \nAdvisor accompaniment can include several different types of activity, but is \nalways provided where it is welcomed by grantees and never imposed on \nthem. Examples of the types of support our advisors provide include \nsupporting grantees to identify and tackle specific challenges in \nimplementing their projects; assisting them with developing relationships \nwith key external stakeholders, such as by facilitating introductions to \nrelevant officials or to media spaces; and strengthening leadership, \nparticularly of women, through fostering external connections or \nparticipating in capacity-building work, such as identifying resource needs, \nreviewing a funding strategy or supporting systems strengthening. Both the \ngrantee workshops and the advisor accompaniment will be critical to \nfostering stronger connections within and between the movements \nsupported by Greengrants, linking disparate actors and influencers and \ncreating collaborative spaces that are informed by grantee partners\u2019 own \npriorities and goals.\nAs one of the Greengrants network\u2019s largest advisory boards, the board will \nalso play a key role within Global Greengrants\u2019 evolving learning and \nevaluation strategy, which includes a focus on disseminating resources, \ntactics and information across the global network between advisors and \ngrantees working on related issues, but who may otherwise lack \nopportunities to learn from one another. This includes, for example, \nconnecting advisors and grantees around issues of safety and security, \nensuring that they have a good understanding of the mechanisms they can \naccess to support the rights of community members facing threats to their \nsafety, such as through the Environmental Defenders\u2019 Collaborative (hosted \nby Global Greengrants Fund); sharing expertise on topics including disability \ninclusion and trans rights; and exchanging examples of how advisors have \nbeen able to support grantees in addressing specific technical or legal issues \nin their work.  \nOur advisors in India, as with the rest of our global advisory network, will be \nsupported in this work by the Global Greengrants Fund Programmes team. \nSubrat Sahu, the Board Coordinator, will continue to liaise with Programmes \nstaff to ensure that the advisors are supported to identify and resolve \nchallenges in their grant-making and other work; as well as linking the Board \nto Greengrants\u2019 global learning, evaluation and network-strengthening work. \nPeer support forms an important part of Greengrants\u2019 advisory model, and \nOak Application Form     18\nthe regular advisor meetings included in the budget will serve as forums for \nadvisors to share their experiences and learnings, troubleshoot, and devise \nstrategies for addressing new challenges.\n7.3.a. Objective 3 Objectives\nList here up to 3 main objectives for this grant (one sentence per objective). Think of objectives as goals \nthat can be achieved within the lifetime of the grant.  We encourage you to think of objective(s) that are \nambitious but also achievable.  \n3. Support women and marginalised groups, particularly those affected by \nmultiple dimensions of disadvantage, to access their rights and make \ndecisions about their lives, communities and environments, by embedding an \nintersectional approach to diversity, equity and inclusion within all of the \nIndia Advisory Board\u2019s grant-making and accompaniment work.\n7.3.b. Objective 3 Expected Outcomes (bullet points):\nWhat do you expect will change because of this grant? What does success look like? List here \nthe main outcomes you hope to achieve or make significant contributions towards with this \ngrant, and for whom.  If you have concrete targets, please also list them here. Outcomes \ndescribe significant changes for people, communities, organisations or systems. Some \nexamples are changes in policies and legislation; changes in knowledge, awareness, \nattitudes, beliefs, behaviours or social norms; changes in capacities, level of influence, \nagency or access to services. Please refer to the guidance for additional examples.\nAs a result of the proposed work, by the end of the grant period we expect to \nsee an increased percentage of organisations and initiatives led by or \nfocused on the rights, perspectives and needs of women, particularly \nincluding women who are also affected by disadvantage as a result of other \naspects of their identities, for example trans women; Indigenous women; and \nwomen with disabilities.\n73.c.

Please keep these at a high level and and don\u2019t include the full list of \nevery activity you plan to carry out, instead, concentrate on the type of activities this grant \nwill fund. If your Programme Officer wants more information, we will ask you separately for a \nwork plan. Examples might include: (1) Research; (2) Provision of legal advice to...; (3) \nTraining on movement building for...\nThis objective directly links to and builds on the goal within the previous \nphase of Global Greengrants Fund\u2019s partnership with the Oak Foundation. \nGender remains a fundamental component of the India Advisory Board\u2019s \nOak Application Form     19\nanalysis and strategy; through the proposed work the Advisory Board will \nseek to further strengthen its support to local initiatives led by women, who \ncontinue to bear a disproportionate burden from social and environmental \nharms, now including the impacts of the pandemic and the increasingly \napparent effects of climate change. Overall, we will continue to channel at \nleast 30% of all of our grant-making to initiatives either led by women, or \nfocused on women\u2019s rights, safety, wellbeing and socioeconomic status; \nprioritizing women\u2019s leadership in environmental justice movements remains \na long-standing strategic objective for Global Greengrants Fund.\nWe will complement and deepen this commitment to strengthening women\u2019s \nrights by also incorporating an explicitly intersectional approach within our \ngrant-making, including channelling greater support to initiatives led by \nwomen, LGBTQI+ people and trans people, especially including those who \nalso identify as belonging to other groups which have historically been \nmarginalised, including Dalits, Adivasis, migrant workers, Safai \nKamancharis, and members of religious minorities. The India Advisory Board \nwill identify opportunities to explore and learn from the specific challenges \nof intersectional grant-making in India through the grantee workshops and \nwill also seek to adapt its own practices where necessary to ensure that its \ngrant-making and accompaniment work reflect intersectional approaches \nand concerns, for example by agreeing that a minimum percentage of grants \nmade will be to initiatives led by women who also identify as Indigenous, \nDalit, LGBTQIA, or as having a disability. This is also expected to include \nwork to ensure that the Board includes members whose gender \nidentifications, sexuality, religious affiliations, socioeconomic background, \ncaste status and indigeneity status reflects a diverse range of lived \nexperiences that mirrors those of the Board\u2019s grantees, with the objective of \nensuring that these grantee partners are supported by our advisors in a way \nwhich upholds their dignity and independence.\nThe India Advisory Board will work to address this objective in their work \nwith the support of the Coordinator, Subrat Sahu, and the Greengrants staff \nProgramme team, including Greengrants\u2019 Director of Gender and Equity, \nUrsula Miniszewski.", "8. COOPERATION": "8. COOPERATION  \nHow will you involve others in your approach to achieving change? If you are \nplanning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived \nexperience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  \nWhy are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are \nchoosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you \nusually work? (300 words):\nThe most important partners for this work are the Global Greengrants Fund \nIndia Advisory Board members; the Board\u2019s membership currently comprises \nfive Advisors, including one in West Bengal. The Board is supported by a \nCoordinator and an Administrator. The Advisors are all experts in their fields \nOak Application Form     20\nwith deep connections to local communities and civil society. They are \nresponsible for identifying grassroots actors who are working to change the \nsystemic causes of environmental destruction and social and economic \ninjustice, and work to strengthen these actors through flexible, responsive \nand strategic funding and accompaniment. Through this model, Global \nGreengrants and the Advisory Board seeks to ensure that the lived \nexperience of our community grantee partners is central to the social, \nenvironmental and rights initiatives the Board supports. Advisors are also \nthemselves deeply embedded in networks of support for grassroots civil \nsociety, including through links to Adivasi and Dalit organisations, as well as \nfarmer cooperatives and academia.\nAs in the previous phase of our partnership with Oak, we will continue to \nwork in partnership with other regional and international organisations such \nas Prospera International Network of Women\u2019s Funds as a partner in the \nGlobal Alliance for Green and Gender Action, as well as 350.org, Earth Island \nInstitute, International Rivers and Pesticide Action Network. We will also \ncontinue to identify other potential partners internationally and within India \nwho are able to support our grantees\u2019 work, potentially including local \nphilanthropic actors; within India Greengrants already has good connections \nwith intermediaries, philanthropic organisations and implementing \norganisations including AJWS, Holdeen Foundation, Fund for Global Human \nRights, Azim Premji Foundation, and aims to build on and deepen these \nrelationships and others during the proposed grant period. This work will \nalso be supported through Greengrants\u2019 global fieldbuilding strategy, which \nseeks to work with existing and emerging philanthropic actors globally to \nunlock additional resources for grassroots movements; while this global \nstrategy is still nascent we look forward to keeping Oak updated on our \nprogress, and appreciate the input that you are already providing to shape \nthe strategy.", "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING \nThis section is twofold. Please tell us:\na) Monitoring and evaluation. How will you know if you are achieving your objectives? Please \ndescribe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is working. \nIf you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or \nconduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.\nb) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or \ntest through this grant.\n(300 words):\nThe proposed work\u2019s approach to M&E is guided by an organisational \nlearning and evaluation framework designed on the basis of our theory of \nchange and our understanding of how environmental justice movements \ncreate and leverage social change. This incorporates tools including reports \nfrom grantees and advisors; grant-tracking systems; grantee surveys; \nlearning exchanges; participatory action research; grant strategy reviews; \nnetwork mapping; and in-depth regional case studies, to gather information \nabout the impacts of our funding on individual grantee organisations, \nOak Application Form     21\nbroader movements, and environmental and social conditions, and evidence \nof change. In-depth and longitudinal studies help us to map what long-term \naccompaniment and strengthening of a movement looks like.\nEach community group in receipt of a small grant and advisor support is \nasked to report on the progress of the project one year after receipt of the \nfunding. The reporting form asks for assessments and learning related to \neight indicators which align with Global Greengrants Fund\u2019s evaluation \nframework and help us assess impact:\n1. Any evidence of improved environmental conditions since receiving \nfunding\n2. Strengthened organisational capacity\n3. Increased community awareness or involvement\n4. Increased involvement of women, youth, and indigenous leaders in the \nwork of the initiative\n5. Impacts on policy or policy implementation\n6. Increased media interest in the grantees\u2019 work, if this is something that \nthe grantee seeks\n7. Increased access to spaces for decision-making and advocacy and \nnetworks\n8. Increased access to additional funding from sources other than \nGreengrants, or other forms of support (for example, expertise).\nIn addition, the report asks for a description of what the partner assesses to \nbe the most significant change, any changes in the external environment, and \nany lessons learned from the work. The reporting process invites our \ncommunity partners to reflect on their work and draw lessons. Reports also \nhelp advisors to analyse trends, inform the strategy-setting, and collate \nstories of success and learning; this data is collected by the Advisory Board\u2019s \nAdministrator with the support of the Coordinator, and analysis is conducted \njointly by the entire Advisory Board.\nThe framework set out above is designed to be as flexible and appropriate as \npossible for Greengrants\u2019 portfolio of grassroots, emerging civil society \ngroups who are highly likely to lack capacity to conduct monitoring and \nevaluation activities, and whose aims and approaches vary significantly \ndepending on the local context. Recognising this, Greengrants does not \ncurrently provide a more detailed framework for grantee partners to define, \nfor example, parameters for improved environmental conditions; the \nframework seeks instead to place grantee partners\u2019 own perceptions, rather \nthan externally imposed definitions, at the core of Greengrants\u2019 evaluation \nand learning work.\nFindings will be reviewed by Global Greengrants Fund staff and discussed \nwith advisors on a regular basis, including during virtual and (where \npossible) in person meetings, focusing on the impacts of individual and \naggregated grants, the challenges our partners face, and wider trends.\nAll advisory boards receive disaggregated data relevant to their \ngrantmaking, to help influence their future strategy-setting and decision-\nmaking, and improve the quality of support Global Greengrants Fund \nprovides. For the proposed work, we additionally plan to commission an \nOak Application Form     22\nevaluation in the final 5 months of the grant which will assess progress \nagainst the objectives outlined above, particularly including the degree to \nwhich the board has been able to incorporate an intersectional approach to \nits work, and any learnings from this which can be used to strengthen the \nboard\u2019s future grantmaking and accompaniment work. We will welcome the \ninput and feedback of the Oak Foundation in developing the terms of \nreference for this evaluation to ensure that it meets the Foundation\u2019s \nexpectations, particularly in terms of including grantee partners\u2019 \nperspectives.\nThe proposed work also links to Global Greengrants\u2019 evolving learning \nstrategy. This emerging piece of work, which will also intersect with the \norganisation\u2019s ongoing Strategic Journey, aspires to decentralise learning \nacross the Greengrants network and facilitate shared learning between \nadvisors and grantees across disparate geographies and themes. This will \nalso include evaluating the existing monitoring and evaluation framework to \nidentify opportunities for strengthening our approach and developing \nadditional insight that can strengthen our advisors\u2019 and grantees\u2019 work; this \ncould potentially include working with our grantees to strengthen their \nmonitoring and evaluation capacity.", "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGES\nWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your \noutcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?\nWe understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we \nexpect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be \nopen to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your \noutcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? \n(300 words):\nExternal high-impact risks identified for the proposed work include the \nongoing effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on communities with which we \nwork, and on the ability of our advisors to continue their grantmaking and \nmentoring support. The pandemic has had an enormous impact on our \ngrantees in India: lockdowns and travel restrictions represent a major \nbarrier to frontline community actors\u2019 ability to campaign, coordinate and \nbuild successful coalitions. To mitigate against these challenges, Global \nGreengrants has carried out several scenario planning exercises throughout \n2020-21 to help us navigate the impacts of the pandemic on our partners, \nand through our advisors we continue to apply maximum flexibility in our \nsupport to the activists and communities we work with.\nAnother external risk to highlight is the increasing frequency and severity of \nthreats to environmental defenders across the world. Global Greengrants is \nmanaging this risk by providing rapid, flexible and discreet emergency \nfunding to environmental defenders at risk identified by our advisory boards \nin Africa. We also house the Environmental Defenders Collaborative (EDC), a \npooled fund of 14 funders, which supports environmental activists by \nOak Application Form     23\nincreasing access to funding and strategic resources. We further work with \nother actors in the environmental space to increase understanding and \nimplementation of prevention and protection strategies, including in \npartnership with the Funders Initiative for Civil Society. Within India, we will \ncontinue to ensure that all the work supported complies with the \nrequirements of the FCRA and all other relevant laws and regulations.\nInternally, one risk with potentially major consequences is the risk of \nadvisors lacking capacity to deliver their work and / or facing burnout \nthrough stress, especially given the highly challenging external context and \nthe impact this is likely to have on advisors. To mitigate this, Greengrants is \ninvesting in an organisation-wide Organisational Care Initiative (OCI), \ncurrently being led by independent consultant Ishita Chaudhry, and which \nwill be coordinated by our new Director for People & Culture (starting \nSeptember 2022). The OCI aims to minimise the risk of staff burnout but also \nto actively promote a culture of care across the wider network, including \namong our advisors. The work of our Learning Consultant, Mateo Martinez \nAbarca, who is responsible for delivering our learning strategy and ensuring \nour advisors are connected with learnings and insights from across our \nadvisor network, will also be key in mitigating this risk.\nGlobal Greengrants Fund UK also maintains a risk register which has \nidentified key governance, compliance, financial, external and operational \nrisks as well as mitigation measures. The charity\u2019s trustees regularly identify \nand review the major risks to which the organisation is exposed. Both \nmanual and automated checks are regular invoked, particularly those \nrelating to the operations and finance of the charity, including through a \nfinance sub-committee of the Board, chaired by the Treasurer, which is \nresponsible for financial governance and risk management.\nIn addition to managing these internal and external threats, Global \nGreengrants Fund UK has in place a safeguarding policy, and jointly with our \nnetwork-wide Diversity, Equity and Inclusion working group has developed \nan internal code of conduct which aims to enable individuals engaged with \nGlobal Greengrants to uphold and safeguard the dignity, freedom and liberty \nof all people, in line with our commitment to developing and strengthening \nan enabling environment, and a culture of communication, trust and \nempathy, where the health, safety and the dignity of all persons associated \nwith our organisation, directly or indirectly, is given primacy.", "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11.  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS\nPlease use this space to respond to any specific questions from your Oak \nprogramme officer. If none were received, please leave this section blank. \nThere was mention of several of GGF\u2019s grantees maturing to the next \nlevel of funders, can you provide exact information on how many and \nOak Application Form     24\nhow much funding have been leveraged by the grantees independently \nand/or with GGF\u2019s support?\n27% of our grantees supported by the Oak Foundation have reported that \nwith Global Greengrants support they have been able to access additional \nfunding. Grantees have been able to secure funding from sources including \nAssociation for India\u2019s Development; ActionAid; The Asia Foundation; Both \nENDS; UNICEF; Millenium Alliance; Paul Hamlyn Foundation; Keystone \nFoundation; Oxfam India; and others.\nOur grantees typically haven\u2019t reported on the specific amount of funding \nleveraged from other sources, but the information that we have received \nindicates the following:\n\u2022Unspecified amount from Bosu Bigan Mandir for indigenous people \ndevelopment.\n\u2022Unspecified amount from Yuva Manthan Sanstha.\n\u2022Unspecified (\u201csmall\u201d) amount from government administration to train \nyouth members for a livelihoods initiative.\n\u2022Unspecified small grant from Foundation for Ecological Society for \ncapacity building of community forest rights management committees \nat the district level.\n\u2022INR10,00000 from Keystone Foundation.\n\u2022Unspecified additional funding to address the problems of food \ninsecurity due to COVID-19: from APPI for ration distribution in the \nBarwadih block of Latehar; from UHHIP to distribute rations in the \nBargarh, Bhandariya and Ranka block of Garhwa and from NCDHR to \ndistribute rations in the Mahaudand block of Latehar.\n\u2022Unspecified amount from AJWS for collaboration to further strengthen \nthe work of the campaign.\n\u2022Unspecified individual donations for things like construction of drinking \nwater wells, distribution of clothes, and solar lights distribution etc.\nIn addition, 23% of our grantees support by the Oak Foundation have \nreported that with Greengrants\u2019 support they have benefited from new \nnetworking opportunities and increased recognition from the wider \ncommunity. Organisations have been able to create more linkages with like-\nminded change players and access opportunities for further engagement and \ndialogue on issues pertaining to partnerships, collaborations, and funding. \nThis boosted organisations' capacity for knowledge-sharing and increased \nopportunities to access similar projects and mobilise government schemes \nfor action. Organisations also benefited from increased recognition and \nappreciation, exemplified by an increase of positive views towards the \ngrantees from the broader community. For instance, two organisations were \nconsulted by the national government and a UK-based organisation to \nprovide specialised pieces of training and knowledge on issues such as \nhuman trafficking, millet cultivation, and livelihood systems.\nGiven the ten-year long relationship with Oak, it will be good to know \nthe significant accomplishments/lessons drawn over these years. In \nother words, information on the impact GGF could make and the \nchanges brought about since their time of their association with Oak.\nOak Application Form     25\nThe funded work has strengthened individual organisations and the overall \ncivil society in India. Although not all have been able to access additional \nfunding from elsewhere, many have, and the majority report strong \nrelationships within and outside their communities and with organisations \nand individuals carrying out similar work in other regions. Through the \nnetworks they are a part of, grantees have been able to engage with state \nand national level bodies regarding forest rights, food security, and fishing \nrights.\nThe annual meetings arranged by Greengrants are a source of expert \nknowledge, in addition to being eagerly awaited solidarity events. The \nsources of the expert advice vary \u2013 from networks that they are part of (civil \nsociety, social movements) to academia and think tanks.  The critical support \nprovided by Greengrants is instrumental in access to more network meetings \nwhich are a source of information and knowledge. Some organisational \ngrantees are themselves experts in their own fields (and are recognised as \nsuch by the state) and provide expert advice to the community (from \naccessing entitlements, to access to larger networks, to plantations). While it \nhas not been possible to carry out these meetings during the pandemic years, \nwe are now starting to hold workshops again and look forward to sharing the \noutcomes of these with the Foundation.\nThe vast majority of grantees report that they have been able to make a \ntangible difference to their local environments thanks to the support of \nGreengrants and the Oak Foundation. There is a huge range of \nenvironmental improvements, from nurseries to organic farming led by \ntransgender people, to forest and mangrove protection and rejuvenation.\nIn all cases, communities are increasingly involved in and aware of the issues \nfacing them and the initiatives to combat them. Their skills and knowledge \nare increasing, and they have a strong understanding of the means at their \ndisposal. For example, some are using the Right to Information Act (RTI) \n2005 to get information and engagement with the state. In some of the forest \nvillages in Jharkhand, they were conversant with even the nuances of the \nScheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of \nForest Rights) Act, 2006, (popularly FRA), and used mapping for claiming \nrights.\nThe issues that the grantees are engaged with (livelihoods, forest rights, \nindigenous concerns, LGBTQIA+ rights, and access to urban housing and \nwater) are being covered more in the media.\nAlmost all the groups in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Madhya \nPradesh work with the indigenous peoples. Other marginalised communities \ncovered are small scale traditional artisanal fish workers (Maharashtra and \nWest Bengal), farmers (West Bengal, Tamil Nadu), and trans-persons (West \nBengal).\nMost of the grantee organisations were women majority or women oversaw \nthe project. One organisation was transwoman-led, and majority trans-\nperson. Women were articulate and present in substantial numbers during \nmost grantee field visits by our evaluator. In a few cases, women were a \nmajority. In some cases, the women were more articulate even when \noutnumbered by men. The focus on livelihoods, housing, water, and women\u2019s \nempowerment enables the participation of women even in adverse \nOak Application Form     26\ncircumstances.

Context (The context section should not exceed two pages.)\n6a. Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, \ngovernance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nFounded in 1973, Ipas is a pioneering global health and rights organization \nfocused on amplifying, defending, and advancing access to safe abortion and \ncontraception. We work in 29 countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America to \nshape the sustainable abortion ecosystem\u2014the context around an individual \nwho seeks to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. Ipas is governed by an 18-\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20135\nmember international Board of Directors of international professionals, medical \nproviders, and academics in the fields of health, SRH, and finances. The board \nincludes an Executive Committee, Finance and Investment Committee, Audit and \nRisk Committee, and other committees that set policies and review and approve \nIpas\u2019s long-term plans and annual organizational budgets. Board officers \nare Sandeep Prasad (Chair and former Executive Director of Action Canada for \nSexual and Reproductive Health and Rights), Monica Oguttu (Vice Chair and \nExecutive Director, Kisumu Medical and Education Trust), Trish Karlin (Treasurer \nand Executive Vice-President of Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation), \nand Carlos Plazas (Secretary and Chief Operating Officer of Planned Parenthood of \nMaryland). Senior leadership provides strategic and management leadership to \nIpas staff. Directors and Managers of Ipas\u2019s regional and country \nprograms design, implement and monitor programs, and Directors of technical and \noperational departments support technical innovation, development, and \nadministrative functions.  \n \nIpas is defining and implementing a system of shared leadership that shifts more \npower and some central functions to our country teams. The Ipas Country \nDirectors are leading on planning and implementing an Ipas Road Map to start \nusing the shared leadership approach. An example of this shift is the lead staff for \nour Quality-of-Care work across the world, is based in Kenya. This organizational \nshift is part of Ipas\u2019s commitment to break down harmful power structures, \nparticularly the neo-colonialism present in so many INGOs and global health \norganizations headquartered in the global north. \n6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\nIpas\u2019s FY22 organizational budget anticipates annual operating costs of USD \n42,240,000. We have confirmed support from European governments (including \nfrom Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), the Canadian \ngovernment, and many private US foundations. The structure of funding varies by \ngrant award or contract, with many multi-year grants, some one-year grants, and \ncontracts with partners to perform scopes of work or collaborate on projects. \nIpas\u2019s foundation and government grants are a combination of core and restricted \nfunding, with approximately 30% for core funding. In addition, Ipas has an \nindividual and major gifts program that exceeded its annual goals since 2020. We \nhave estimate reserves totalling USD 49,031,000 and no debt.\n \nThe largest change in Ipas\u2019s financial situation is due to changes in strategy of our \nlarge anonymous donor (LAD) that began in 2020 that negatively impacted Ipas\u2019s \nbudget as well as those of other INGOs dedicated to sexual and reproductive \nhealth and right (SRHR)\u2014support from LAD changed from $29.9 million in FY20 to \n$13.2 million in FY21 and has resulted in an organization restructure of our US \noffice, including a staff reduction (41 positions). Leadership worked to streamline \noperations, combining some departments and subcontracting out some \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\ninformation technology functions. This has required scaling down and re-planning \nprogramming, and we are being mindful to carefully navigate these shifts to \npreserve critical safe abortion programming, as we also improve collaboration \nwith partners. We have been moderately successful at increasing funding from \nsome of our existing donors and identifying new sources of funding.\n \nIDF was one of the recipients of a multi-country grant from LAD\u2014withdrawal of \nsupport from LAD negatively impacted IDF\u2019s operating budget by 40%. Like Ipas, \nIDF also mitigated this through strategic resizing and program changes and has \nnow successfully secured additional funds to overcome the impact of this and \ncontinue efforts to improve the abortion ecosystem in its program states and at the \nnational level.  \n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nIpas has worked for nearly 50 years to ensure that women and girls have improved \naccess to safe abortion and contraceptive care, which we consider crucial for \nimproved reproductive rights, health, and gender equality. Our efforts on four \ncontinents have improved SRHR for women living within a range of restrictive \nabortion settings. Areas of expertise include implementing evidence-based \ninitiatives to improve safe abortion access with governments, health providers, and \ncommunity organizations, expanding health workers\u2019 capacity and commitment to \nprovide abortion care, and conducting action-oriented research to advance \nreproductive rights, with a focus on centering the perspectives and needs of those \nseeking abortion care. Guided by a commitment to human rights, innovation, and \nsustainability, we are skilled at building relationships with diverse stakeholders at \nevery level of society, including within governments, institutions, and \ncommunities.\n \nIpas Development Foundation (IDF) is Ipas\u2019s implementing partner is India. IDF \nbegan work in India in 2001 to address the SRH needs of Indian women and girls, \nspecifically to reduce the incidence of unsafe abortion which continues to be the \nthird major cause of maternal mortality. IDF\u2019s presence in 10 states and women-\ncentered approach ensures that women and girls have improved knowledge, \nagency, and access to SRH care, including abortion and contraception. \nPartnerships with governments to achieve sustainability has resulted in: \nsustainable allocation of resources to support abortion care; consistent availability \nof essential equipment and supplies; increased numbers of trained providers to \nprovide high quality care; and strengthened national policies and technical \nstandards and guidelines to support a strong national abortion care program. As a \nresult of IDF\u2019s interventions, training, and advocacy, over 2,000,000 women and \ngirls have accessed services from over 5,000 public health care facilities (with over \n84% of these at the primary level).\n \nIDF\u2019s interventions in Jharkhand and West Bengal in previous projects supported \nby the Foundation have resulted in positive outcomes\u2014particularly in improving \nSRH knowledge among young women and girls, increasing service utilization and \ngreater recognition of SRH as an important health issue (please see Annexure 1). \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nIn Jharkhand, the endline evaluation shows statistically significant improvement in \noverall SRH indicators for knowledge, attitude, practices as well as stigma \nreduction, with the range of variation higher in the intervention group than in the \ncomparison area \u2013 the findings are supported by an upward trend in SRH service \nuptake in public health facilities. In West Bengal, qualitative assessment of our \nintervention reveals an overall positive impact in improving SRH of adolescent \ngirls (10-14 years) and young women (15-24 years)\u2014adolescent girls and young \nwomen reported increased confidence and ability to discuss SRH issues and \nfacility records show increase in utilization of SRH services in intervention \nfacilities. While the results are encouraging, there is a continued need for \nnurturing an overall enabling environment for adolescent and youth SRH in the \ntwo states\u2014some specific gap areas are mentioned in 6e.\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nIpas\u2019s programmatic strategy is based on the Ipas Strategic Framework which was \nrolled out in FY20. Ipas\u2019s Strategic Framework offers a vision and strategy for \nprogress on abortion access and rights that lead to programs that are fully \ngrounded in the local contexts of the countries in which we work. Ipas\u2019s Strategic \nFramework is based on our model for a sustainable abortion ecosystem. Ipas \ndefines the sustainable abortion ecosystem as \u201ca dynamic condition in which \nresilient local stakeholders and systems are actively accountable and committed to \nabortion rights and responsive to everyone\u2019s abortion needs.\u201d Ipas\u2019s Sustainable \nAbortion Ecosystem model recognizes that a single approach (legal reform, health \nsystem strengthening, community education and engagement) will not alone \ncreate real access for women and girls\u2014the full ecosystem needs to be addressed. \nUsing a human-centered approach with women at the center, our approach \nacknowledges that sustainable abortion care requires flexibility and prioritization \non how to collaborate with partners to achieve goals, and how to strike a delicate \nbalance across many factors. Our ecosystem model and strategic framework \nrecognize that sustainable abortion care must be driven by local stakeholders and \naddress multiple programming components to meet women\u2019s abortion needs. The \nSustainability Framework identifies eight programming components that must be \nunderstood for each local context to accurately assess needs, develop and \nimplement strategies, and monitor effective interventions. Underpinning the \nStrategic Framework is a continued commitment to a human rights and gender \nequality. Ipas articulates our work within a human rights analysis, and we partner \nacross movements to advance the bodily integrity of all people.\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nYoung Indian women and girls face tremendous challenges and stigma in meeting \ntheir SRH needs and the COVID-19 pandemic has made accessing information, \ncounselling and support, and services even more difficult. Young girls who marry \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\nearly are more likely to experience extreme social pressure of proving fertility and \nbear their first child before their body is ready for childbearing. As per latest NFHS-\n5 (2019-20), 42% of young women in West Bengal aged 20-24 years got married \nbefore the legal minimum age of 18 years, while among men around 20% aged 25-\n29 years got married before the legal minimum age of 21 years (IIPS 2020).  A \nsimilar trend is observed in the intervention district of 24 Parganas (South)\u201442% \ngot married before 18 years (IIPS 2020). The situation is somewhat similar in \nJharkhand. As per NFHS-4 (2015-16), 38% of women aged 20-24 years got married \nbefore the legal minimum age of 18 years, while among men around 31% men aged \n25-29 years got married before the legal minimum age of 21 years. Early marriage \nfurther leads to high teenage pregnancy\u2014in West Bengal 16% of women ages 15-19 \nyears were already mothers or pregnant at the time of survey, this was 13% in 24 \nParganas (South). Given these, young women constitute 30% of total maternal \nmortality in the country. The highest maternal deaths (34%) in India are also \nrecorded for young women ages 20-24 years (RGI 2019).\n \nMore than 33% of the disease burden and almost 60% of premature deaths among \nadults can be associated with behaviour or conditions that began or occurred during \nadolescence (GoI 2014).\n \nIpas\u2019s partner in India, IDF, implements community-focused interventions in \nJharkhand and West Bengal to address this, while also addressing specific gaps that \nwere revealed during the evaluation of the previous grant.\n \nJharkhand\nIDF\u2019s work under previous grants from the Foundation has yielded positive \noutcomes (please see Annexure 1); however, some key gap areas from the previous \ngrant include:  \n1) Women\u2019s agency around SRH-related decision making, negotiation skills with \nfamily members, and personal mobility is limited\n2) Socio-cultural barriers including gender norms that impede women\u2019s self-\nefficacy for SRH\n3) Men\u2019 involvement\u2014IDF\u2019s work through male youth leaders has improved men\u2019s \nattitudes towards women\u2019s SRH needs and interspousal communication, but more \nwork is needed to improve their acceptance of contraceptives and strengthen their \nability to support their spouses in negotiating SRH discussions within \nfamilies/communities\n4) Need to decentralize SRH services for improved access\n \nOpportunities:\n\u2022Strong foundation for a favourable SRH ecosystem established in the \ncommunity\n\u2022Community-based evidence to guide strategies on addressing continuing \nSRH gaps and evolving needs of young women\n\u2022health system interventions for holistic impact (through separate IDF funds)\n \nChallenges:\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139\n\u2022Potential government COVID-19 restrictions\n\u2022Resistance from the community due to fear of the pandemic\n \nWest Bengal (WB)\u2013 existing intervention areas\nThe often-overlooked SRH needs of adolescents and young women \u2013 particularly \nyoung adolescents (10-14 years) \u2013 are unique and critical, as early intervention \nlays the foundation for positive SRH outcomes.

Community-based endline assessments will \ndemonstrate the impact of our community outreach in improving the overall \necosystem for SRHR (scope and methodology to be decided by the end of Year \nOne).\n \nIn new intervention areas in West Bengal, community-level evaluations will \nexamine the initial effectiveness of our interventions. Using a quasi-experimental \ndesign baseline research will assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards \nSRHR issues, as well as agency and gender equity-related aspects among young \nwomen. Partners of young married women will also be surveyed to assess their \nrole. In addition to setting benchmarks for selected output indicators, the baseline \nstudy will help identify barriers and facilitating factors to SRH services.

Our Program staff are based in the regions where we have a \nprogram presence. In addition, each regional program has a part-time or full-\ntime consultant based in a different priority country who serves as an essential \nmember and key advisor within the team.\nThe Fund\u2019s global board of directors currently has eighteen members, and is \ncomprised of high-profile human rights experts, frontline activists and \ncommitted human rights grant-makers and donors.  Board terms are three \nyears, and the Fund\u2019s bylaws state that the Board cannot include more than \nfive directors who have served over three terms.  According to the Fund\u2019s by-\nlaws, at least one-third of the board members must be \u201cof or from the regions \nserved.\u201d  The Fund\u2019s board meets in person twice a year and virtually twice a \nyear, and additionally has several standing board committees that meet \nthroughout the year. As required by law, the Fund\u2019s UK entity also has a small \nboard of trustees which also sit on our global board.\nThe Fund is committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion within \nour organization. We strive to maintain a board and staff that are reflective \nof the diversity of its work. We value diversity in all its forms \u2013 of thought, \nbackground, identities, and lived experience \u2013 in the composition of our \nteams and our recruitment of new staff. Specifically in relation to advancing \nrace equity, in recent years the Fund has made concerted efforts to further \ndiversify its board and leadership team, one example being that during the \nprocess of hiring our new CEO the Fund deliberately worked with a global \nrecruitment consultancy to support us in our search, with a priority focus on \ncandidates who would bring race diversity to our leadership.\n 5b. Summarise the organisation\u2019s history.  In addition, highlight 2-3 key \nachievements.\nPlease keep this brief and list up to 3 key achievements as bullet points. Even though \nyou may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the \nproposed grant. (300 words)\nThe Fund is well positioned to remain a critical funder and ally to activists, \ngroups and movements on the frontlines of human rights struggles in the \nregion. The Fund began working in India in 2003, choosing to focus on the \nhuman rights dimensions of poverty and funding a combination of national and \nstate-level groups that worked with the most marginalized populations (Dalits, \nOak Application Form     6\nTribals, informal sector workers and women across all marginalized groups). \nSince then, the Fund has disbursed nearly $20million in grants to around 200 \ngroups across India. Over the years, with Fund support, these grantees have \nmade a significant impact on the human rights landscape in areas such as land \nrights, labor rights, and sexual rights, and in particular for extremely \nmarginalised communities (Dalits, Tribals, etc.). The Fund typically supports \na strategic cohort of 35-45 groups in India with an annual budget of roughly \n$1.2million. When strategic funding opportunities arise we are able to expand \nour grantmaking portfolio and reach, as our previous support from Oak has \nenabled us to do.\nThe Fund\u2019s India Program currently has a grantmaking portfolio of around 40 \ngrantees, including a few groups based outside of India who are some of the \nmost impactful actors able to advance international advocacy and media \nefforts as those based in India simply cannot due to the security risks and \nhostile environment.\nOur three key achievements related to our India programming include:\n1.The Fund remains a key ally and lifeline to activists: the Fund is \nnow one of a few human rights funders still able to work in India and \nchannel resources to the grassroots level, in part due to our deliberate \nefforts to operate under the radar and with grantee security and \nconfidentiality remaining our top priority. In the context of India, this is \na major achievement. The Fund\u2019s critical support to frontline activism \nincludes our continuing support to the Legal Defense Fund, one of the \nonly mechanisms of its kind in India \u2013 created to provide urgent \nresources to HRDs and organizations in emergency situations in India, \nespecially related to cases of criminalization. This unique rapid response \nfund was set up four years ago in collaboration with Holdeen and \nAmerican Jewish World Service, first incubated at the Fund and for \nsecurity reasons now housed at the Robert Kennedy Centre in \nWashington DC. Requests for support are peer reviewed by leading \nactivists. In the last three years almost 70 HRDs at risk have received \nemergency grants through this initiative for urgent legal assistance, \nemergency medical care, relocation, etc. Almost 70% of HRDs supported \nso far by this mechanism have been those working on environmental \nissues.\n \n2. A major priority of the Fund\u2019s programming in India is to support newly \nformed grassroots groups who are able to use the flexible, general \nsupport funding we provide to build a strong foundation for their work. \nFor some, our funding \u2013 often seed grants \u2013 can be \ntransformational. The majority of Fund grantees in India are also led \nby those who are from the same constituency that they work with \n(including women, Dalit, Muslim and Adivasis).\n \nThe Fund strives to support activists and groups working innew and \ncreative ways to advance human rights and social justice and to \nbroaden their constituencies, in particular to youth. For example, the \nFund\u2019s support has extended to activists using arts and culture to help shift \npublic narratives, such as in 2018 we partnered with Marathi YouTube \nchannel BhaDipa and the media and arts collective Maraa. Together, we \nOak Application Form     7\nhelped underrepresented voices break into India\u2019s booming stand-up comedy \nscene. On our 16-city tour of Maharashtra, comics from some of India\u2019s most \nmarginalized communities shared their personal stories, laughs, and \nimportant messages of social change with new audiences across the state. \nAnother example is the Fund\u2019s recent support to a collective of artists (incl. \npainters, writers and actors) that are working to amplify the voices of \nmarginalized communities affected by the climate crisis and environmental \nhazards and to raise awareness on and mobilize community-led ecological \nconservation. This includes a cultural festival on World Water Day, and \ncommunity -led cleaning of the Nonadaanga pond - a part of the East Kolkata \nWetland under threat from urbanization which is the only Ramsar site in the \nworld whose rich biodiversity has the ability to recycle the city\u2019s sewage into \nprofitable agriculture and fishing that could help feed the city at low cost.\n5c.

(600 words):\nProblem Analysis\nThe consequences of climate change in India - including eroding coastlines, \ndestroyed ecosystems, catastrophic weather events and poorly designed \nclimate mitigation and development projects - are deepening existing \ninequalities. Climate change is a threat multiplier, and populations in India \nthat already are vulnerable because of factors such as geography, poverty, \ngender, indigenous or minority status, national or social origin, birth or other \nstatus, and disability, continue to face its harshest effects. The nexus of the \nclimate crisis and socioeconomic and political inequalities is at the root of \nvarious types of climate injustices in India, and this is particularly pertinent in \nthe state of West Bengal.\nWest Bengal is a very unique state in India that is still grappling with the \neffects of its contested history under British rule, and the post-independence \npolitical and economic stagnation that followed after years of being one of the \nrichest regions in the world. Today, West Bengal has a fragile economy and is \none of the poorest regions in India, attributed, in part, to years of communist \nrule that shunned industrialization and modernization, and the growing effects \nof extreme weather \u2013 such as flooding \u2013 that together are leaving many families \ndestitute and are driving people to migrate to other states. Yet at the same \ntime, West Bengal is home to some of the richest biodiversity and natural \nresources in India, including pristine forests with diverse fora and fauna, much \nof which have been carefully preserved and protected by tribal communities \nand other forest-dwelling communities who have lived there for centuries and \nare highly dependent on the forest for their livelihoods and food sovereignty.\nHowever, West Bengal\u2019s ecology and pristine forests, as well as the lands, \nlivelihoods, culture and identity or the many indigenous communities that \nreside in them are increasingly under serious threat from a growing turn \nOak Application Form     8\ntowards major investments in development, natural resource extraction and \nhighly urbanized practices. One of the recent examples is the proposed \nDeocha-Panchami- open cast coal mining project of West Bengal State which \nsupports the eviction of many communities.\n \nFurthermore, whilst there are solid laws in India to protect the community \nrights of indigenous groups, as well as the land they inhabit \u2013 such as the \nForest Rights Act (FRA) \u2013 implementation of these laws remains poor, and \nrecent amendments in laws related to forests and the environment at both \nstate and central government level have been contradictory and difficult for \ncommunities and civil society to predict and respond to. Majoritarian \ngovernance is also eroding constitutional democracy and the rule of law, and \ndisempowering communities. Recent policies and actions have supported \ncorporate mining and other interests, such as in 2021, India\u2019s Ministry of \nEnvironment issued an order to help some mining projects avoid public \nenvironment clearance hearings which are a critical tool for good governance \nand an important process for mining-affected communities, who may be \nsuffering from non-compliance of mandatory environmental safeguards in \nmining projects. India\u2019s Wildlife Protection Act has also been responsible for \nthe large-scale relocation of tribal communities, and an increased \ncriminalization of forest communities, as documented in this recent report by \nCentre for Police Accountability.\nThis deeply concerning trend is intensifying and happening within a broader \ncontext of civic space and activism being severely curtailed across India as the \nstate seeks to silence all dissent; today, India is one of the most dangerous \nplaces in the world to be a human rights defender (HRD), especially for those \nadvocating around environmental issues who are easily labelled as threats to \nnational security.\n \nThe Fund\u2019s Response & Learning\nThe Fund\u2019s work related to environmental issues in India is currently focused \nin Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal and more recently expanded to \nChhattishargh and Jharkhand. However, the Fund has deepened its strategic \nfocus and investment in West Bengal in recent years considering the needs on \nthe ground and the critical window of opportunity the current moment \npresents in this state as it is on the cusp of major development and greater \ndemands on its land and natural resources. The Fund knows that in the face \nof these growing threats it is imperative that local communities, particularly \nindigenous and forest-dwelling communities, be supported now to elevate \ntheir voices and power to demand their constitutional rights to land and access \nto natural resources, before private sector interests and deforestation take \nhold.\nOver the last few years, thanks to Oak\u2019s support, the Fund supported a number \nof community-led efforts in West Bengal to promote and protect the rights of \nindigenous and forest-dwellers affected by environmental issues, large \ndevelopment projects, land displacement, and forced evictions. We have \ngathered important learning about the most effective strategies to help \ncounter and navigate the growing threats outlined above, which have informed \nour strategic priorities in the years ahead and for which we are seeking Oak\u2019s \ncontinued support and partnership.\nOak Application Form     9\nAs many climate solutions are inextricably linked to social and economic \njustice in India, the Fund has supported advocacy and lobbying efforts with \nthe government to ensure indigenous communities\u2019 identities and culture are \nprotected, as well as on promoting food sovereignty and sustainable \nagricultural practices.\nFrom our experience we have learnt that climate change can be mitigated, and \nenvironmental justice facilitated when communities are economically resilient, \nwomen have equal and equitable access to resources and to power, younger \npeople feel stronger community connectedness, and citizens are collectivized \nand have the knowledge of laws and policies that impact them and their \nenvironment.\nThe Fund is pleased to report that through Oak\u2019s current grant for work in \nJhargram, West Bengal, local groups and activists have made significant in \ntheir work over the last few years, and the results of this are extremely \nencouraging, and on which we are seeking to build. Over the last few years:\n\u2022Targeted communities in Jhargram, Purulia and Bankura have \ndemonstrated increased capacity to self-organize and claim their \ncommunity/individual forest rights.\n\u2022Perhaps most notably, at the time of writing this, up to now communities \nhave been supported to form 15 Gram Sabhas - 9 in Nayagram Block and \n6 in Binpur II Block - and so far 8 are in the process of claiming \ncommunity forest rights, with others are in the process of preparing \ntheir claims for submission. These 8 claims in process represent the \nrights of a total of 584 families and land 1,597 hectares in size, which \ndemonstrates the huge reach and potential impact of community-level \ninstitutions like Gram Sabhas and their collective action.\n\u2022Another inspiring outcome has also been that some leaders of Gram \nSabhas took initiative to form a platform/network of local Gram Sabhas \n- Banadhikar Gram Sabhas Mocha \u2013 which has since held two annual \nconvenings of local Gram Sabhas, involving local leaders and forest \nrights activists from a number of villages. The last convening, held \nearlier in 2023, was attended by 200 people which demonstrates the \nappetite for such platforms and spaces. The convening included rich \ndiscussions. Banadhikar Gram Sabhas Mocha has also been able to \nsuccessfully liaise with and advocate with the District Magistrate and \nother District officials in instances where Gram Sabhas claims are not \nbeing responded to, helping to amplify communities\u2019 voices and \nconcerns. Another positive development is that the organizers of this \nMocha are now engaging themselves in discussing livelihood issues. The \npotential of this platform is extremely promising.\n\u2022One of the most important achievements noted by our grantees has been \nthe change in attitude of government departments towards the forest \nrights campaign and work in Jhargram. When they started the work and \nhelped Gram Sabhas to submit claims after meticulous preparation, \nnone of the government departments showed any interest, rather they \nwere actively discouraged from filing submissions. After two years of \nhard work and regular engagement with District officials, they are now \npublishing a booklet about the FRA, Gram Sabha and forest rights \nclaims, publishing and circulating claim forms. The District Magistrate \nis now also promising to look into claims submitted and giving \nOak Application Form     10\ninstructions to his subordinate officers on the same and most \nimportantly, the Forest Department is acknowledging the process and \nsending Forest Officers to talk about FRA claims in a gathering \norganized by the very same community, with whom they share a \ncontentious relationship. This is a major shift and step forward for State \nrecognition and action in relation to community forest rights.\n \nKey learnings from our work in West Bengal so far have shown that:\n- the most important and effective way to engage and mobilize indigenous \ncommunities to claim their rights to land is to equip them with greater \nunderstanding of the connection between their cultural identity, traditional \npractices and customary laws, to the protection of and access to land. We have \nseen through our grantees\u2019 work that focusing on this intersection \u2013 helping \npeople to see that land is not just a resource but part of indigenous cultural \nidentity \u2013 is the most powerful and successful way to empower and mobilize \ncommunities for action.\n-equipping communities with a greater understanding of their constitutional \nrights and legal provisions is critical\n- supporting efforts to strengthen the forest governance structure through \npeople centric conservation practices through constitutional remedies such as \nthe PESA, FRA etc. allows communities to demonstrate the meaning of \nconservation and protection of their natural resources\n- supporting communities to mobilize, form Gram Sabhas and process \ncollective claims takes considerable time, accompaniment and trust-building, \nbut is an essential process in empowering communities and ensuring the \nrealization of their rights\n- communities need sound legal aid in order to claim their rights and respond \nto emerging threats, including criminalization by the state.\n \nSupport from Oak\nThe Fund seeks a new 4-year partnership with Oak and a grant of $575,000 to \nhelp bring the resources and actions needed in this critical moment for \ngrassroots level organizing on land and resource rights issues in West Bengal. \nWith Oak\u2019s support the Fund would build on the success and learning from \nprevious work and support a cohort of 4 local groups working on their \ncommunities\u2019 management of and rights to natural resources in West Bengal, \nlikely focused in Jhargram, Purulia, Paschin Bardhaman, Bankura, Alipurduar \nand Cooch Behar Districts. The Fund would continue to support 2 existing \ngrantees and seek to expand support to 2 new grantees. With Oak\u2019s support \ngrantees will receive the resources and support to build on their work, \nprogress and learning so far, with a deepened focus on building community \nawareness of the power in their cultural identity and heritage, its connection \nto land, and in pursuing their constitutional rights to land ownership and \naccess. Grantees will be able to continue supporting communities to claim land \ntitles, to scale up their outreach and mobilization efforts into new areas, and \nto advocate for West Bengal\u2019s Forest governance structure to be \nstrengthened, ensuring communities have the power and voice in the process \nthrough building grassroot mobilization of community-based organisations \nOak Application Form     11\nsuch as Banadhikargram sabha morcha and Uttar Banga Vanjan Shramajeevi \nManch.\nAs far as our grantees liaising with the government departments, this will \nhappen to some extent, especially with district administration, forest \ndepartment, and nodal agencies such as the Department of Backward class \nwelfare who is primarily responsible for the implementation of Forest Rights. \nHowever, grantees likely will not lobby or advocate directly with these \ndepartments since the Gram Sabha Morcha \u2013 an important people\u2019s \nnetwork/forum- will take the lead in having direct dialogue with government \ndepartments on behalf of its communities. Similarly, North Bengal groups will \nengage with such departments since they are already working on forest rights \nalthough it is not directly supported by our funds.\nOur proposed work would align strongly with the Fund\u2019s strategic priorities \nto shift more resources to grassroots environmental activists and solutions in \nIndia, to build indigenous communities\u2019 resilience and power on \nenvironmental issues and their rights, to support intersectional approaches \nto activism, and to help nurture a grassroots climate justice movement that \nhas indigenous communities, women and youth at its heart and helm.", "6.

Monitoring and evaluation:\nThe Fund has developed a strategic framework for each country that guides \nthe Fund\u2019s allocation of its resources and provides a means for evaluating its \ngrant-making over time. Each grantee will be required to submit a proposal \nevery year outlining their proposed work and goals for the year ahead and \nproposed qualitative and quantitative indicators to track developments and \nprogress. The Fund\u2019s program staff in India will then speak with each grantee \nto jointly set indicators \u2013 aligned to what we have outlined in this proposal - \nthat they will use to determine whether their efforts are moving in the desired \ndirection.\nThe assessment of these indicators is done typically through six monthly \nnarrative reports.  Alongside these grantee reports, the Fund\u2019s program staff \nin India will maintain regular communication with grantees \u2013 likely every \nquarter - as an important part of building strong relationships rooted in trust, \nand to help maintain open discussions on progress and challenges on their \nwork and strategies.

(300 words)\nA vertical HIV intervention program was launched in 1992 following a base \nline study conducted by All India Institute of Hygiene & Public Health \n(AAIH&PH), a Central Govt. institute. The objective was to initiate STD and \nHIV prevention program in Sonagachi, a red light zone in Kolkata, India. The \nintervention programme started with three principal components: provision \nof health services including STD treatment; information, education and \ncommunication (IEC); and condom programming. It was in the year 1995 out \nof felt need by the community members followed by several discussions and \nconsultations, a unique body of the \u2018fallen women\u2019 was formed;  Durbar \nMahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC) came into existence. This is a forum \nexclusively set up and managed by sex workers and their children with the \nobjective of creating solidarity and collective strength among the sex worker \ncommunity and other marginalized groups.\n1. The success of DMSC run HIV intervention program is known as \n\u2018Sonagachi model\u2019 being the most successful intervention among sex \nworkers globally. This has helped National Govt. to articulate a \nstrategy called Targeted Interventions for the high risk communities \nlike sex workers, Transgender, MSM population. Based on the \u2018Lesson \nLearnt\u2019 from Sonagachi Project, NACO (National AIDS Control \nOak Application Form     6\nOrganization) articulated the concept of \u2018Creating Enabling \nEnvironment\u2019 and \u2018Community organizing and Ownership \nbuilding\u2019 what became the budgeted and integral component of HIV \nintervention program. The principles of Sonagachi model was taken to \nbuild the foundation of .Bill and Melinda Gates supported HIV \nintervention program in India spending $350 Million. Both these \nstrategies were also accepted by all UN agencies including big donors \nlike the Global fund DFID etc. in their programmatic approach.\n2. Durbar is a founder member of All India Network of Sex Workers \nwhich at present represent 85 community based organizations of sex \nworkers and TG spread across 18 states in India.\n3. Durbar is part of numbers of National networks and campaign \nmovements like Rights to Food campaign, Rights to education \ncampaign, the Pension Parishad, NREGA Sangharsh Morcha and many \nothers.\n4. We are register member of National Trade Union Initiative [NTUI], a \nnational level trade union in India. The forum  of informal sector \nwomen in the state of  West Bengal which represent voices of around \none hundred thousand women workers belonging to 18 different \noccupational group is jointly headed by a sex workers representative \nfrom Durbar\n5. Durbar is part of many women networks who are fighting against \ngender discrimination, violence against women e.g. Maitreyee, \nSramajibi Swikriti Mancha in West Bengal.\n6. Durbar\u2019s cultural wing has been very successful who are selected to \nperform in the Opening Ceremony of International AIDS Conference \nheld in Geneva as well as they were invited in the last two ICAAPs held \nin Bangkok and Dhaka respectively. The cultural team of Durbar also \ntook part in the \u2018India Got Talent\u2019 program and reached to the finals of \nthe said program.\n7. In the arena of sports, 8 kids from Durbar were selected for various \nage group national level tournaments.

Usha \nwas selected as one of the best models in the co-operative movement in \nWest Bengal in 2016.\n11. In the field of education DURBAR fought a bitter battle to enroll \nchildren of sex workers in formal school. In early days they were \ndenied admission, with a tenuous effort based on advocacy and \nnegotiation we succeeded admission of children, since last three years \non an average one hundred and fifty children per year could complete \nschooling. We also run a hostel for 6these kids which accommodate \neighty children\nThe Right to Food and Work Campaign West Bengal that has been in \nexistence since 2001. In the last seven to eight years with the financial \nassistance from the OAK foundation it has made the following major \ncontributions to the issue of food security: -\n\u2022It has been able to strengthen its network and spreads its network in \n20 districts in the state.\n\u2022In number of cases unpaid wages under the MGNREGA has been paid \nby the government due to strong intervention of the Campaign. In the \nyear 2017 \u2013 18 due to intervention of the campaign about 881 persons \nwere paid their due wages and the approximate amount is \nRs.17919540/-\n\u2022Several times, teams on behalf of the Campaign conducted studies in \nthe tea gardens in North Bengal. Through the studies and fact findings, \nthe campaign prepared a number of reports and calculated dues of the \nworkers from the management. From time to time these reports were \nsubmitted to the both the central and state government as well before \nthe Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court of India. And finally on 4th April, 2018 \nHon\u2019ble Supreme Court in a contempt proceeding of a case filed by \nPaschim Banga Khet Majoor Samity and other unions directed the \ngovernment of West Bengal to pay Rs. 15 Cr. to the workers as an \ninterim relief.\n\u2022The campaign organized  training programs for the tea garden workers \nregarding the procedure of filling claim forms also members of the \ncampaign are consistently monitoring the proper implementation of the \norder passed by Hon\u2019ble Court on 4th April, 2018 and to find out the \nproblems of the workers to fill the forms.\n\u2022The Supreme Court in 2020 constituted a one-member committee \nheaded by retired Supreme Court judge A.M. Sapre to inspect and \nverify the claims of workers. The hearing by Justice Sapre's Committee \nwas delayed due to Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns. However, on \n15.09.2021, the Committee passed an order stating that all the \nworkers of these 29 gardens would have to submit their claim forms \nand which is an ongoing process till date.\n\u2022Fact finding in to the starvation deaths at Bhatpara, North 24 \nParganas, Purulia and Lalgarh, Jhargram have been conducted. This \nhas led to relief programs for the victims and sometimes their \ncommunities. In the recent case of hunger death in the district of \nOak Application Form     8\nJhargram the state government is made accountable and a complaint \nhas been filed to NHRC.\n\u2022Right to Food and Work Campaign have successfully supported a \nseminar of beneficiaries which was a long due plan. In the said seminar \naround 300 delegates from 17 districts of Bengal and 36 other \norganisations came together at Rammohon hall. The objective was to \ninvolve beneficiaries in the campaign to monitor the implementation of \nNFSA, MGNREGA and this seminar is a significant step towards this \nobjective.\n\u2022As per state food security scheme in West Bengal RKSY-I & RKSY-II \n(Rajya Khadya Suraksha Yojana) are the two ration card types under \nwhich wheat and rice is given to poor people through Public \nDistribution System (PDS) / Fair Price Shop (FPS). The RKSY (I & II) \nration cards are issued to the most financially weaker section of the \nstate who are left uncovered under National Food Security Act, 2013 \n(NFSA). Under the state food security scheme, the entitlements as well \nas the subsidized price differs to get dry rations from Public \nDistribution system. The RKSY-I beneficiary gets monthly 5KGs of \nration (3 KGs of Wheat per month at the FPS price of ?2 per KG and \n2KGs of rice per month at the FPS price of ?2 per KG). Whereas, RKSY-\nII ration card beneficiary gets 2 KGs of ration (1 KG of Wheat per \nmonth at the FPS price of ?9 per KG and 1KGs of rice per month at the \nFPS price of ?13 per KG). The entitlement of ration under RKSY-II was \nalready less and was pricier than RKSY-I,the Campaign had advocated \nfor the increase in allocation of the PDS entitlements and to ensure \nequal benefits for RKSY-II card holders. As a result of which, the \ncampaign claims that RKSY-II (Rajya Khadya Suraksha Yojana-II) ration \ncard holders had got 5 kgs of rations per card per month from PDS at \nno cost for the initial phase lockdown, but in the later lockdown \nphases, the original entitlement of 2 KGs of ration per card per month \nwas restored for RKSY-II ration card holders at free of cost. And till \ndate the RKSY-II ration card holders are receiving the ration as per \ntheir entitlement at free of cost throughout the state.\n\u2022The strength of our partner organisations has grown due to adequate \nknowledge of the scheme and laws. As such, they can make the \ngovernment officials function to implement various schemes.\n\u2022During the induced lockdown and post lockdown the campaign has \nconducted two research studies to understand the hunger status and \nthe findings of which has been shared with the state government for \nthe proper implementation of food security in the state.\n\u2022The campaign has able to capacitated more than 40 individuals as \ncommunity leaders identified by the partner organisations.\nCoordination amongst partner organisations has improved and we have \nlearned how to work together.\nOak Application Form     9\n5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? \nHow will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and \ndecide your approach?

Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nRTF&W Campaign WB is addressing the problem of food security, focusing \nespecially on hunger deaths and malnutrition. It is working especially on the \nrights to food and work.  Its work is at various levels. For example, at the \ngrass roots level, it works to ensure that people know about existing rights \nsuch as the Supreme Court orders on Right to Food, the NFSA and the \nMGNREGA. It also understands through the experience at the grass roots \nabout lacunae in the implementation of these rights and mobilises and \ncampaigns to deal with these lacunae at the administrative level. In addition, \nit also defines and lobbies and campaigns for an expansion of these rights at \nthe State and National level. Civil society activists and local leaders are \nactively participating in the movement to add momentum and influence the \npolicy makers to be pro poor in nature. The emergent leaders and the CBOs \nare taking up issues at the micro level and challenging the Panchayat, Block \nand District administration to be accountable and transparent in their \nexecution of these rights.\nThe challenges facing the Campaign are as follows:-\nThe groups, individuals and the community leaders face difficulties related to \npressure from local goons. Besides threats from the local leaders, the \nadministration sometimes creates hindrances in effective implementation. \nRed tapism and too many bottlenecks related to documents and evidential \nproof takes more time in actual initiation of the actions to be taken.\nOrganisations are at various levels of understanding of issues and in \ncapacities to deal with such issues. A big challenge is that there are large \nstretches of blocks and districts where our work has had no impact so far \nand where we do not have any partners.\nA big challenge is to maintain communication and co-ordination amongst \nmember organisations of the campaign. The North-South divide in the state \nin terms of distances as well as issues and even language means that the \nCampaign will have to have parallel activities for different areas.\nSimilarly, another challenge is to convince member organisations to move \nout of the project mode (where food security issues are taken up only when \nthere are funds for a project) to the movement mode where these issues \nbecome part of their work on a long term basis.\nThis in fact would be the main focus of the project i.e. building capacities \nand understanding to go from viewing right to food as only a three year \nproject to a view that it is an essential part of each partner\u2019s work in the long \nterm and that work continues even when the project ends. For this, we will \nfocus on trainings to build capacity, but also give partners practical \nexperience in doing studies, in campaigning and in lobbying. A preclude to \nsuch activity will be to actually do an assessment of where the partner is in \nterms of capacities and understanding of issues.\nOak Application Form     10\nAn important focus is also the use of instruments like litigation, studies and \npublications to bring about public focus on the rights to food and decent \nemployment.\nThe network is learning from its past experiences and incorporating the \nlearnings to the future strategies as and whenever required. For instance, \nthe network is focusing on capacity building of the young generation of the \ntarget communities and building them asset to the communities. Also, \ninclusion of partners and community members in conducting studies helps \nthe network to understand the depth of issue and to collect evidences of \nnegligence/loopholes at the implementation of the social schemes. These \ndocumentations support the campaign to file strong litigation to the court. \nThe network is going to emphasize on capacity building and inclusion of \ncommunities in these processes. The network will also emphasize on modular \ngroup formation as per capacity of the grassroot emerging leaders & existing \npartner organisations and link such groups on the existing groups at village \nlevel, at panchayat level, at Block level, at district level and to state level.", "6.

EdelGive is \ncurrently part of 6 big collaboratives in diverse domains; in critical capacities.\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nIndia is home to 1.4 billion people from diverse communities with each community \nhaving its own distinct challenges.  Despite Government intervention and policies \nover the years, there have been gaps in addressing community needs, leaving \nsome unaddressed and unheard.\nGrassroot organisation\u2019s role hence is fundamental to addressing social needs from \na microscopic lens. Although, India receives the highest foreign aid from across the \nworld, philanthropic efforts are unreachable/inequitably distributed towards the \nrural marginalized sections or urban poverty pockets within cities.\nHence, AFEF\u2019s mission was born out of this realization to support small and mid-\nsized organisations in India who understand the dynamic development dilemmas of \nthe communities, their immediate needs and provide sustainable solutions. AFEF \naims to fulfil this by focusing on:\n\u2022Education \u2013 With a belief that every child has the right to attend school and \nlearn in school, AFEF seek to address the systemic gaps that impact children\u2019s \naccess to quality education.\n\u2022Women Empowerment \u2013 Adopt a rights-based approach to support women \nin society, free them from violence and discrimination, build awareness and \naccessibility to their rights and entitlements, make them economically \nindependent and build grassroots leaders.\n\u2022Livelihoods \u2013 Work with vulnerable communities affected by unemployment, \nfailing agriculture and natural calamities through interventions targeted \ntowards building the resilience of the rural and tribal populations.\nAFEF will scope/invite proposals from organisations implementing critical \ninitiatives in India, and through a thorough due diligence process will award \ngrantees with AFEF\u2019s multi-year grants approach.

In India particularly, \nlockdowns have more deeply affected migrant and vulnerable communities who are \ngrappling with loss of income, livelihood, food, healthcare and resultant uncertainty \nand helplessness.\nGrassroot organisations have been at the forefront of addressing these problems but \nhave also become casualties themselves owing to extreme financial distress that is \nlikely to leave a lasting, negative impact outliving their capacities to mitigate them. \nStudies done during the COVID-19 period have reported that NGOs are facing lack \nof access to basic technology, salary cuts, lay-offs, inability to pay rent or source \nbasic supplies for daily sustenance are already prevailing issues.\nOf the 388 NGOs that responded to a Bridgespan survey on \u201cBuilding Strong, \nResilient NGOs in India: Time for New Funding Practices\u201d:\n\u202254% had less than 3 months of reserves in Sep\u201920, 50% NGOs never had an \noperating surplus\n\u202261% NGOs based in non-metro areas are worse off than in metros others \nwith less than 3 months of reserves\n\u202260% NGOs led by leaders from historically disadvantaged communities \n(DBA-Dalit, Bahujan Adivasi communities) have lower financial resilience \nwith less than 3 months of reserves, against 53% of non-DBA led NGOs.\nThe Impact of Covid-19 on India's Nonprofit Organisations report by CSIP based \non survey responses from close to 300 NGOs and 52 interviews reported the \nfollowing insights on challenges being faced:\n\u2022Operating in accordance with social distancing norms (61%)\n\u2022Dealing with financial insecurity (55%)\n\u2022Managing staff including remote work and ensuring staff well-being and \nsafety (70%).\n\u2022Burnout and exhaustion given that many NPOs worked at capacity and \nbeyond with limited staff strength\n\u2022Suspension of programs owing to discontinued funding and limited or \nabsent resource mobilisation capacity.\nGiven the above realities and facts, the possibility of breakdown of this cadre of \norganisations whom Foundations like AFEF rely on to deliver last-mile relief to \ncommunities, is worrisome.\nOpportunities:\nAs funders and grantmakers, AFEF and EdelGive deem it our responsibility to \nensure the grassroots sector sustains through:\n\u2022Recognition of grassroots work and of the risks that will be encountered if it \nwere to cease\n\u2022Acknowledgment of challenges that threaten to derail this work\n\u2022Readiness to arrive at urgent, practical and longer term solutions to address \nthese challenges\nAs proponents of collaborative rather than siloed approaches having experience of \nanchoring multiple Coalitions, we were among the first partners to join \nBridgespan\u2019s Pay What it Takes initiative which is committed to building stronger, \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\nmore financially resilient NGOs.

(maximum 300 \nwords):\nFPA India is currently implementing a 7 year Strategic Plan (2016-2022) focused \non Strengthening Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Services, Advocacy, \nGender, Empowerment, and Young People, and Organizational Efficiency. The \nStrategic Plan envisions all people empowered to enjoy their sexual and \nreproductive health choices and rights in an India free from stigma and \ndiscrimination.\nMission - A voluntary commitment to SRHR to advocate for and enable gender \nequality for all including the poor and vulnerable people, ensure information \neducation and services powered by knowledge, innovation, and technology \ntowards sustainable development.\nFPA India has deployed different models of programming to expand and deepen \nthe service delivery network, deliver and enable comprehensive sexuality \neducation to adolescents, implement inclusive and targeted interventions for the \nSRHR of key populations, address gender disparities and gender-based violence.\nSome of the recommended actions proposed during the mid-term review of the \nstrategic plan conducted in 2019, that have a bearing on the expansion plans \nproposed  under this project:\n1. Enable representation of FPA India in committees formulating block level and \ndistrict level action plans to contribute to the State PIPs, through as many \nBranches of FPA India as possible for creating a synergy between Youth, women \nempowerment, and health service delivery programme of FPA India and the \ncorresponding programmes and schemes implemented by the government bodies \nin those blocks and districts (Such as the RKSK, the RMNCH+A, MHM, AEP) \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\n2. Form consortia for identifying specific priorities (Such as \nAccess/Agency/Entitlements), building consensus, and driving collective action\n3. Focus on economic empowerment of women through entrepreneurial skill-\nbuilding\n4. Enable services through partner clinics \u2013Private and NGO facilities as well as \ngovernment health facilities to expand outreach\nDrivers of the Strategic Plan relevant to this project-\nThe unmet need for family planning and SRH services continues to be high. \nAccording to NFHS 4, the percentage of the Unmet Need for Family Planning \n(currently married women age 15\u201349 years) is found to be 12.9%. Of 37% of \ncontraceptive demand among adolescents (15-19 years) in India, only 15% have \nbeen met leading to 22% of unmet need (NFHS 4). The unmet need for spacing \nmethods is much higher (26%) among adolescents in India compared to the unmet \nneed for limiting (2.5%).[1]\nInequalities-gender & poverty continue to impact health and empowerment \noutcomes; Stigma and discrimination of age, marital status, class, gender, caste, \nsexuality other markers pose major challenges to the implementation of SRHR.\nAvailability of government schemes: a large number of schemes are currently \nbeing implemented by the government for young people, women, and vulnerable \ngroups related to health, livelihood and rights. These pose as opportunities for a \nstrong referral system and partnership building that can enable FPA India and its \nvarious associates including clients to avail the schemes thereby affecting long-\nterm SRHR outcomes.\nWide and varied provider base: There are a large number of registered, formal, \nand non-formal health care providers across the country. Opportunities exist in \npartnerships in integrating SRHR and in task shifting will ensure a wider pool of \nproviders at all levels.\n \n \n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nThe project attempts to address sexual and reproductive health and rights issues \nfaced by individuals and communities due to gender, age, caste, and \nsocioeconomic differentials.\nOur ongoing work in the operational areas of Kalchini and Kolkata has \ndemonstrated an increasing demand for comprehensive abortion care, family \nplanning, cervical cancer screening and management, maternal and child health \nservices, gender-based violence screening and continuum of care for survivors, \ncomprehensive sexuality education for adolescents and for some FGDs with key \nstakeholders conducted in 2017, regarding their perspectives on family planning. \nAdditionally, there is a report of an intervention in the Buxaduar area of \nKalchini that underscores the high need for SRH services for the high-need \nsatellite clinic intervention in Kalchini and Kolkata that needs to be sustained.\nAs per NFHS-4 data for India, the percentage of married women aged 15-49 years \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139\nwho use any modern contraceptive method stands at 47.8%. Of these, women in \nthe age group of 20-24 who were married before the age of 18 stand at 26.8%. \nAlso, women in the age group of 15-19 who were already mothers/pregnant before \n18 years is significantly high in the state of West Bengal (16.4%).\nData also shows that adolescents and youth have limited awareness about sexual \nand reproductive health matters. For instance, only 15% of young men and women \n(15\u201324 years) reported receiving any family life or sex education.\nHome to nearly 18% of the world\u2019s population, India also has the largest number \nof people living below the international poverty line of USD 1.90 a day. The socio-\neconomic disparities in India increased further during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nAround 140,000,000 (14 crores) Indians lost employment during the lockdown. \nMore than 45% of households across the nation reported an income drop as \ncompared to the previous year.\nSituated near Indo-Bhutan International Border, most people from the operational \narea of Kalchini are dependent on Tea Gardens. These tea garden workers are \ndeprived of their daily wages as per the government protocol. The health-seeking \nbehaviour among the Tea Garden workers is also found to be very low due to the \nlack of easily accessible health facilities in the villages of remote and forest areas.\n \nThe tea estates are located deep in the interiors with no Government or private \nhealth facilities available nearby. There is a lack of good means of transport and \nthe roads leading up to the tea estates/gardens are in a bad condition. This makes \nit even more difficult for healthcare professionals to get there to render health \nservices to the workers and families. An assessment of the needs of the tea garden \ncommunity during an intervention led by FPA India in Darjeeling district showed a \nhigh need for SRH and general health services. \nThe findings suggested a need for an integrated SRHR intervention for the health \nand well-being of tea garden workers and high demand from the community for \ncontinuation of the intervention, as they experience improved access to health \ncare and an improvement in their health-seeking behaviour.\nThe second wave of covid-19 has further exposed the potholes in the healthcare \nsystems. Given the restrictions on movement during the lockdown, people\u2019s ability \nto access health care services was severely impacted. Sexual and Reproductive \nhealthcare services, including maternal and child healthcare, safe abortion \nservices & Gender-based violence services were among the most severely \nimpacted, with the lack of access to ante-natal care & GBV care leading to a rise in \npreventable deaths. A surge in gender-based violence cases particularly domestic \nviolence showed the gendered nature of the pandemic and the need for sustained \nintervention.\n \nThe COVID - 19 pandemic has given an opportunity to FPA India to expand the \nservice coverage in Kalchni and Kolkata by engaging government and private \nplayers to utilize and explore the digital health solutions into practice & build \ninfrastructure capacities to facilitate telemedicine & teleconsultation models to \naddress the SRH needs of communities, without fragmenting the existing \nlandscapes of service delivery of care.\n \nFPA India Kalchini Branch covers a population of more than 10 lakhs across \nKalchini and Madarihaat blocks and Madarihaat municipality. Besides serving a \nlarge population of tea garden workers and their families, the branch reaches out \nto the most vulnerable and marginalized groups that include female sex workers at \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201310\nJaigaon (Indo Bhutan Border) and Alipurduar, Persons Living with HIV AIDs \n(PLWHA) in Alipurduar. The Branch is also associated with 380 CBOs, SHGs and \nyouth groups that can be mobilized for community-based interventions. In recent \nmonths, the Branch has also started conducting Rapid Antigen tests for COVID-19 \nfor all clients with symptoms/history of exposure who visit the clinic for non-\nCOVID essential SRH services. The local district authorities rely on the FPAI team \nin Kalchini to deliver last-mile contraceptive supplies and immunization services to \nneedy populations in hilly terrains where there are no motorable roads or \ngovernment health facilities.\n \nFPA India Kolkata Branch covers (Urban, peri-urban, rural and slum-based \npopulations of more than 18 lakh, in Howrah, Hooghly, and North & South 24 \nParaganas. The Branch has initiated interventions in the high need areas of \nCanning, Kultoli, Shason, Bhangor, Shamnagar, Icchapur, Champdani, \nShreerampur, Watgunge, Tollygunge, Raidighi, Songachi, Sheoraphuli, reaching \nout to the most vulnerable communities including female Sex workers, \ntransgenders, men having sex with men (MSMs), Injecting Drug Users, migrants \nand the elderly. A network of 47 Self Help Groups, 60 Youth Groups and 6 CBOs \nwork closely with the Branch, to enable community-based interventions.\n \nThus FPAI has been continually responsive to the community needs as well as the \nrequests from health authorities to bridge the gaps in the SRH services, leading to \nan organic evolution of the programme from a family planning intervention in the \nearly years to a more comprehensive SRH programme.\nWith support from Oak, FPA India will be able to conduct capacity building and \nadvocacy interventions to energize the public health system and build community \nnetworks of vulnerable groups for sustained demand generation. Thus, the \nintervention will bring about a transformational change in the community, from \nbeing \u2018beneficiaries\u2019 of the programmes to stakeholders in the process of \ndevelopment. FPAI will also invest in partnerships such as with Ipas, to make \ninroads into newer geographies, for example, in the Sundarbans\nFPAI will expand focused SRH work in the high need Sundarbans areas through \nthe FPAI Kolkata branch, specifically in Kultali, Hingalganj, Canning, Gadkhali, \nBasanti and Gosaba in south 24 parganas.

The initial years of ECS were invested in \nspreading climate consciousness across educational institutions. Between \n2010 and 2017, ECS spun off 3 social enterprises respectively to take \ndecentralized energy solutions to the underserved, to address unsustainable \nagriculture through an alternative ecosystem around organic agriculture, and \nto incubate Green Entrepreneurs.\nECS\u2019s current outreach is to over 5560 villages and urban agglomerations \nacross nine states in India, ranging from Maharashtra in the west to Manipur \nin the east. One of the major projects in early days was on \u201cCapacity Building \nfor Sustainable Access to Clean Energy in Eastern India\u201d. Since then, ECS has \nimplemented 57 projects, with average duration of 18.75 months and average \nvalue of 7.8 million INR. This includes promotion of 60 FPOs within last few \nyears. 50% of these FPOs are 15-26 months old, having average cumulative \nturnover of INR 19,64,786 and average annual turnover of INR 9,81,630 per \nFPO.\nImpact assessment of our program on Solar pump in Jharkhand revealed that \n79% of Solar Pump beneficiaries enhanced their agricultural productions \nwhereas 65% stopped using diesel pumps. In Chattisgarh, 65% beneficiaries \nenhanced their income through efficient irrigation systems.\nECS received \u201cPacesetter Award\u201d in 2016 by MNRE to encourage investment \nin off-grid clean energy development, and ICC Social Impact Award in 2020 \nin the area of Clean Energy.

If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nThe key issues faced by the small tea growers of northern West Bengal include \nagro-technical problems (pest and insect attacks), lack of technical knowledge \n(early identification of plant diseases/pest attacks and their control measures), \nlack of irrigation facilities and associated dependency on fossil fuel to operate \nagri-machineries, lack of credit facilities. These reasons are leading to a higher \ncost of producing tea @INR 20 per Kg whereas the market is paying a price of \nINR 15-18 per kg, making it unsustainable. On the other hand, major \nchallenges faced by tea garden workers in the region include low wages, poor \nworking conditions, lack of land rights and housing, limited access to \neducation and healthcare, seasonal unemployment, and exploitation and \ninequality. The proposed project aims to address these challenges and improve \nwell-being of communities in 3 tea gardens and 2500 small tea growers across \nin Jalpaiguri, Kalimpong and Darjeeling districts in the following ways:\nOak Application Form     7\n\u2022Limited access to clean cooking solutions: The project aims to promote \nthe adoption of sustainable and clean energy sources and appliances to \nreduce the community's reliance on firewood. This will help conserve \nforests, protect wildlife habitats, mitigate climate change effects, and \nimprove community's health.\n \n\u2022Inadequate lighting and electricity access: The project at one hand will \nfocus on providing lighting in public spaces to enhance the security of \nwomen and children, and on the other hand will extend study hours, \nenable the utilization of smart devices, and enhance educational \ndevelopment for children in the community by ensuring energy access \nat household level.\n \n\u2022Lack of energy for clean water access: The project will implement \nrenewable energy based solutions for clean water access towards \nreducing the prevalence of waterborne diseases, and improving overall \nhealth and well-being, and ensuring irrigation.\n \n\u2022Limited access to energy for livelihood activities: While in one hand the \nproject willensure exposure, resource linkage and access to renewable \nenergy based solutions to address agro-technical problems faced by the \nsmall tea growers, on the other hand it will promote diverse livelihood \noptions beyond the tea industry focusing on the tea garden workers.\nOur approach to solve the aforementioned problems would involve a four-\npronged strategy: conducting research for needs assessment, identification \nand sourcing of appropriate technologies, skill and capacity building around \ntechnology and process, and establishing an ecosystem that connects \nstakeholders across the value chain. We aim to empower these communities \nby promoting their self-reliance through access to financial resources, \nmarkets, and government schemes. Technology and innovation will drive \nsustainability, and a comprehensive research framework will inform evidence-\nbased decision-making and policy.\nOak's funding will be utilized through a comprehensive approach, including \nneeds assessments in terms of energy requirement, market study/scoping \nstudy to identify appropriate technology solutions, study on potential of green \njobs within and outside intervention area, capacity and skill development of \ncommunity around tailored livelihood avenues and associated energy \ntechnologies, handholding support for community engagement across value \nchains through livelihood support centre, establishing resource linkages for \nrenewable energy  driven infrastructure development, promoting community \ninstitution through technology and buyer expo for scale and market linkage, \nmonitoring and evaluation, informing policy, and ensuring sustainability and \nreplicability. It will also contribute to establishing partnerships, documenting \nbest practices, and enable the replication of successful models.\nIdentification of the problems and determination of our approach was \nbased on consultation, research, and experience-based learning. We \nconducted situational analysis with tea-garden communities in Kalimpong \n(West Bengal), consulted institutions like local FPOs, Tea Board and The \nOak Application Form     8\nConfederation of Indian Small Tea Growers Associations (Cista).

The lack of an ecosystem for promotion of Distributed renewable energy \nsolutions and the significance of awareness & capacity building of key \nstakeholders to address resource depletion and environmental \nchallenges.\n2. The importance of engaging grassroots civil society organizations which \nleads to amplification of the impact and reach of initiatives.\n3. Adoption of the nexus approach between energy, water, and agriculture \nyields multidimensional benefits for both the environment and rural \ncommunities.\n4. Women as key stakeholders in natural resource management empowers \nthem and leads to robust and sustainable outcomes.\n5. Building strategic partnerships with state nodal agencies, banks, and \nfinancial institutions leads to efficient project implementation and \nfacilitates better access to financing & resources.\n6. Capacity building through training programs and knowledge \ndissemination strengthens the skills and expertise of stakeholders, \nparticularly youth and rural women.\n7. Leveraging digital platforms, such as Learning Management Systems, \ncreates active knowledge banks and expands the reach of educational \nresources to the communities at large..\n8. Promoting collective action and formalizing networks fosters \ncollaboration and resource sharing among organizations working \ntowards similar goals.\nOak Application Form     16\n9. Implementing climate-resilient agricultural practices and fostering \ninnovations improves adaptation and resilience of disadvantaged \ncommunities in the face of climate change.\nDrawing from these learnings, ecosystem approach has been a by-default \naspect of any project involving rural communities. Also, in our recent program \nregarding monitoring of groundwater and its recharge through watershed \nplanning, rural women have been central players right from periodic \ngroundwater monitoring. These successful approaches will guide the current \nproject in achieving its objectives and maximizing its impact on just energy \ntransition and sustainable resource management.\n3.If cap-ex for technology products is to be sourced from schemes, why \nis the budget component so high? There has to be a clear rationale on \nthe budget.\nThis is primarily due to the lack of an existing ecosystem that should \nencompass interlinkages between Technology, Scheme, Finance, Production \nChain, and Market, which would be crucial for ensuring effective energy \naccess and livelihood enhancement for the small tea growers and tea garden \nworkers..\nTo establish this essential ecosystem, it is necessary to engage a group of \nprofessionals who possess the expertise and experience in bridging the gaps \nbetween various stakeholders. These professionals will play a vital role in \nidentifying suitable technology solutions, coordinating with relevant schemes \nfor capital expenditure, establishing financial mechanisms, facilitating \nproduction chain integration, and creating market linkages. Cost covered for \ntraining and capacity building is a little less than half of the proposed grant. \nAlso, extensive research during the first 6 months of the project and \ndemonstration of DRE applications during the first two years of the project will \nrequire significant program expenditure.\nWe believe that investing in the establishment of this ecosystem is essential to \novercome the existing barriers and challenges faced by the these communities. \nBy doing so, we can create a solid foundation for future projects, streamline \nthe implementation of renewable technologies, and effectively leverage \navailable schemes for capital expenditure on technology products.\nThe estimated budget for the proposed project is USD 160 per beneficiary \nfamily. Out of this USD 107 per family is being sought from OAK Foundation. \nOut of this, an estimated cost for the whole package of training would be USD \n42 per family during the tenure of the project. The cost for all 6 researches \nwould be USD 6 per family. Developing ecosystem (Stakeholder meeting, \nbuyer-seller meet, producer expo) would cost USD 11 per family. Maintaining \nMIS throughout the project period would cost USD 4 per family. A team of 9 \nfull-time staffs (Capacity Building Manager, Communication Manager, \nLivelihood Expert, Energy Expert and 5 Tea-Garden Coordinators) would be \ninvolved right from inception till the completion of the project for handholding \nsupport to community throughout the journey. Individuals in this team will be \npaid a monthly average salary of USD 455 (Range of USD 377-566). Total cost \nto this team would be  USD 39 per family throughout the project period.\n4.What are the possibilities of enhancing the committed co-financing \nfrom the present USD 50,000?\nOak Application Form     17\nCurrently, we have secured a core grant of USD 50,000 from MacArthur \nFoundation. These commitments have been instrumental in enabling us to \ninitiate the project and lay the foundation for its success.\nAfter careful consideration and exploring potential avenues, we have identified \nthe possibility of enhancing the committed co-financing up to a maximum of \nUSD 84,000.\n5.The solar cookstoves model has not been so successful till date. What \nare the strategies to be adopted towards mitigating this risk. What \nlearnings can you factor in from other models implemented elsewhere. \nPlease undertake a secondary research on the same.\nIn Guatemala, the Solar Household Energy project effectively increased the \nadoption of solar cookstoves by providing tailored training, addressing cultural \npreferences, and ensuring affordability (Source: https://www.she-inc.org/). \nSimilarly, in India, the Solar Cooking Project successfully promoted solar \ncookstoves by involving local communities in the design and promotion \nprocess, emphasizing health and environmental benefits, and facilitating \naccess to finance (Source: https://www.solarcookers.org/work). For instance, \nBarli Institute has been successfully experimenting with solar cookers for over \n22 years in Madhya Pradesh.  Since 1998 the Institute has developed its \nkitchen tailored to solar cooking, and has installed 3 large Scheffler parabolic \ncookers in this kitchen. It has an ongoing program on \u201csolar cooking and food \nprocessing\u201d where the institute prepares all its meals for 130 persons per day \nwith solar cookers (for about 300 solar days a year), saving up to 12 cylinders \nof cooking gas (equivalent to about 900 kilograms of wood) each month. This \nprogram helps women to escape the daily, back-breaking work of fuel \ngathering, and preserve forest and woodlands and reduce air pollution. The \ninstitute provides training in maintenance of SK-14 & Prince-15 parabolic \ndomestic solar cookers. The ex-trainees also introduce and demonstrate the \nbenefits of solar cooking to their neighboring communities.\n(https://www.barli.org/english-brochure.html)\nApplied Science and Engineering was founded by Dr. Srinivasa Ravuri from \nSecunderabad in Telangana. Srinivasa created this organization to pursue \nresearch, design, and promotion of solar-thermal implements that can be used \nfor cooking, heating, food drying, and for water desalination. The organization \nhas been involved with solar cooking since 2008. By 2016 they had distributed \n50 solar cookers and had taught over 200 people to solar cook with solar box \ncookers, parabolic cookers, and solar food dryers.\n(https://solarcooking.fandom.com/wiki/Applied_Science_and_Engineering)\nWe don\u2019t have a mandated agenda to promote Solar Cooker in the intervention \narea. The approach would be to first test the technical feasibility of Solar \nCooker in the region. Upon successful trial, we can set up pilot projects and \ndemonstration centers in collaboration with local partners and organizations. \nThis can include community meetings, demonstrations, and interactive \nsessions to address any misconceptions or skepticism. These initiatives can \nshowcase the effectiveness of solar cookers, allowing community members to \nsee the benefits firsthand and gain confidence in the technology. Our recent \nfact finding visit in Kalimpong shows that more and more households in the \ntea-garden communities are getting LPG gas connection and reducing \ndependence on firewood. However, considering the costs involved in LPG gas \nOak Application Form     18\nconnection, sharing the burden with Solar cook-stove in a hybrid mode would \nsurely prove to be a cost-cutting model.\n6.There should be a clear market study/scoping study on available \ntechnological equipment (supply chain, maintenance, costs) and a \nstudy of the green jobs and entrepreneurship potential in the region. \nThis should inform the training interventions for the youth and identify \nthe sectors, businesses (locally and regionally) for placement of these \nyouth. What are the types of entrepreneurship avenues possible related \nto renewables in the region?\nThe market and scoping study will comprehensively analyze the existing \ntechnological equipment relevant to renewable energy solutions, including \ntheir supply chain, maintenance requirements, and costs. Additionally, the \nstudy will assess the green jobs and entrepreneurship potential in the region, \nidentifying sectors and businesses suitable for youth placement. It will also \nexplore various entrepreneurship avenues related to renewables. The study \nwill gather data through surveys, interviews, and field visits, assessing market \ndemand, local needs, and potential for sustainable businesses. Findings will \ninform targeted training interventions for youth and guide the development of \na robust ecosystem for renewable energy adoption and entrepreneurship in \nthe region. A few important aspects to be covered are as follows -\nTechnology Assessment: The study will assess the availability, suitability, and \ncost-effectiveness of renewable energy technologies in the market. This \nincludes solar cook stoves, solar pumps, and other DRE appliances.\nGreen Jobs and Entrepreneurship Potential: It will identify potential sectors \nwith growth opportunities for green jobs and entrepreneurship, considering \nthe region's ecological and socio-economic context.\nTraining Needs Analysis: The study will analyze the skill gaps and training \nrequirements for youth to actively engage in the renewable energy sector and \ngreen job opportunities.\nLocal and Regional Business Identification: It will identify and assess local and \nregional businesses that align with renewable energy solutions and green \npractices, offering placement opportunities for trained youth.\nPolicy and Regulatory Analysis: The study will analyze existing policies and \nregulations related to renewable energy and identify opportunities and \nchallenges for entrepreneurship.\nThe study's outcomes will be instrumental in guiding the project's \ninterventions and ensuring that youth are equipped with the necessary skills \nand knowledge to thrive in the growing renewable energy market while \nfostering entrepreneurship and sustainable practices in the region.\n7.SwitchON should consider narrowing down of the programme just \nfocusing on meeting the energy needs (electricity, water, cooking fuel, \nlighting). The strategy for broadening the set of interventions should \nbe well thought of and selective (youth training and employment, \nentrepreneurship, alternative livelihoods).\nWhile we understand the importance of selectivity and a well-thought-out \nstrategy, we also recognize the need for a comprehensive approach to address \nthe multifaceted challenges faced by the small tea growers and tea garden \nworkers. By providing a basket of decentralized renewable energy (DRE) \nOak Application Form     19\nsolutions, there is opportunity to address the immediate energy needs of the \ntarget community while also promoting alternative livelihood opportunities. \nBased on the terrain of tea-garden and availability of land, a few \nenvironmentally compatible value chain options could be Eco-tourism and \nHospitality (homestays, cultural experiences), Small scale organic farming \n(Spices, Herbs etc.), Beekeeping and Honey Production, Dairy and Livestock \nFarming, Making of Sal-Leaf plates, Mushroom Cultivation, Horticulture (fruit-\nbearing trees, mushroom, medicinal plants, herbal plants). However, choosing \nthe combination of suitable livelihood would depend on a number of factors \nincluding availability of spare land, access to forest, marketability etc. \nWe acknowledge the importance of thoughtful selection and prioritization of \ninterventions based on local context, market demand, and community needs. \nOur team will conduct thorough assessments and engage in dialogue with the \ncommunities in 3 tea gardens and small tea growers across in Jalpaiguri, \nKalimpong and Darjeeling districts to identify the most relevant and impactful \ninterventions. While the central focus would be to help 2500 small tea growers \nand tea garden workers (3 tea gardens) meet the energy needs, the resources \nwill also be invested in making the community aware of the scopes and \npossibilities around alternate sustainable livelihood option in an ecosystem \napproach to enhance their resilience to future challenges. Also among targeted \n5000 families (including both tea garden workers and small tea growers), there \nwould always be a few risk-takers who would come forward to learn and adapt \nnew livelihood avenues in small scale with assured market. Their success will \nbe the living demonstrations to boost the courage of a few others to come \nforward.\nA recent feasibility study conducted in northeast India's tea estates, a major \ntea-growing region, found a significant opportunity for adopting renewable \nenergy systems. The study surveyed eight tea gardens (four from Assam and \nfour from West Bengal) and seven tea processing industries. It revealed that \ntea gardens believe that installing large solar panels would not affect tea plant \ngrowth. Solar energy was preferred over other alternatives due to lower costs \nand easier installation. Most tea gardens (87.5%) have unused or barren land \nsuitable for solar panel installation, while a few (12.5%) do not.\n(https://krishi.icar.gov.in/jspui/bitstream/123456789/71187/1/Feasibilitystudy\nonrenewableenergysysteminteaCamelliasinensis.pdf)\n(https://india.mongabay.com/2022/02/assam-tea-gardens-experiment-with-\nsolar-for-reliable-power-supply-and-cutting-costs-emissions/)\n8.What about the geography? Kalimpong exclusively or layering on \nother tea gardens across the tea garden region.\nEnvironment Conservation Society has no pressing agenda of sticking to \nKalimpong as project area. Strategically, it would rather be fruitful to extend \nthis project to areas with prior presence of Oak Foundation and it\u2019s partners. \nIt is assumed that the prior rapport with communities in such area would \nensure an initial thrust during the inception of the project. However, alongside \nKalimpong, we\u2019re targeting Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling to bring under the \npurview of the project. .\n9.Rationale behind initial 6 months of research\nThe project shall be undertaking 4 initial researches within the first 6 months. \nThey include Baseline Study on Program Indicators, Need Assessment on \nOak Application Form     20\nEnergy Requirements in Tea Garden, Scoping study on the potential of \nlivelihood enhancement of small tea growers as well as diversified livelihood \noptions for tea garden workers, and Market study to identify appropriate \ntechnology solutions. Each of these studies (except the last one) would involve \nsurvey with around 1000 Households. We are allotting 45 days (effective 37 \nworking days) for each of these studies. This would involve finalizing research \nmethodology, research tools, training of enumerators, data tabulation, data \ncleaning, data analysis, draft report, internal peer review and final report. We \nwould insist that same group of researcher would be conducting all four \nresearches to ensure interconnectivity in research findings and same standard \nin all four knowledge products. Thus, research would be conducted one after \nanother and would require 6 months.\n10.What are the possible DRE technologies that can be adopted in this \nproject\nSolar Power Systems: Installation of solar panels for generating electricity and \nmeeting energy needs in tea gardens and associated facilities.\nBiogas Systems: Implementation of biogas plants to convert organic waste \nfrom tea gardens and livestock farming into biogas for cooking and heating \npurposes.\nImproved Cookstoves: Introducing energy-efficient cookstoves to reduce fuel \nconsumption and indoor air pollution.\nSolar Water Heaters: Deploying solar water heating systems to provide hot \nwater for various needs, such as bathing and kitchen use.\nSolar Dryers: Utilizing solar energy to power drying systems for tea leaves, \nspices, and herbs, enhancing the efficiency and quality of the drying process.\nSolar Water Pumps: Installing solar-powered water pumps for drinking/small \nirrigation purposes, reducing reliance on grid electricity or diesel pumps.\nSolar Power Sprayers: This Is to support the existing agro-technical need of \nthe small tea growers.\nEnergy-Efficient Lighting: Promoting the use of energy-efficient LED lighting \nsystems in tea garden households and community spaces.\nPart B: \n1.Which are the financing schemes (central/state) that can be \nharnessed for this proposed project and what are the modalities for \ndoing so? Since this is the tea garden community with the only identity \nof being \u201clabourers\u201d, their eligibility for these schemes should be \nconsidered carefully.\nApplicable for Small Tea Growers -\nMajor Central Schemes/Agencies - Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), \nSwarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY), Tea Development & Promotion \nScheme, Tea Board of India.\nMajor State Schemes/Agencies - Financial Support Scheme for Farm \nMechanization (FSSM), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchay Yojna (PMKSY), \nMIssion For Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), West Bengal \nState Rural Livelihoods Mission (WBSRLM)-Anandadhara, Bangla Swanirbhar \nKarmasansthan Prakalpa (BSKP), West Bengal Swanirbhar Sahayak Prakalpa, \nKarmo Bhumi Prakalpa, Yuvashree Arpan Scheme\nOak Application Form     21\nApplicable for Tea Garden Workers -\nMajor Central Schemes/Agencies - Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), \nSwarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY), Tea Development & Promotion \nScheme\nMajor State Schemes/Agencies - West Bengal Swanirbhar Sahayak Prakalpa, \nKarmo Bhumi Prakalpa, Yuvashree Arpan Scheme, Chaai Sundari Scheme. \nSamajik Surakshya Yojana \nTo harness the mentioned financial schemes, the modalities can include \nidentifying eligible beneficiaries, conducting training programs, facilitating \nloan applications, collaborating with relevant government departments, and \nproviding guidance on accessing the benefits.\n2.How the proposed programme can be positioned for generating \ntraction with the administration and philanthropic sector as a pathway \nfor improved living conditions, economic opportunities and climate \nadaptation? What are the opportunities?\nThe proposed programme can be positioned as a comprehensive solution with \nfollowing opportunities -\n\u2022Highlighting the alignment of the programme with government priorities \nand policies related to poverty alleviation, rural development, and \nclimate change mitigation. A few such policies are mentioned below-\n1.Policy Framework for developing and promoting Decentralized \nRenewable Energy (DRE) Livelihood Applications in Rural Areas\n2.Policy on Co-generation and Generation of Electricity from Renewable \nSources of Energy.\n3.State Climate Change Action Plan (SCCAP)\n4.West Bengal Startup Policy\n\u2022Demonstrating the potential for positive socio-economic impacts through \ncase studies, success stories, and data on livelihood improvements, \nincome generation, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.\n\u2022Engaging with relevant government departments, local authorities, and \nphilanthropic organizations through presentations, workshops, and \nstakeholder consultations to build partnerships and garner support.\n\u2022Showcasing the programme's potential for scalability and replication, \nemphasizing the long-term benefits and sustainability of the proposed \ninterventions.\n3.Secondary information on the green jobs sector in West Bengal and \nelsewhere in India? Are there any strategic tie-ups with companies \nwhich produce these clean energy solutions for placement of youth?\nThe renewable energy sector in India has witnessed significant growth, driven \nby government policies and initiatives like the National Solar Mission. Solar \npower has emerged as a major contributor to green job creation, with \nopportunities in solar panel manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. \nAlso, National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is being implemented in seven \nnon-attainment cities in West Bengal. NCAP 2.0 is likely to create between \n20,000 and 40,000 green jobs in West Bengal alone, opined experts at the India \nClean Air Summit 2022 (ICAS 2022). As per a senior professor of IIT Kanpur, \nOak Application Form     22\nan estimated 1 million green jobs are available within the air quality domain \nalone across India. Overall, India has the potential to create 35 million green \njobs by the year 2047 in renewable energy, waste management, electric \nvehicles, green construction, and sustainable textiles in urban and peri-urban \nareas, according to a study launched by Skill Council for Green Jobs and Sattva \nConsulting and supported by J.P. Morgan\n(https://www.millenniumpost.in/kolkata/bengal-to-create-20k-to-40k-green-\njobs-in-next-few-years-490996?infinitescroll=1)\n(http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/100318337.cms?from=mdr&\nutm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst)\nOn the other hand, The central government's focus on electric mobility has led \nto the emergence of green jobs in electric vehicle manufacturing, charging \ninfrastructure development, and battery technology. Government initiatives \nlike the Skill India Mission and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy's \nskill development programs aim to bridge the skill gap and create a pool of \ntrained professionals for the green sector. Additionally, programs like the \nGreen Skill Development Programme (GSDP) provide training and certification \nin specific green job roles. According to available data, entry-level technicians \nin renewable energy sectors can earn an average salary ranging from INR \n15,000 to INR 30,000 per month. With experience and specialization, the \nsalary range can increase. The government's commitment to renewable energy \nand sustainable development, coupled with global efforts to combat climate \nchange, will continue to drive demand for skilled workers in green industries. \nMission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) is an indicator towards the same.\nIndia\u2019s solar and wind energy sectors employed 1,64,000 workers as of FY\u201922, \nshowing a 47% increase from FY\u201921. 84% of this workforce is in the solar \nenergy sector.. Solar energy alone accounted for the largest share of green \njobs in India, employing over 120,000 people in various roles such as \nmanufacturing, installation, and maintenance. By 2030, it is projected that the \nEV sector in India will create around 10 million jobs across the value chain, \nincluding manufacturing, assembly, battery production, and charging \ninfrastructure.\nAs per a very recent \u201cBusiness Standard\u201d article this month, a study conducted \nby NLB Services claim that demand for green jobs in India is projected to grow \nat a rate of 15-20% annually over the next decade. This growth trajectory \nsuggests that India has the potential to create 30-32 million green jobs by \n2050. The increasing demand for green jobs is primarily motivated by India's \nambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070.

As result of \nour efforts, there was greater enforcement of child labour laws, which \nled to a 70% increase in the number of children rescued from child \nlabour, and 15 convictions over four years \u2013 an unprecedented \nachievement, and a significant deterrent for traffickers.\n\u2022Our Prevention Model implemented in West Bengal has demonstrated \nimpact in mitigating trafficking. We observed increased participation \nof young people and families - 4,000 young people in collectives, 1,091 \nactive Community-based Institutions (CBIs); improved capacity among \nCBIs to support vulnerable children - 43% of child protection cases and \n73% of at-risk cases of trafficking were resolved by CBIs; and improved \nliving conditions through access to entitlements - 82% of beneficiaries \npeople who applied for job cards saw an increase in monthly income.\n\u2022Through our work with the Jharkhand Anti-Trafficking Network, a \ncoalition of 13 organisations, we have reached out to over 20,000 \ncommunity members to promote safe migration and prevent \ntrafficking.\nWe have also recently launched a strategic partnership with the Children\u2019s \nInvestment Fund Foundation to develop an ambitious Child Protection \nProgramme, which will leverage significant support to strengthen the child \nprotection ecosystem in India and reduce exploitation of children by 30%.\n5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? \nHow will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and \ndecide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nEvidence suggests that the tea garden districts of northern West Bengal are \nlikely source and transit points along the migration and trafficking corridor. \nAlipurduar, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling districts in particular, share porous \nborders with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh, and with north-east India, \nmaking them likely hubs for trafficking and unsafe migration.\nThere are nearly 250 tea gardens across the three districts employing over 2.2 \nlakh workers, around 10% of which have been declared sick or shut down. Tea \ngarden workers have been systemically exploited, often denied the minimum \nOak Application Form     7\nwage or entitlements such as provident fund and gratuity. Debt is offered in \nadvance and offset against wages, trapping them in a vicious cycle. Child \nlabour is rampant with many children being employed at 50% of the minimum \nwage for adults in peak season. Poverty, illiteracy, school dropouts, \nunemployment, under-employment, exploitation of workers (low wages, \nunpaid wages and benefits) are issues that are commonly seen. Poor \nimplementation of social protection schemes further marginalises and \ndisenfranchises them. As a result, the region witnesses high rates of out-\nmigration, including that of young people to faraway destinations without the \nknowledge or support of their families, making them vulnerable to trafficking \nand exploitation. Between 1992 and 2015, over 2.5 lakh people migrated out \nof tea gardens.\nWithin the state, 21.43% of the population is multi-dimensionally poor. The \nCOVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the crisis, with many families \ndeprioritising health, nutrition, and education. The Annual State of \nEducation Report for West Bengal 2021 estimates that 3.5% of children aged \n15 to 16 years have either dropped out of school or never been enrolled. The \nNational Family Health Survey V also paints a sordid picture on the health \nand nutritional indicators for children, and points to a prevalence of early \nmarriage and gender-based violence. From 2016-2020, 8,000 children were \nreported missing from the state every year, and children account for 75% of \ncases of victims trafficked and victims rescued in 2020. CHILDLINE data \nalso points to a high number of trafficking cases \u2013 23% of cases in 2019-20 \nwere reported from West Bengal. Due to the recent division of districts, child \nprotection structures such as Child Welfare Committees, Anti-Human \nTrafficking Units, shelter homes etc. are inadequate. Grassroots structures \nsuch as Village-level Child Protection Committees are inactive as well. With \ntea gardens being privately managed and far from the district headquarters, \nit is also challenging for stakeholders to make inroads with the community \nfor monitoring and vigilance. \nBAT in partnership with The Hummingbird Foundation has developed a \nPrevention of Trafficking Model that has demonstrated impact in mitigating \ntrafficking in West Bengal. The premise is that collective action by key \nstakeholders\u2013young people, parents, community-based institutions and local \ngovernment\u2013leads to transformative community action and ultimately \n'systems change\u2019 to reduce the risk of trafficking. We believe that this model, \nwith certain adaptations, can also serve to reduce the vulnerabilities that \nlead to unsafe migration.\nWe seek to roll out an integrated programme in Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and \nDarjeeling districts (selected after gathering secondary data and inputs from \norganisations, researchers and government stakeholders working in the \nregion), that draws together children (6 to 18 years), young people (18 to 24 \nyears), families, community-based institutions such as Self Help Groups, \nchildren and youth groups, School Management Communities, Tea Garden \nAssociations, migrant workers and state actors; builds their capacity to take \ncollective action; and bridges the gaps in convergence between stakeholders. \nWe will engage with 3 lakh community members, including 1.2 lakh children \nacross 8 blocks in 3 districts, and will leverage on their local knowledge and \nstrengths to design interventions that are best suited to the local context. We \nwill convene a safe migration and counter trafficking network of \nimplementing partners and resource organisations who hold strong \nOak Application Form     8\ncommunity linkages and knowledge at different levels (panchayat, block and \ndistrict), collaboratively working towards a common goal of mitigating \ntrafficking and unsafe migration. Key interventions that are planned include \ncommunity mobilisation; awareness generation; collectivisation and \nstrengthening of grassroots child protection structures; empowerment of \nchildren and young people; facilitating linkages to entitlements; vocational \ntraining; and capacity building, engagement and advocacy with ecosystem \nstakeholders and government systems.  \nThe recent notifications issued by the Ministry of Women and Child \nDevelopment on the Mission Vatsalya Implementation Guidelines, and by the \nWest Bengal Government on the Modified Guidelines for Child Protection \nCommittees in West Bengal, also serve as proof that the conditions are \nfavourable to work with grassroots structures. Additionally, one of the \nselected implementing partners, CINI, has been appointed by the West \nBengal government as one of the nodal agencies responsible for \nimplementing the modified guidelines.", "6.

The implementing partners have been selected based \non their track record of working on issues on child protection and safe \nmigration in the region, at different levels of governance (panchayat, block \nand district). Our selected partners have extensive expertise across a broad \nrange of issues, including social protection, livelihoods and behaviour change, \nwhich will add value to the project. BAT will regularly convene our \nimplementing partners and government stakeholders, to facilitate knowledge \nexchange and ensure that inputs from the grassroots are fed upwards to policy \nmakers.\nBAT is committed to a bottom-up approach to all our programmes, to ensure \nthat communities we serve have a voice in programme design. BAT\u2019s partners \nwill meet with communities on a regular basis, so that we can receive feedback \nand alter our approach as needed. We will establish a community-led safety \nnet and build capacities of children and communities to empower them to take \nownership of issues that affect them and hold state actors accountable, so that \nbeneficiaries receive their entitlements.\nGiven BAT\u2019s partnership with the Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation \n(CIFF), a grant from the Oak Foundation is likely to be matched 1:1 by CIFF. \nThe matched funding will allow BAT to layer on complementary interventions \nthat will add significant depth and scale to the activities supported by the \nOak Foundation, thus achieving greater impact.", "9.

If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nThe Problem: AIF along with BBC partners intends to address the problem \nof Low Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) in Rural India: \nAt a policy level, Ministries such as Women and Child Development have \nschemes like E-Haat, Rashtriya Mahila Kosh and Swayam Siddha Kosh project \namong others made a sincere effort to encourage women entrepreneurship. \nHowever, despite the positive conversations and concrete steps being taken \naround the issue, it has unfortunately not translated into a conducive \nentrepreneurship ecosystem for women. There are a multitude of barriers \nthat are a hindrance to the social progress of women as entrepreneurs. These \ninclude but are not limited to the inherent bias against women\u2019s business \nskills, conventional gender roles rooted in patriarchal mindsets, and lack of \naccess to finance and networks, among others. Refer detailed research report \nin the attachment. Deeply embedded gender norms among other sociocultural \nissues deprive women of access to information, market knowledge, finance, \nand most importantly, paid employment.\nAccording to a 2019 report by Google and Bain & Company, women were \nalready worst hit by India\u2019s unemployment crisis. While the overall Indian \nunemployment rate was at 7 percent before India\u2019s March 2020 lockdown, it \nwas already as high as 18 percent for women. Post the devastating impact of \nthe COVID 19 on India\u2019s economy and the widening job crises, the FLFPR of \nIndia dropped to a historic low of 16.1% during the July-September 2020 \nquarter, the lowest among the major economies. In 2021, as the COVID \npandemic hit jobs and the economy, less than 16.1% of Indian women were \npart of the country\u2019s labour force (Reuters, 2021). This is among the lowest \nrates of women\u2019s workforce participation in the world. Today, only Yemen, \nIraq, Jordan, Syria, Algeria, Iran, and the West Bank and Gaza have lower \nFLFPR than India.\nRationale for Formative Phase: BBC partners entered into the formative \nphase with a hypothesis that the micro, small, medium enterprise (MSME) \nOak Application Form     8\nsector can play a significant role in accelerating rural women's \nentrepreneurship, such that they can leverage digital and climate-resilient \ntechnologies, access government schemes and provisions and lead inclusive \nvalue chains to demonstrate an increase in FLFPR. To do so, BBC partners\u2019 \nmain objective were to learn following broader aspects to design gender-\nsensitive programs via addressing following informational gaps:\n\u2022Identification of key enabling factors for the ecosystem to address \nsystemic challenges, BBC partners will identify opportunities through \nresearch findings and strengthen networks for accelerating growth of \nmid-high impact, mid-high potential RWE.\n\u2022Approaches to strengthen and identification of best models to scale-up \nfor viable and potential RWE and micro-enterprises. We intended to \nlearn how and where in the value chain we can transform the lives of \nwomen by offering technical wherewithal, finance/market support, and \nnetwork connections besides building and assisting strong narrative \nsupport to amplify RWE voices in policy discourse.\n\u2022Landscape analysis to identify new/existing opportunities as entry points \nfor RWE through continuous engagement to build their product, value \nproposition, network\u2019s capacity, and building linkages for sustainable \nbusinesses.\nIdentification of Problems through Formative Phase (8 months): From \nJune 2022 to January 2023, Start-Up!, New Delhi a private consultancy, and \nIndian Institute of Bank Management (IIBM), Guwahati a premier institute \nconducted a mixed method primary and secondary research study to ascertain \nbarriers to entry for women entrepreneurs, gender norms, policy frameworks, \nmotivations and efficacy of government interventions. Start Up! designed and \nconducted In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) with 25 sector experts and dialogue \nsessions with a total of 166 rural women entrepreneurs (RWE) comprising of \n96 RWE in Assam and 70 RWE in West Bengal. The RWE interviewed by Start \nUp! was largely in stages 0-3 (stage 0- seed stage, 1- self-employed or striving, \n2-start-up, 3 - stable or steadfast) of entrepreneurship. Less than 5% of RWE \nwere in stage 4 of scale and sector-shaper entrepreneurship. Given the current \nscenario, it\u2019s relevant for BBC to uplift RWE struggling in stage 0-3. Please \nrefer to page 4 and from page number 24 - 33 of the research report of Start \nUp! to know more about the various stages of entrepreneurship. IIBM\u2019s \nresearch (which is currently ongoing), includes both secondary and primary \nsources, across 5 districts in Assam (Kamrup Rural, Nalbari, Baksa, Goalpara \nand Sivsagar) and 3 districts in West Bengal (Coochbehar, Jalpaiguri and \nDarjeeling). There are 6 value chains that the research has focused on, namely, \nMushroom, Piggery, Floriculture, Dairy, Handloom and Tea. IIBM has \nintensively engaged with a total of 300 Women Entrepreneurs (50 women \nentrepreneurs from each value chain) along with 20 stakeholder consultations \nwhich includes aggregators from Mushroom and Piggery value chain, Eri Silk \nproducer company, Tea Board officials, company promoting floriculture, tea \nbrokers, handloom designers and market aggregators, Micro Finance \nInstitutions.\n \nAt RWE level, our key research and findings from pilot suggests:\n\u2022Stereotypical gender roles: In the Edelgive Foundation study, 70% of \nthe 1,235 women entrepreneurs admitted that domestic workload was \nOak Application Form     9\ntheir primary responsibility. Most women felt that it was against their \nculture/values to let their husband/other family members partake in \nhousehold chores.\n\u2022Top value chains for women: In the state of Assam and West Bengal \nthere is a huge untapped potential for upward mobility of RWE in the \nfollowing value chains : \noIn Assam: Tea with a special focus on small tea growers (women) \nand handloom.\noIn Assam and West Bengal: Livestock (pig, goat, poultry).\noIn West Bengal: Dairy and agriculture.\noEco-tourism and cultural tourism were identified as areas of huge \npotential in Assam.\n\u2022Access to information through digital skills: RWE do not have \naccess to appropriate information or guidance which is specific to their \nbusiness. It needs to be mentioned that most of the RWE are so involved \nin the operationalisation of their business that their attempts to seek \nadditional information are rather limited. \noIn Assam (92%) and West Bengal (87%) RWE strongly feel that \nlack of digital skill is an obstacle in expanding their business.\n\u2022Business skills for running an enterprise: Women usually run their \nenterprise as an informal entity and are not able to implement their \nbusiness management skills in formalising their entities owing to lack of \nskills, mentoring and coaching support. \noIn Assam (67%) and West Bengal (60%) RWE admitted that lack of \nbusiness knowledge and financial constraints contribute to \nstunted growth of their enterprise.\n\u2022Risk taking aptitude with respect to finance and business \nexpansion:  RWE do not demonstrate risk taking aptitude while \nmanaging their businesses. The average investment in starting their \nenterprise is INR 18,705 and almost 20% did not invest anything \n(Edelgive Foundation study). Further from this study, it was revealed \nthat only 9% of them took some loan. Women revealed that they do not \nwant to take loans because of the fear of inability to repay the loan, \nwhich would negatively impact their family and family pride. Since \nwomen do not have assets in their name, a large majority (83%) also feel \nthat they cannot mortgage assets to secure loans, if required. This \nmajorly deters women from taking loans. Further, 1% of women have \navailed of any government scheme and this is primarily because just \nabout 11% are aware of any schemes. Less than a third (29%) of those \nwho applied, could avail the scheme.  Considering a large proportion of \nwomen did not consider applying to the schemes even if aware (79%), \nthey were asked the reason behind this. Major reasons cited by these \nwomen were: non-availability of required documents (17%), thought the \nprocess is complex (15%), did not feel the need for any support (13%), \nand believed that such schemes are only to support the rich (7%). \noThe lack of financing remains the chief concern - 90 percent of \nwomen entrepreneurs in the country rely on informal sources of \nfinancing.\nOak Application Form     10\noIn Assam (83%) and West Bengal (60%), RWE are not aware of any \nfinancial linkage opportunities and an abysmal percentage (10-\n20%) in both states are aware of the government benefits for RWE \n(as per Start-Up study).\nOur Proposed Approach: Based on the reports, research findings and our \ncollaborative partner's experience in the sector, we know that women's \nentrepreneurship is a significant tool of empowerment for women, and \nthrough BBC we want to create an urge within the stakeholders across the \nboard to support this and contribute to the cause. We intend to do this through \necosystem transformation by shifting the mindset (where \nentrepreneurship become aspirational), infusion of innovation, \nestablishment of formal-informal RWE associations/hubs, and creation \nof new evidence based knowledge products for dissemination at two \nintervention levels:\n\u2022At the 3P (Policy-Players-Processes) Ecosystem Design Level: We \nwant to align our focus on bankers, financial, social, technology \ninstitutions and regulators to design and develop new products and \nprocesses for including women entrepreneurs from diverse socio-\neconomic profiles in value chains.\n\u2022At an Operational Demonstration-Delivery Level: We seek \ninvestments for long-term training, coaching and mentorship of women \nentrepreneurs to build access to capital, markets, and technologies for \nwomen entrepreneurs to scale. This will help in the co-creation of \nmultiplying social/ professional networks of grassroots business women \nand develop women entrepreneurs\u2019 voices and capacity to influence \neconomic and developmental agendas.\n\u2022At each level, as per the strength of respective BBC partner and \ncollective effort, our findings confirmed that five thematic capitals \nmost influence RWE on various stages of entrepreneurship lifecycle \n(seed, self-employed, start-up, stable and scale up) and are worth \ninvesting in:\n1.Personhood Capital : Autonomy or self/personhood. Celebrate and \nrecognize rural women entrepreneurs locally, at district-levels and \nacross states through running media campaigns to share stories of the \ntrue contribution of RWE.\n2.Knowledge Capital: Competencies or knowledge, skills. Non-\nconventional business management, mentoring and business leadership \nprograms \u2013 programs that are local and accessible, rooted in the RWE \ncontext, with faculty that comprises technical experts as well as role \nmodel RWE.\n3.Financial Capital: Access and control over resources, or ownership of \ncapital, assets tools and technology. Building narratives that build the \nconfidence of bankers in RW as credit-worthy and sound investment \nopportunity.\n4.Social Capital: Relationships or personal and professional social \nnetworks for collectivization to organize trade fairs, summits to amplify \nvoice and act as pressure groups to negotiate with family, market, \ngovernment etc.\nOak Application Form     11\n5.Recognition Capital: Increase RWE\u2019s reputation capital in their locus \nof control and influence through stories, films and awards.\n \nIn addition to this, BBC strongly recommends following value chain agnostic \ninputs are necessary for rural women to become entrepreneurs:\n1. Recognition for them that they are individuals who breathe life and have \nall the potential to do what they want.\n2. Access to awareness and knowledge on what are possibilities for them \nto do in their limited environments and unlimited responsibilities.\n3. Negotiations skill within the family to get time off to do what they \nchoose to do.\n4. Enabling environment of women and others who will build and amplify \nthe above.\n5. Working capital initially.\n6. Money management and financial literacy.\n7. Access to bank accounts.\nUsing Oak\u2019s Funding: With this context, through BBC partners, we seek to \nboost the entrepreneurial spirit in women and plot women\u2019s entrepreneurship \nas one of the key pathways to advance women\u2019s economic empowerment in \nIndia. It also aims to get stakeholders across the board including the \ngovernment, corporate, academia, think tanks, sector experts, philanthropy, \ninvestors, funding agencies, and not-for-profit sector together because we \nbelieve that it is only through synchronized efforts would we be able to create \na thriving transformational ecosystem for rural women entrepreneurship. AIF \nin the capacity of an intermediary partner is requesting funds from Oak \nFoundation to commission:\n\u2022A planning phase (9-12 months) will focus on the following activities \nnecessary towards effective implementation: \na. Onboarding of program team\nb. Conducting individual scoping studies by the individual partners \nto initiate their interventions\nc. Formalization and constitution of the different committees and \nfunctions within the BBC. Further details on this maybe referred \nto in Page no. 44 in the BBC Strategic Program Design document, \nas enclosed with this proposal.\nd. A Resource Mobilisation Plan which will include a toolkit for the \npartners to refer to with respect to the different areas from where \nresources may be leveraged, different types of resources that can \nbe leveraged, and what stages.\ne. A robust MEL plan will be owned by the Strategic Programme \nManagement Committee (SPMC), and an agency will be \nonboarded for external evaluation of the program.\n6. An implementation phase (13 - 32 months) which will include \ndemonstration and generating evidence from pilots covering select \nvalue chains; engaging with ecosystem players; \nOak Application Form     12\norchestrating mobilisation of RWEs within and across value chains; and \ndesign and roll out the communication strategy.\n7.Consolidation phase (33-48 months) : focus on the sustainability of \nthe initiative. This will include documentation, dissemination and \ncapacity building for greater adoption and promotion of successful \nstrategies. Resource mobilisation to sustain and grow the outcomes will \nbe a key focus area.\nDuring the implementation phase when BBC is able to demonstrate \ntransformative change in a small (in relative terms) number of RWE in select \nvalue chains; during and after the consolidation phase, BBC would amplify the \nimpact of its models through the following key allies:\n1. The MSME space\n2. Market systems\n3. Officers specific to the market systems\n4. Banks or rural credit facilities\n5. Large organisations in civil society like SEWA and others to see how \nthey have cracked what they have\n6. NRLM kind of initiatives for linkage\n7. Mens groups in the village levels\nEquity, Diversity, and Inclusion: Yes, AIF is committed to addressing it. All \nthe BBC partners are chosen to bring equity in opportunities, diversity in \nchoosing the target population, and inclusion of otherwise marginalized RWE. \nThe unique value addition from BBC is that it\u2019s designed to work at the \nintersection of finance and empowerment with an imperative to understand \nthe economics behind entrepreneurship to create an enabling and conducive \nenvironment for women-owned enterprises. In other women-focused \ninterventions, usually few elements are addressed that too in silos and more \nimportantly, from a social lens only. For RWE to be successful, enterprises \nneed to be nurtured where they are with skills relevant to the local context.", "6. PLACE HOLDER": "6. PLACE HOLDER", "7. OBJECTIVES": "7.

To \nstrengthen and sustain the collaboration, BBC will require a set of strategic \nand cross-cutting functions, which will be facilitated with CURIE (creativity, \nunity, respect, integrity and excellence) values embedded in the principles of \nresult oriented transformational leadership \u2013 a leadership that is driven \non achieving success through big vision thinking and intellectual \nstimulation to create a thriving, openly communicative work culture. \nThe process is participative and inclusive of skilled sector experts/ \ncompetent organizations and professionals across sectors who may be outside \nexisting BBC partners as the need arises and is committed to weave in \ncultural competency through involvement of local communities for better \nacceptability of interventions.\nRight Mix of Diverse Partners: One of the prime criteria for selecting \npartners has been their non-profit structure, strong roots in the local \ncommunity through direct implementation of programs in close \ncollaboration with local governance structures. The list of BBC members is not \nlimited to the list and may continue to expand in the implementation phase \nbased on synergetic alignment of priorities:\n1.AIFT, Gurgaon: Award winning non-profit. AIFT is committed to help \ncreate an India free from poverty, one in which everyone has access to \naffordable education, health care and livelihood opportunities.\n2.Centre for Education and Communication (CEC), New Delhi: \nFounded in 1982, CEC is a resource centre dedicated to research, \ncampaign and support on key concepts, ideas and policies that enhance \ndignified and sustainable livelihood options of workers, in particular \ninformal workers, and small producers.\n3.Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF), New Delhi:  DEF is an \nintegral digital action organization which creates information \nOak Application Form     19\nempowerment, equitable communities by providing digital access to \ninformation, knowledge and contextual capacity.\n4.Selco Foundation, Bengaluru: Pioneer in delivery of sustainable \nenergy to the poor in India in a manner that creates assets and results \nin long term poverty alleviation.\n5.Switch On Foundation, Kolkata: An award winning not for profit \norganization. Since 2008, SwitchON Foundation has led many \ninnovative projects and incubated a number of highly successful \nventures and initiatives in the areas of renewable energy access, \nagriculture and livelihoods, skilling and education and environment and \nclimate change.\n6.The Goat Trust, Lucknow: The Goat Trust works across value chain of \nGoat based products. We promote small livestock (Goat/sheep/ Backyard \nbirds rearing) based livelihood through demystifying production \ntechnology, building institutions and promoting standard of marketing \nand linkage.\nNewer Ways of Working Through Collaborative Building: To achieve \nthe highly complex layered multi-stakeholder solution of uplifting women \nthrough economic empowerment at an ecosystem level in India, AIF is \nproposing to work through a collaborative as opposed to an individual \norganization. A collaborative is a temporary alliance or partnering of \ngroups in order to achieve a common purpose or to engage in joint \nactivity. Forming collaboratives with other groups of similar values, \ninterests, and goals will allow AIF and BBC members to combine their \nresources and become more powerful than when they each acted alone \nand therefore increase their collective potential for success. AIF further \nbelieves that a collaborative can bring more expertise and resources to \nbear on complex issues, where the technical or personnel resources of any \none organization would not be sufficient.", "9.

We encourage you to be \nopen to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your \noutcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? \n(300 words):\n1. Research suggests women who earn in rural areas are more prone to \ngender-based domestic violence as there is a constant power \nstruggle as to who will own the money and spend it. The BBC program \nwill have to allocate resources to enhance provision of social security \nservices for existing and emerging RWE to minimize the impact of risk \nfactors at the household level.\n2. Entrepreneurship development is a long-term resource-intensive \ngame, besides in a collaborative-based partnership disagreement on a \nmutual goal and objective can threaten the success of the program. \nTherefore, rather than focusing on short-term quantitative outputs, the \ngrant program could focus on longer-term outcomes over a period of 5-\n10 years since ecosystem players on the groundwork in fragmented \nways.\n3. Working with governments is imperative, yet hard. Organizations would \nneed time and capacity building to focus on systems change and \nengage other stakeholders in congruent ways. Mainstream adoption of \nmodels will not move unless backed by data and evidence. This would \nrequire investment in research, business case development, and \ncreating a new and strategic narrative for RWE.\n4. At an operational level, forming and managing a collaborative can be a \nvery time-consuming and bureaucratic process that can take away \ntime from working directly on campaign issues and organization tasks. \nTo mitigate this risk, AIF will encourage democratic decision-making \nand sustained action by managing power dynamics within the group \nthrough transparent communication and appreciative inquiry for best \npractices, strategic planning, and organizational culture to increase the \nmomentum of initiatives.\n5. At a socio-political level, a high turnover rate among government \nofficials in the strategic positions of influence will hamper the advocacy \nagenda at the ecosystem level.

(maximum 300 \nwords):\nAID is a volunteer driven organisation based in the US with thirty chapters and \nabout 400 volunteers. There is a Board of Directors with six members currently. \nAll board members are long-time volunteers with ten to twenty years\u2019 experience \nwithin AID. There is an elected Executive Board (EB) consisting of nine to ten \nmembers and elected for a term of two years, responsible for operation and \ncoordination across chapters. There are two full time Development Coordinators \nbased in the US, who spend a few months working with the partners in India as \nwell. Another full time person works with our partners in eastern India and is \nbased in Kolkata.\n \nThere are five Jeevansaathis who work full time on various issues and across India. \nThey were long-time AID volunteers in the US who have gone back and started \nwork at the grassroots decades ago.\n \nAID works with close to 75 grassroots organizations across India on agriculture, \nhealth, education, gender and environmental justice.\n \nCurrently AID has a part time accountant based in India helping us. AID is looking \nto hire a part time person in the US as well within the next 2 months.\n \nAbout 37% of the leadership is women. There is a conscious effort to increase \ndiversity along the lines of faith, gender and caste.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20135\n6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nAID was started in 1991 as a volunteer-based organization at College Park, \nMaryland by students from India interested in community development and social \njustice. Over the years the idea behind AID appealed to many and interested \npeople formed chapters in many cities in the US. Today there are 30 chapters with \nabout 400 volunteers.\n \nAID began by supporting grassroots NGOs working in under-served areas. As AID \ngrew, so did its network at the grassroots in India. We understood the \ninterconnected nature of the problems and the need to work with the most \nmarginalized communities on health, education, agriculture, gender and the \nenvironment. Today, along with its partners, AID reaches out directly to several \nmillion people and strives to strengthen communities under their own leadership.\n \nA few prominent efforts:\n1. The Eureka educational program in Tamil Nadu was designed to improve \nthe quality of education, particularly math, science and language, in \nmarginalized communities. This program works with 80,000 children \nthrough 1,000 village educational centers throughout Tamil Nadu.\n2. In 2009 Cyclone Aila inundated the islands the Sunderbans in W Bengal \nwith saline water. During initial relief efforts, AID realized that reviving \nagriculture was critical to the community\u2019s well-being. Starting with 25 \nfarmers in 2009 today AID has worked with 25,000 farmers and helped them \nadopt sustainable organic agriculture. It has also facilitated sales of the \norganic produce in Kolkata.\nIn 2018, AID initiated a community based program on watershed development in 4 \ntribal districts of Jharkhand, bringing together grassroots groups and a resource \norganization. The project had a tremendous impact in its first year itself bringing \nwater and greenery to some of the drought stricken villages and over the last two \nyears. There has been a lot of demand from the neighboring villages but we are \nlimited by funds. In these 2 years we have treated close to 3000 hectares of land \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\nand planted about 3000 trees and hope for it to scale.\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nAID works with marginalized communities and groups across India to address \nissues they currently face. Through experience over the last two decades, AID has \nlearnt that the issues are cross-cutting and its support should not be limited to \nsingle issues, but rather towards an overall dignified life for the communities.\n \nAgriculture: The majority of India\u2019s population still has livelihoods based on \nagriculture and yet, farmers have been in distress for over a decade. AID has been \naddressing the agrarian crisis in India by -\n1. By providing relief to farmers in crisis: AID helps families of farmers who \nhave committed suicide and those affected by natural disasters, by \nproviding immediate support as well as logistical support to interface with \nthe administration. AID has worked with farmers after several natural \ndisasters helping them reclaim their land and restart agriculture. AID is \nworking in Sunderbans as we speak to revive agriculture after Cyclone \nAmphan.\n2. By promoting sustainable practices:  AID helps to train farmers to move \naway from chemical farming towards ecologically sustainable and \neconomically viable techniques. AID also works with landless families and \ntribal communities to improve food security through the practice of nutrition \ngardens.\n3. Advocating for farmer friendly policies:  AID works with advocacy groups to \nmake governments implement farmer-friendly policies.\nAID works with about 50,000 farmers mainly in West Bengal, Telangana, Andhra \nPradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.\n \nHealth: AID works with several partners across India to improve health equity and \nmaking quality and affordable healthcare accessible to all.\n1. AID works with physicians and health workers in remote areas without \naccess to healthcare - innovating in extremely low resource settings, \ntraining village health workers and developing appropriate technologies and \nunderstanding social determinants of health.\n2. AID supports groups demanding access to affordable healthcare as a right \nby organizing people to hold the public health system accountable.\n3. Along with its partners, AID understands that food insecurity is a major \ncause of illness and undernourished children face irreversible damage \nbefore the age of 3. AID supports nutritional programs for children under 3 \nand works to improve the Government run Anganwadis.\nAID works with healthcare partners in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil \nNadu, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka reaching out to at least 120,000 people.\n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nEducation: AID works to make culture appropriate education accessible to all.\n1. Developing Curriculum:  Activity-based lessons with interactive materials \nmotivate children to explore concepts from multiple angles rather than by \nrote.  Government, non-government schools as well as after-school centers \nuse these methods and materials.\n2. Strengthening Public Schools: AID partners engage with government \nschools to improve teaching methods and see that all children have a right \nto meaningful, quality education.\n3. Reaching the Unreached: In underserved communities, AID partners run \nschools and bridge courses to help students in remote and tribal areas \nprepare for and adjust in mainstream schools.  AID also supports model \nschools implementing effective innovative techniques in rural areas\nAID and its partners reach out to 330,000 children through its education \nprograms.\n \nGender Equality:  AID works with women's groups towards a gender just society. \nIt supports education of women young and old, advocating for their rights and \nencouraging leadership by women and access to independent livelihoods. We also \npartner with groups providing support to survivors of violence.\n \nWe have been working with transgender groups advocating for their equality in \nsociety,  striving for access to a dignified livelihood and equal access to \nhealthcare.\n \nEnvironmental Justice:\n1. AID empowers communities to take action to defend the environment by \nequipping communities to measure/monitor pollution of land, water and air \nand raise it with the officials.\n2. AID promotes community control of natural resources helping communities \ngain their rights under the Forest Rights Act.\nAID engages with communities for watershed restoration and afforestation efforts.\n6e.

Gram Sabhas in at least the 10 sites will meet regularly and take decisions \ndemocratically. By the end of 3 years, a majority of the Gram Sabhas in the \nentire work area will be meeting regularly with participation of women and \nyouth. The Gram Sabhas will be engaged in filing the CFRs.\n2. Empowered with the knowledge of FRA, the community will be more \nassertive about their rights both at individual and community level. In the \npast they have resisted clear felling of trees on community land. In terms of \nindividual rights, we can expect people to use their constitutional rights like \nfiling police complaints against harassment and intimidation.\n3.

Objective 2\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\nActivites:\n \n1.Community mobilization:\nThe entire livelihood initiative through cluster farming is going to be \nimplemented in a democratic way through the process of participatory \ndecision making by the Gram Sabha (GS). The GS will identify interested \nfarmers and the common land for farming. This mobilization process \ninvolves regular meetings and interaction with the respected GS in the \nvillage in order to convince them to take up and monitor this activity as the \nabsolute decision making authority of the forest village as per FRA.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - Sept. 2020 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n2.Identification of sites and cluster formation:\nThe Gram Sabha (GS) will be interacting with the interested farmers in the \nvillage and will form the cluster with 20 to 25 farmers.. Then the cluster will \ndecide in presence of GS about their strategy planning, budget, sharing of \nprofit etc. The GS will be playing an instrumental role in identifying the sites \nof farming as well. 10 sites of 5 hectares each will be identified to start with \nin year 1. This site selection involves meetings and having agreement with \nthe land owners for private land and passing resolution in GS meetings - this \nprocess will be done by GS.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - Oct. 2020 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n         3. Central workshop with community leaders:\nThe central level conceptual workshop will be organised with some of the \nleading farmers in the clusters along with the selected members of Gram \nSabha (GS) and a few members from the monitoring team so that the entire \nconcept of this livelihood initiative can be imparted in the community. This \nworkshop will be based on the idea of agroecological farming which \nincludes different techniques of soil and water management, intercropping, \nmix cropping, promotion and cultivation of indigenous varieties and so on. \nThere will be 1 central level workshop every year.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - July 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n        4. Follow up workshop on ground:\nThe follow up workshop will be organised with the farmers at the ground \nlevel. This will be more of a hand holding training with the farmers where \nway by using all those methods and concepts learned from the \nagroecological workshops.\n3. This farming practice will start with 250 farmers in 10 villages. Each year at \nleast 100 new farmers will be added to the cluster. The total cultivable area \nwill also be increased each year depending on the availability of adjacent \nland. It is expected that the farmer\u2019s annual income from the farming sector \nwill be increased at least by 40% at the end of 3 years. \n4.

Cooperation\nDescribe the level of cooperation with other organisations and networks \nand explain how this cooperation helps achieve your goals (maximum 300 \nwords):\nThe tropical forests of sub-Himalayan Bengal in India contain rich biodiversity and \nanthropogenic wealth. Several indigenous communities, such as Rava, Mech, \nDukpa, Garo and many Jharkhandi adivasi groups (Oraon, Kheria, Santhal, Munda, \nBaraik) live here. Lepcha, Limbu, Rai, Tamang, Sherpa and other ethnic groups \nnow being generically termed as Gorkha  also live here. Many of these people were \nbrought in from surrounding states and forced to stay in the ghettoized \nsettlements of forest villages set up by British foresters as labor colonies in the \nlate 19th and early 20th Century.\nColonial laws passed by the British Government made it unlawful for forest tribes \nto even live within the forest or source their daily needs. The British also \nconverted forest land to monoculture commercial timber plantations destroying \nthe forest ecosystem in the process.\nAfter Independence the Indian Government too, created policies with similar goals. \nEven laws passed ostensibly for conservation targeted forest communities as \n\u201cdestructive\u201d to the environment and evicted them. Illegal timber harvesting \ncontinued and contributed to heavy deforestation, often also victimizing forest \ncommunities. Today, the timber industry takes advantage of poverty among these \ncommunities and employs them to harvest timber from the forest thus adding to \nongoing environmental degradation.\nThe Forest Rights Act (FRA), passed in 2006, gave joint ownership of forest areas \nto both the Government and indigenous forest-based communities. It empowered \nthese communities to form governing institutions that would administer the forest \ntogether with the Forest Department. Currently, it suffers from inadequate \nimplementation due to lack of awareness among the affected communities.\nThe main actors involved in the larger context of the work are the peoples\u2019 social \nmovement, an NGO, the forest communities and solidarity groups. Another \nstakeholder is the Forest Department.\nPeople from the community are involved in every step of the process from site \nselection to forming the groups to participate in agriculture. The learning centers \non the other hand will be open to all youth of 12-18 years in the community. Gram \nSabhas will be the main agency involved in the filing of the CFR as well as \nmapping the community forest areas.", "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9.

We aim to enable systemic improvements that build socio-economic \nresilience for over 139 million migrants.\nThe MRC has a strong affinity with Oak\u2019s commitment to address global, social and \nenvironmental issues, particularly among the disadvantaged. The MRC enables the \nOak Foundation to advance these goals both systemically and at scale, whilst \nleveraging the commitment of large institutional funders such as Omidyar \nNetwork, Dell Foundation, H.T.

DAI is committed to end all forms of forced labour and \nviolence against women and children across South Asia through the partnership \nwith local organizations. The Proposed program will be implemented by Jan \nSahas*. Jan Sahas is a 20-year-old community centric organization working \nintensively in 78 districts across eleven states of India. Jan Sahas is working with \nthe most excluded social groups on safe migration and workers\u2019 protection; and \nprevention of sexual violence against women and children. At the time of its \ninception in 2000, Jan Sahas worked in one district of Madhya Pradesh with a staff \nstrength of 12 volunteers. Today, we have grown to a strong workforce of \n1882 (523 full-time and 1,359 part-time) staff and 640 volunteers spread across \n18,000+ villages and towns across the country.\nAt Jan Sahas, we are committed to ensuring that our staff and projects operate \nwithin the framework of diversity, equity, inclusion and we actively promote and \nexpect gender-sensitive behaviour. In line with best practice, we aim to have a \n50% representation of women among the project staff, preferably in leadership \nroles and four of our seven Board members are female. \nOur organisational structure comprises cross-functional teams. However, the \nboard of Directors are the main governing body of the organisation, followed by \nthe Chief Executive Officer.

Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nJan Sahas has been working with the most excluded communities for over two \ndecades, providing support on issues such as prevention and response to gender-\nbased violence, forced labour, and caste-based manual scavenging. This includes: \n1) Uniquely blending our grassroots-led approach with a focus on scale, facilitating \ndirect support in ~60 districts across nine states of India, serving~2,000,000 \nwomen and girls across program areas, tracking >200,000 migrant workers, \nrescuing >4.2k bonded and child labourers, and delivering >128,000 entitlements \nto migrants. During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jan Sahas \nworked with 42 non-profits across 19 states in India to address needs of >1 million \nmigrant families through immediate relief support. There have been a few projects \nthat have been instrumental in achieving this. These include: an Initiative to \nsubstantially reduce the practice of Forced and Child Labour (F&CL) in cotton \nproduction in Madhya Pradesh, India; Fighting Forced Labour with Adivasi and \nDalit communities in South Asia; Nirmaan Mazdoor Sashaktikaran Karyakram \n(NMSK) and Bandhuaa Majdoor Mukti Abhiyan.\n2) With support from CBOs (Community Based Organisations), Jan Sahas has \ninfluenced key legislation (The Landmark Prohibition of Employment as Manual \nScavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013), and participates on various \ngovernment working commissions (for example, Government of Madhya Pradesh\u2019s \ncommission on migrant workers, NITI Aayog\u2019s Working Group for Social Justice \nand Empowerment to support on migration).  Jan Sahas\u2019 promoted CBO, Rashtriya \nGarima Abhiyan and has influenced several initiatives at departmental and state \nlevel on the issue of manual scavenging and gender justice. \nJan Sahas aims to address the issues faced specifically by migrant families at an \nunprecedented scale and crucially it has quickly emerged into new geographical \nareas. Thus, Jan Sahas believes in a collaborative approach, partnering with CBOs \nwith similar values across the country to facilitate direct support through its \ninterventions. \n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nOur priority is to adopt a learning-based organic scale-up approach that \nfocuses on quality and continues to ensure strong accountability to our \ncommunities. Based on our learnings from our projects in the space of migration, \nwe have developed a detailed scale up model. \nSince October 2020, we have started working using our current operating model \non the theme in 50 districts and supporting 40 additional civil society \norganizations to intervene in another 50 districts. We are also piloting innovations \nto work at greater scale and update our operating models over the next five years. \nThe key to our success will be a unified technology system: a unified database of \n10 million workers along with their information based on which of the three \nservices (social security, responsible recruitment, and worker protection) they opt \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\nfor. Our Jan Saathi social security entitlements application and national labour \nhelpline will be at the top of our database. We are currently developing this \ntechnology system and intend to integrate these with government systems to \nradically simplify the delivery of benefits to workers.\nTo achieve all of this, we have made our investments in technology, a second line \nof leadership, and strengthening internal systems give us confidence that we can \nbuild capacities that complement our strengths in grassroots reach, experience of \nlarge-scale programs, and commitment to excluded communities to anchor this \ninitiative.\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nThere are an estimated 139 million internal migrant workers in India. Despite \nbeing large contributors to India\u2019s GDP, migrant workers face systematic \ndisenfranchisement due to power imbalance & high vulnerability. As a result, they \nface three principal challenges: Non-recognition by states, & lack of social security \nleading to debt and poverty.\nUnder the proposed project we intend to use the corridor approach (work at \nsource & destination together). The proposed geographic focus is the West \nBengal migration corridor. We have selected 4 high prevalence districts of \nmigration in West Bengal (Murshidabad, Nadia, Bardhaman and Birbhum) \nas source districts & Mumbai-Suburban and Delhi-NCR region as \ndestination areas.\nAccording to Census 2011, West Bengal ranks fourth among states from where \npeople migrate to for work and employment. Approximately 80% of work-migrants \nfrom the state migrate to Maharashtra (45.3%) and Delhi-NCT (34%). Research \nshows that much of the migrant population in the country belong to lower-income \nquintile groups and are likely to be deprived of social security. \nIn 2004-05, approximately 35% of workers in rural West Bengal were out of social \nsecurity coverage and this increased to 50% in 2011-12. Furthermore, according \nto a study on the access to flagship programme benefits and public services in \nWest Bengal, it was found that access to benefits was critically low due to lack of \nawareness, procedural complexities, harassment, apathy of state officials and \nopportunity cost being higher than benefit. \nThe access to benefits is critically limited due to a lack of awareness, delay, \nprocedural complexities, harassment, insensitivity of implementing officials and \nelected representatives, adverse selection & opportunity cost being higher than \nbenefit. Given the high rates of poverty, out-migration and poor access to \nentitlement, it is critical that concerted efforts are placed into improving the social \nsecurity coverage in West Bengal.\nWe decided that launching the MRC now would have the most impact for the \nfollowing reasons:\nUnprecedented political will and demand for Jan Sahas\u2019 support on \nmigrants\u2019 issue: Post-COVID, migrant welfare has become a major political issue:\n1) Central and State governments have embarked on social security registration \ndrives, several have set up migrant welfare commissions. The central government \naccepted $1 billion credit fund from the World Bank to create a social registry for \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139\nstrengthening social security.\n2) Jan Sahas has partnered with multiple governments (for example, Delhi, \nMadhya Pradesh, Telangana) and we are discussing partnerships with several \nothers. Partnering with West Bengal and Maharashtra has been considered in the \nproject plan.\nUnprecedented industry willingness to support migrants, including Jan \nSahas\u2019s mission: Industry bodies such as CREDAI and FICCI have taken up the \ncause of social security as a trust-building measure and to improve the value \nproposition for workers. Four of the largest Indian construction companies (L&T, \nGodrej, Lodha, Mahindra & Mahindra) co-signed an open letter with Jan Sahas, \nadvocating for governments to deliver on its policies including benefits for migrant \nworkers and committing to partner with government and civil society.\nDemonstrated interest from philanthropy and civil society to support \nmigrant workers: Large funders such as Omidyar Network, Azim Premji \nPhilanthropic Initiatives, Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, HT Parekh Foundation \nhave recalibrated strategies to support migrant families. \nWith both need and the potential for high impact, the MRC seeks to harness the \nopportunity to capitalize on opportunity and address systemic at scale. In the 6 \nmonths of operations MRC has registered 1,036,626 migrant households of which \n424,400 were women led, filled 1,192,936 social security applications, ensured \nbenefits received to 847,556 migrant individuals. While, the helpline received 2871 \nand 753 cases were registered through different sources (helpline and field). \nWe are fully cognisant of the threats facing the program and have established a \nplan to address them:\n1) Current and future FCRA law amendments hinder sub-granting funds to \npartner CBOs.\n2) Reduced bargaining power of migrants and the industry\u2019s willingness to \nsupport reforms due to added vulnerability of migrants. Additionally, the impact \nof the pandemic has sparked a change in labour codes.", "7. OBJECTIVES": "7.

In the long-term, this could \nsubstitute or supplement government\u2019s own data registrie\nTo overcome the barriers, we intend to train (on this tech platform) and leverage \n59 Jan Saathis and block-level field workers, many of whom are from high-\nmigration and historically excluded communities. In each district, we aim to build \nawareness, onboard workers onto our tech platform, conduct on-the-spot eligibility \nchecks and provide support in accessing key social security benefits (e.g., land \nrights, insurance, education, and other key benefits). The Jan Saathis will register \nthese workers on the platform and update progress after check in calls or follow \nup meetings. Jan Saathis/field workers will also train and draw support from \nvillage-based \u2018barefoot lawyers\u2019 from the community, who will be trained to build \nawareness within their villages regarding entitlements and basic rights. With state \nand industry buy-in through MoUs, Jan Saathis / field workers will help to drive \nsocial security registrations at scale. \n2. Innovations to improve efficiency and sustainability of social security \ndelivery systems: Apart from the Jan Saathi model and continuous improvements \ntherein, the MRC aims to design and implement interventions that enable the \ndelivery of social security faster, better and more cost-efficiently. They will be \nmeasured and tracked through the MRC tech platform in pilot areas, prior to \nscaling. Potential and planned interventions include:\nLeveraging business correspondents for social security delivery. This is an ongoing \nactivity.( Business Correspondents are deployed by banks to deliver basic banking \nservices outside the bank branch. Migrant workers use their services to send and \nreceive remittances and carry out other basic:\na. Banking transactions. We believe the relationship will be mutually beneficial as \nthe BCs will not only get an opportunity to earn additional revenue through \nprovision of complimentary services (migrant registration and social security \n7.1.b. Objective 1\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\n1) 4,00,000 workers and their families registered for, and aware of the key social \nsecurity schemes in 3 years.\n2) 2,40,000 workers receiving key benefits in 3 years\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201311\ndelivery) but also help to increase cross-sell opportunities).\nb. Integrating our social security technology with government systems through \ninteroperable Application Programming Interfaces or integrating with Common \nService Centres by leveraging MoUs for social security delivery with the state \ngovernment. \n7.2.a. Objective 2 (maximum one sentence):\nEnabling responsible recruitment. (this is consistent with the wording of Objective \n1)\n7.2.c. Objective 2\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\n1. Advocate for responsible recruitment within industry, in partnership \nwith financiers, brands and industry associations. We intend to partner and \nadvocate with companies (both of construction and textiles), focusing on the \nlargest companies to strengthen worker support. In particular, we intend to \nleverage financiers (e.g., HDFC Bank), brands (e.g., C&A, H&M, Arvind Mills), and \nindustry bodies (e.g., CII, FICCI, ASSOCHAM, CREDAI), to strengthen their norms \nand expectations from members, and drive downstream improvements across their \nmembership and supply chains. We will also advocate for adherence of norms that \ndisproportionately affect women (e.g., implementation of POSH Act, equal wages \nfor equal work, better sanitation facilities, and fair growth opportunities);\n2. Co-creating mechanisms for developing implementable solutions for \nresponsible recruitment. We aim to engage with the financiers /investors, \nbrands, industry association and companies to identify key priorities, \nopportunities, and gaps in the sector and within the value chain.  Ultimately, we \nwould co-create a pathway for developing some of the solutions for building \nresponsible recruitment practices within the company and its supply chain. The \nsolutions may differ depending on the size and scale of the company and the \nregion or geographies they operate in. Such partnerships and adoption by large \ncompanies in construction and textiles will strengthen worker welfare; likely \nimprove worker retention at a time when companies are facing labour shortages \nand play a signalling role for other companies in the sector too. Our objective \nthrough such engagement is for industry to own such initiatives, including publicly \nowning its success.\n3. New model for placement support by leveraging government portal. We \nhave partnered with the Quality Council of India to pilot the UNNATI portal, which \naims to connect 200 million workers with job providers. Aside from leveraging this \n7.2.b. Objective 2\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\n 1,00,000 workers responsibly recruited in 3 years by 15+ companies and industry \nassociations.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201312\nto influence government planning, we will use our learnings from this in year 2 to \ndesign a model that encompasses our database of migrant workers and the labour \ndemand from large companies to support employment opportunities for migrant \nworkers (e.g., in partnership with existing recruitment agents). \n7.3.a. Objective 3 (maximum one sentence):\nEnabling protection. (consistent with Objectives 1 & 2)\n7.3.c. Objective 3\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\n1.  National, 24X7 migrant multi-lingual labour helpline: Our toll-free \nhelpline will provide information to workers on their rights and entitlements \nand register complaints regarding forced labour. It will facilitate rescue support, \nwhere required in coordination with district authorities. Registering the worker on \nour tech platform also enables the MRC to reconnect with the worker over an \noutgoing call and provide information that allows them to connect to resource \ncentres and Jan Saathis. 30% of the Jan Saathis and helpline staff will be women to \nensure female workers and family members are comfortable to reach out to them \nand can better enable reach.\n2.  Remedial and legal support through lawyers\u2019 initiative forum: the MRC \nwill facilitate dispatch support for cases received over the helpline or through \nother touch points. This includes:\na.  field workers in districts coordinating with local authorities to support/rescue \nworkers in forced labour situations; in recent cases in Madhya Pradesh, MRC staff \nhave advised local authorities, enabling them to deliver rescue efforts \nindependently.   \nb.  legal aid through the Lawyer\u2019s Initiative Forum (a Jan Sahas promoted, pro-\nbono forum of +1,400 lawyers), or part-time lawyers hired in each district.\nFor dispatch services our approach has been to collaborate strategically with other \ncivil society initiatives such as those by ILO, UNDP and Aajeevika Bureau and \nother prominent Civil society Organisations in order to drive systemic changes. In \norder to avoid delicacy of efforts we will transfer cases to network organisations \nwith capacity and presence in the geography.\nOver the next 3-5 years, our goal is to establish the helpline and the field worker \ndispatch support as a standalone public good, adopted by Government, akin to \nChildLine.\n7.3.b. Objective 3\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\nWe aim to reduce forced labour by 60% (in the districts of project operation) by \nmaking worker protection support available to workers.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201313\n3.  Agency and awareness building for self-protection: \na.  At source, the MRC will scale Jan Sahas\u2019s barefoot lawyer volunteer program \nwhich trains motivated, local youths to build awareness and agency in their own \nvillages.\nb.  Prior to migration, each worker under the project will be trained at source on \nrights and entitlements at the destination, remedies available, best practices for \nthem to adopt, and a pocket-sized handbook to keep their own record of work and \nfinancial transactions, along with key information such as the National helpline \nnumber.\nc.  At destination, field workers will engage migrants on rights, socialize MRC \nofferings and provide other critical support to them, including anything identified \nthrough the handbook. \nWe will set up District migration resource centres, these district level units will \nfacilitate personalized information services, advice and trainings for migrants and \ntheir families on availing benefits, legal rights, industry norms, and protective \nmeasures available. The resource centre will also act as a hub for worker \nprotection outreach and dispatch services.\n4.  Research for worker protection:\nEvidence-based knowledge on sexual violence against female migrant workers \nacross the textile and construction value chain, to enable informed \nstrategy/intervention design and policy advocacy towards prevention of sexual \nviolence. The study will identify the factors that enable sexual violence and amplify \nthe experiences of female migrant workers including the root causes for non-\nreporting of such cases formally.", "8. COOPERATION": "8. Cooperation\nDescribe the level of cooperation with other organisations and networks \nand explain how this cooperation helps achieve your goals (maximum 300 \nwords):\nThe MRC unites organisations and networks who will support the execution of the \nprogram. These organisations can be further categorized as Implementation \nPartners and Strategic Partners.\nImplementation Partners: these are organisations that complement Jan Sahas\u2019s \ngeographic reach and ability to provide direct support to migrant communities: \nWe have currently partnered with 16 CBOs across 19 districts with a goal to work \nwith ~40-45 CBOs across 40-45 districts. Jan Sahas held workshops and \ndiscussions with long-term partner CBOs (e.g., Yuva Vikas Mandal, Gramin \nSwavalamban Samiti, Progressive Society) to validate priorities and develop the \nMRC strategy. Leaders of long-term partner CBOs routinely join Jan Sahas\u2019s \ninternal workshops and meetings.\nStrategic partners: organisations which complement Jan Sahas\u2019s strengths at the \nProject Monitoring Unit, include:\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201314\n1) Global Development Incubator (GDI): who helped co-create the concept of the \nMRC. Their expertise lies in building collaboratives and multi-stakeholder \ninitiatives globally, including providing support on design and strategy.

Evaluation\nHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):\nThe process monitoring flow will consist of the following steps: \n1.  Data entry / collection and analysis: Field Officers, MIS coordinators will collect \nand enter data. Monthly, Quarterly, Annual and SWAT Reports will be generated \nwith data and field visit insights, led by MEL Manager. Reports will include \nrecommendations on further research, rapid assessments, training needs and \nadaptation of strategy, led by the MEL Manager.\n2.  Report Dissemination & learnings: MEL team will share monthly and annually \nwith management; district team leads and partner CBOs. Monthly and annual \nmeetings will take place to share learnings, understand challenges and \ntroubleshoot. Training will be carried out with specific teams, when required and \nannual refresher training will be provided when necessary. \n3.  Senior Management Team (SMT) meetings: based on MEL and team meetings \nfeedback, SMT will discuss major roadblocks, challenges, progress-check, and \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201316\nshare success stories and learnings, and re-align on the way forward. The SMT will \nthen formulate rapid assessments, research and advocacy plans. \nProcess/ Implementation Evaluation: leveraging internal strengths of \ntechnology-based tools and real-time dashboards, we will undertake self-\nevaluations towards improvement of our delivery model and tracking system. As \ndescribed in the MEL framework, progress on KPIs and activities will be monitored \nmonthly and annually, and further \u201cSWAT\u201d teams will be formed to address \nbottlenecks such as conversion time of entitlements and drive \u201cfast fails\u201d.\nIn the past, such process evaluations have helped to improve program \nperformance, implementation rhythm and in mid-term corrective action in a \nphased manner \u2013 that is, learnings from one phase helping in next phase activities. \nWe strongly believe this adaptability in program strategies and ground operations \nhas been the key in the success of our interventions with highly dynamic \ncommunities such as migrants. \nThe systemic changes will be evaluated based on comparative analysis of the \ngovernment database / reports with our Social registry and analytics and third-\nparty evaluations to map relevance, effectiveness, efficacy, impact and \nsustainability, in reducing exploitation and socio-economic vulnerability of migrant \nfamilies and facilitation of safe migration.", "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11. Future Plans\nHow will the grant influence the organisation and future plans? (maximum \n300 words):\nThe MRC has brought together components to contribute to nation-wide system \nchanges.  The MRC envisions a deep level of engagement with all key stakeholders \n\u2013 communities, industry and government, enabling depth of experience and \nlearnings. We believe that assets (e.g., industry assessment tools, research \nproducts), learnings (e.g., from pilots and scaling of interventions), and networks \n(e.g., of companies partnering with the MRC, some of whom will have global \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201317\npresence) developed through the course of the project by the MRC and its \npartners have significant potential for sharing, translation, & potentially \nreplication to other geographies.\nCurrently, from Oak Foundation we are seeking a contribution for interventions in \nthe West Bengal, Mumbai and Delhi Corridor for over 3 years. This contribution \nwould make Oak Foundation one of the joint largest funders of the MRC. The MRC \nconsiders the Oak Foundation as a key funder due to its specific commitment \ntowards migrant communities and driving systems change in the sector. As the \nduration of the MRC is over 5 years, we intend to allocate the remaining funding \nfrom funds already raised from donors like Omidyar Network and Michael & Susan \nDell Foundation (MSDF) and additional fundraising. \nBeyond 5 years, our target for sustainability and scale is adoption by the \ngovernment boards (such as BOCW) and the private sector. Thus, moving away \nfrom the need for further philanthropic funding and towards 80% adoption by the \nprivate companies. We believe that large companies will see financial and \nreputational benefits of facilitating social security entitlements for their workers \nand will be willing to cover the costs of delivery. \nAs a part of the consortium, we have multiple donors (MSDF, Godrej, Omidyar \nNetwork, H.T.

(300 words)\nCPF was established in the backdrop of realising the goal of forest dependent \ncommunities in the management of forest resources as per the National Forest \nPolicy 1988. CPF got registered in August 2002. The organisation has \nmandated to work on other natural resources as part of the landscapes and \necosystems in which forests are a part.\nCPF worked with Government and civil society organization in promoting the \nJoint Forest Management, and later the Community Forest Management \nOak Application Form     6\nprograms. It worked with 680 Vanasamrakshana Samithis in 32 Forest Ranges \nwith 32 NGO partners. They were spread over 12 districts in the three regions \nof undivided Andhra Pradesh, representing 80,800 households and protecting \nover 1,00,000 (one lakh) hectares of forest.\nCPF understood that forest-based livelihoods alone not sufficient for \nenhancing the incomes and conserving the natural resources. It was also \nrealized that tribal communities were unable to access basic services and \nsocial security schemes because of remoteness and apathy of officials. This led \nCPF to work with communities and government on entitlements and \nsustainable NRM based livelihoods through community-based institutions.\nKey Achievements\nI.      Agro-Ecologcial Practices and Water resource development\n\u20224065 farmers following agroecological practices in an extent of 3000 \nacres\n\u2022Promotion of horticulture plantations among 500 farmers in 500 acres\n\u202216569 acres of land was treated with land under cultivation increasing \nby 11% and ground water availability by 66%\nII.

What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? \nHow will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and \ndecide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nAlienation of tribals from the forest has dwindled their livelihoods, food \nsecurity and increased poverty. It reduced their involvement in sustainable \nforest management and harvesting practices of NTFP.  This led to adverse \nimpact on conservation of forest eco-system. Lack of awareness and skills to \nhave constructive and collaborative engagement with government reduced \naccess to avail rights and entitlements.\nOver two decades, CPF worked with indigenous and other resource poor \ncommunities in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha. The organization \nfacilitated the communities to access rights on forest resources and supported \nOak Application Form     7\nthem in sustainable natural resource management through promoting \ncommunity institutions. This enabled them to reap the collective advantages \nof sustainable extraction and value addition of NTFP, participatory natural \nresource management and access entitlements from government.\nCPF undertakes works that aligns with its vision. Before planning any \nintervention, action research is undertaken to analyze and identify the change \nand roles to be played by CPF and other stakeholders. The intervention is \nplanned in a collaborative approach with defined objectives and outcomes \ninvolving community in planning, implementing and monitoring, enabling \nthem towards sustainability.\nCPF strategically works with government to build rapport between \ncommunities and concerned departments for leveraging funds for community \nneeds. It appraises them about its work for possible replication.\nCPF strives to ensure equity and equality in its functioning with women \nplaying equal role in all its interventions. It facilitates in building their \ncapacities, gain access and ownership over resources and become decision-\nmakers.\nA scoping study was conducted in West Bengal, while interacting with relevant \nstakeholders to comprehend the prevailing policies, programs and their \nimplementation in proposed project locations.\nBased on the observations from the scoping study, CPF proposes to work in \nRanibandh block, Bankura district of West Bengal because of its dense forest \nand high tribal population (Savara-PVTG, Santhal, Munda, Singh Sardar etc) \nwith 47.1 % (Census, 2011). The main source of livelihood is agriculture, \nlivestock and NTFP and majority are small and marginal farmers depending \non rain fed agriculture. Though the district receives around 1400 mm rainfall, \nyet cultivation of crop primarily depends on constricted period of erratic \nrainfall. Due to lack of proper water harvesting structures, water percolation \nto the ground is minimal and irrigation facility is low. The farmers are \npredominantly into mono crop cultivation i.e., paddy. The farming practices \nare inorganic leading to high input cost and negative environmental impacts.\nThe Sundarban estuary with mangrove forest is inhabited by the resource poor \nand vulnerable communities. Owing to historical reasons coupled with climatic \nextremities and natural calamities, it remains one of the extremely \nunderdeveloped places with 34 % below poverty line. Livelihood depends on \nagriculture (24.37%), un-organized labour (36.35%), house hold industries \n(4.86%) and others (34.42%) including fishery, forest resource collection [1]. \nThe inhabitants of the region are also extremely vulnerable in various physical \nand socio-economic indicators.\nIn Sunderban, CPF propose to work on enhancing access of entitlements to \ncommunities in Sandeshkhali-I Block of North 24 Parganas District due to the \nhigh social vulnerability of the region with 25.95% of the population belonging \nto ST and 30.90% belonging to SC communities.\nCPF vision and past experience of working with tribal and resource poor \ncommunities and Oak foundation\u2019s focus areas to support the indigenous \ncommunities in West Bengal will bring in synergy in advancing the rights, \navailing entitlements and livelihood development in the proposed area of \nintervention.\nOak Application Form     8\nOak Foundation funding will be used for facilitating the communities to \nadopt crop diversification through improved agriculture practices, enhance \nlivelihoods and enable the communities to access their rights and \nentitlements.\n[1] Census, 2011, West Bengal State Climate Action Plan, 2021", "6.

OBJECTIVES\nThis is the most important part of your application, as it is your opportunity to explain \nwhat you want to achieve and what will be different because of your work. We \nunderstand that social and environmental change is complex and there are a \nmultitude of factors that contribute to change. We want to understand how you define \nyour role in the overall change you hope to make. You may find it helpful to discuss \nthis with your Oak Programme Officer, and others in your own organisation.   \n7.a. Objectives\nList here up to 3 main objectives for this grant (one sentence per objective). Think of objectives as goals \nthat can be achieved within the lifetime of the grant.  We encourage you to think of objective(s) that are \nambitious but also achievable.  \nOverall objective / Goal\nImproving livelihoods of tribals, resource poor and other vulnerable \ncommunities through promoting sustainable natural resource management \nand enhancing access to entitlements by building linkages with the \nGovernment institutions in 25 forest fringe villages of Ranibandh block of \nBankura district and 12 villages in Sandeshkhali-I block of North 24 Parganas.\nSpecific Objectives\n1. Formation and strengthening the village level institutions/groups while \nensuring women leadership in these institutions\n2. Promoting agro-ecological practices, crop diversification and water \nresource development for food & nutritional security amongst male and \nfemale farmers\n3. Enhancing access to alternative livelihoods among landless, resource \npoor and other forest dependent communities while keeping with special \nemphasis on women farmers\n4. Enabling project communities to access and avail their constitutional \nrights and entitlements\nBackground and Context\nGiven the experience of working in watershed project locations, CPF propose \nto work in the watershed areas in Randibandh block of Bankura district \nOak Application Form     9\ncovering 25 villages of Ranibandh, Barikul and Rautora Gram Panchayats. The \nIntegrated Watershed Management Programme, West Bengal was \nimplemented in the proposed project locations in the year 2011-12 covering a \ntotal geographical area of 8819 ha of which the total treatable area was 5398 \nha. It was observed that the benefits of creation of these watershed structures \ncould not be sustain due to lack of emphasis on improved agriculture \npractices, creation and strengthening of farmers institutions and bringing in \nconvergence of various government schemes for the benefit of tribal and other \nresource poor households.\nThe present project aims to address the above-mentioned gaps. And it would \ndemonstrate how the watershed projects in the forest fringe villages could be \ntaken to the next level to reap the benefits and also sustain the initiatives \nthrough community participation.\nThe Sundarban estuary with mangrove forest is inhabited by the resource poor \nand vulnerable communities, owing to historical reasons coupled with climatic \nextremities and natural calamities. The inhabitants of the region are also \nextremely vulnerable in various physical and socio-economic indicators \nincluding infrastructure, food security, healthcare, education, drinking water \nand sanitation. It was observed that, livelihoods based on natural resources \nalone will not effectively sustain the people of the region. CPF proposes to \nwork on enhancing access to entitlements for communities covering 12 \nvillages of Boyermari-I, Boyermani-II and Hatgachi Gram Panchayats of \nSandeshkhali-I Block of North 24 Parganas District.\nThus, the project has immense potential for scaling up and replication in other \nsocio-economically vulnerable regions of West Bengal.\nCPF\u2019s Role\nThe organization works with community institutions and capacitates them in \nappropriate skills as well as federates them at different levels for reaping \ncollective advantages with regard to accessing their rights on forest resources \nand supports them in sustainable natural resource management including \nforest resources. Sustainable extraction of Non timber forest produce, value \naddition at the community level, participatory resource monitoring, water \nresource development, facilitating agro ecological practices in their lands, and \nhelping them to access entitlements and proper services from the government \ndepartments are some of the activities the organization undertakes, to address \nthe problems of the communities.\nWhile recognizing that women lack decision making and negotiation skills, \nmobility, identity and self -esteem and access to and control over resources \nand assets, CPF focuses on building their leadership through all its \ninterventions.\nPrimary stakeholders are the tribal and resource poor communities who \nmostly belong to the small and marginal farmer category\nSecondary stakeholders are the various government departments, traders and \nother service providers (who are engaged to provide certain services to the \ncommunity).\n1. Formation and strengthening the village level institutions/groups\na. Formation and strengthening of Tribal Farmers Service Centre \n(TFSC)\nOak Application Form     10\nThe Tribal Farmer\u2019s Service Centres will be formed with two representatives \nfrom each small group as committee members. CPF ensures that 50 percent \nare women in these committees with leadership role in the committee. The \ncenters are managed by the committee and they provide services viz., \nKnowledge services, information about government schemes, providing \nagricultural implements on minimum rental basis. The amount collected will \nbe used to sustain the Centre. Major Implements will be purchased with minor \ncontribution from the project farmers.\nb. Formation and strengthening of Village Coordination Groups (VCGs)\nCPF initiated a concept called Village Coordination Groups (VCGs) during the \nyear 2016. In the VCGs, two members from each of the existing CBOs (one \nfemale and one male) are grouped at the habitation level along with Sarpanch \nand one ward member. The purpose is to facilitate to access entitlements to \nall eligible individuals and also seek support for community needs. Awareness \nregarding various new government schemes, policies for tribals including \nForest Rights Act also discussed in the VCGs. VCG meets once in a month and \ndiscusses about the follow-up to be done with regard to the access/petitions \nsubmitted. It not only supports the individual CBOs on issues identified but \nalso discusses about the community level issues and requirements such as \u2013 \nrepair to PHC centre, approach road, drinking water etc.\nAt each of the 37 project habitations VCGs will be formed. Women \nrepresentatives from CBOs will become leaders in the VCGs formed. Thus, \nVCG will contribute in filling the gap between the communities, Panchayats \nand block officials.\nThe VCGs provide services to all eligible households (as per baseline) access \ndifferent government schemes of West Bengal like Khadya Saathi Scheme \n(RKSY-1 & 2), Duara Sarkar (campaign on 18 schemes with delivery at door \nstep) etc., and Community level entitlements.\nActivities\n1.

COOPERATION": "8. COOPERATION  \nHow will you involve others in your approach to achieving change? If you are \nplanning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived \nexperience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  \nWhy are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are \nchoosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you \nusually work? (300 words):\nParticipation and collaboration is central to the way CPF functions. CPF \nfollows a constructive, critical and collaborative approach with Communities \nand CSOs for implementing all its activities and projects. Depending on the \nnature of intervention, CPF had sought / worked with experts, academic \ninstitutions and networks. This has helped in not only realising project goals \nbut also established CPF as a transparent organisation.\nIn West Bengal, CPF had already began its interactions with relevant \nstakeholders including government as it is paramount in the smooth \ngrounding of project interventions. Through the scoping study, Pradan which \nis working in the Bankura district is identified as a possible collaborator for \nlivelihood interventions and discussions were held with their team in this \nregard. Besides this, other CSO representatives were consulted extensively to \nunderstand the relevant issues and the proposal was vetted seeking their \ninputs. Consultations with various stakeholders will be continued.\nOne of the major stakeholders in implementation of the project are the local \ngoverning bodies including the gram panchayats. The project envisions to \nengage gram panchayats at various levels of the project especially in providing \naccess to rights and entitlements to the project communities. The various \ngovernment departments especially the agriculture department, panchayat \nand rural development department will be engaged in leveraging the \ngovernment schemes and programs that aligns with the project objectives. The \nproject will engage with organisations providing research and extension-based \nservices such as Krishi Vignana Kendra (KVK).

MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING \nThis section is twofold. Please tell us:\na) Monitoring and evaluation. How will you know if you are achieving your objectives? Please \ndescribe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is working. \nIf you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or \nconduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.\nb) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or \ntest through this grant.\n(300 words):\nPlanning, Monitoring and Evaluation system of CPF are based on participatory \napproaches. The project monitoring system is built on expected outcomes and \nimpact. It assists in tracing the project progress towards achieving the \nobjectives and undertake mid-term corrections as required.\nBefore grounding the project, baseline survey will be undertaken and MIS \ndeveloped accordingly. The monitoring formats are designed as per outcome \nindicators. The project information is collected at regular intervals and \nmaintained. The quality of data collection is ensured by the Project officers in \nthe field and later analyzed by the MIS Officer. This is reviewed in a timely \nmanner by the program team. The analyzed reports are shared with \nstakeholders.\nQualitative indicators are captured and documented through regular \nmonitoring visits by project implementing team and Senior Management \nTeam. Monthly planning and review meetings are held at field office and also \nat Head Office for all the projects. Mid-term and end term evaluation of the \nprojects are being done as per the donor requirement and also keeping in view \nlong term vision of the organization.\nLearning: \nOver two decades, while implementing the projects, it was understood that \nforest-based livelihoods alone are not sufficient for enhancing incomes and \nconserving natural resources. CPF moved towards promoting agro-ecological \npractices, horticulture and water resource development. Tribal communities \nwere unable to access basic services and social security schemes because of \nremoteness and apathy of officials. This led CPF to work with communities and \nthe government on entitlements and sustainable NRM based livelihoods \nthrough community-based institutions.\nThrough this grant opportunity from the Oak Foundation to work in the regions \nof physical and socio-economic vulnerabilities of West Bengal, CPF is hoping \nto establish that its approach of enhancing income, access to entitlements and \npromoting agro-ecological practices though community-based institutions in \nforest fringe villages can be replicated.  \nOak Application Form     15", "10.

Are you planning a direct baseline commissioned by CPF or \nwould it be established through existing secondary data?\n \nQuestions raised by Trustee, President and Director-India Programme\nWhat were the factors that led to the collapse of the networks that \nexisted in West Bengal 5-6 years ago?\nWest Bengal has not been identified as a tribal state with the tribal population \nof about 5% of the total population. NGOs who are working with tribals are \nfocusing on health, education and livelihoods in a welfare approach rather than \nrights approach. In Sundarbans area the government is focusing on \ndevelopment based on tourism and environment. Sundarbans area because of \nits porous borders with Bangladesh the cross-border influx of the population \nhas become a security concern for the government and resulting in \ndiscouraging the civil society engagement in the region.\nWhat would be unique value add of Centre for People\u2019s Forestry in \nWest Bengal? How will it contribute to the work of other \norganizations currently working in West Bengal on the same issue?\nThe unique value addition of CPF in West Bengal is its collaborative approach \nin planning its   interventions involving consultations with all the stakeholders. \nCPF share its plans and budgets with the government and other stakeholders \nto mitigate the misconceptions that people have about the financial \nOak Application Form     18\ntransparency and in the process CPF gains the trust of the government and \nother stakeholders.  \nDepending on the nature of intervention, CPF works with experts, academic \ninstitutions and CSO networks. CSO representatives were consulted \nextensively to understand the relevant issues in West Bengal and the proposal \nwas vetted seeking their inputs. Consultations with various stakeholders will \nbe continued.  This approach helps CPF in realizing the project goals and also \nestablishes CPF as a transparent organization ensuring the CSOs engage with \nCPF to achieve the common goals by sharing the collective as well as the \nspecialized capacities of all involved stakeholders.\nCPF worked with 52 NGOs and Vanasmakhya - network of 680 Vana \nSamrakshana Samitis while facilitating Joint Forest Management and \nCommunity Forest Management in undivided Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.\nCPF would network with organization working for tribals and their \nentitlements in West Bengal also with the vast experience it has gained over \nthe years.\nWhy does CPF wish to work in West Bengal; how well is CPF placed in \nterms of connections with key departments, peers, staffing etc.? What \nare some of the factors you consider key for CPF to successfully \nestablish the work in West Bengal?\nCPF has been aiming to work towards restoration of the forest ecosystem in \nthe Eastern Ghats[1]. In the process, organization is expanding its \noperational areas and CPF chose to work in West Bengal for the same \nreason. Because of CPF work earlier with Forest Department, we could easily \nestablish contacts with the Forest Department and also with other \ndepartments in West Bengal.\nWhile doing the scoping study, CPF contacted IBRAD, PRADAN, CRY, Oxfam \u2013 \nIndia, CINI, EKJUT, WWF, and researchers working in West Bengal to \nunderstand the tribal livelihoods and also the civil society and government \nengagement on entitlements.\nCPF has well experienced team to ground a project of this scale and nature in \nother states and who can mentor the new recruits and provide necessary hand \nholding support to them. CPF Trustees with varied experience in forestry, \nenvironment, climate change, livelihoods and entitlements will guide us in \ngrounding and implementation of the project.\nAre you expecting other funders to co-fund during the four years of this \nrequest?\nYes, but not in the first two years of the project. The present BftW supported \nproject cycle is coming to closure by 2024. We will begin the dialogue with \nthem to support part of our West Bengal work from now onwards.

(300 words)\nMission:\nAangan strengthens child protection systems to ensure vulnerable children \nare supported to stay in school, protected from trafficking, child marriage, \nhazardous work, violence, and exploitation. Our 5-year goal is to make \nchildren\u2019s safety a crosscutting issue across sectors.\n \nHistory:\n2002-2013: Working with child survivors in state-run rescue homes (CCIs). \nUsing a first of its kind Monitoring Tool co-created with UNICEF India we \naudited CCIs across 16 states to provide strategic inputs on improving \nstandards of care.  Here we understood the importance of preventing harm at \nthe source and started shifting focus accordingly.\n2009-2015: Understanding that vulnerable children came from vulnerable \nfamilies and communities, we initiated community-based programs for \nchildren, working with families and local authorities, starting in Mumbai and \nexpanding across Maharashtra, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal, and Uttar \nPradesh.\n2015-2017: This culminated in PACT Parents and Children against \nTrafficking/Harm ) program that trained community women and leveraged \ntheir knowledge to prevent child harm in their communities with a 360-degree \nview of child safety.\n2018-2022: Building on PACT \u2013 Hotspot to Safe-spot was a district-wide \ndemonstration model in 5 districts (Rajasthan, Bengal, Jharkhand, UP, Bihar), \nbringing community women volunteers and key authorities (police, education, \nurban administration) together to create regular dialogue platforms focused \non child safety. These resulted in strategies like regular community safety \naudits shared with police; a family follow-up system for irregular/absent school \nchildren; maintaining migrating family registers with GPs.\n \nAchievements:\n\u2022Successful Advocacy with Government:\noThe state-wide Suraksha Sakhi scheme launched by Rajasthan Police in \n2021, is an expansion of Aangan's child-oriented community policing \nmodel demonstrated in Bharatpur.\n\u2022Child Safety through the HotSpot to Safespot Model\n\u2022Community volunteers across 5 districts gathered hyperlocal child harm \nand risk data that informed targeted interventions implemented with \nauthorities that led to ~19K school re-enrolments and averting ~1,600 \nchild marriages\nOak Application Form     7\n5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? \nHow will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and \ndecide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nGlobal evidence suggests that vulnerable groups such as children are at \nheightened risk of being exploited in the aftermath of climate disasters. \nAccording to ILO, 70 million children are impacted by climate disasters \nglobally every year.[1] Losses incurred during disasters often push families \ntowards dangerous adaptive strategies - migration, taking children out of \nschool, marrying them off, sending them to work, etc. These survival \nmeasures, along with the impact of disaster itself profoundly impacts a \nchild's life, exposing her to a plethora of immediate and long-term risks. \nMoreover, if the frequency of disasters is high, the cycle of risks \nperpetuates. \n \nWest Bengal, with a history of climate vulnerability and 15 districts \nsusceptible to extreme climate events, has witnessed multiple risk cycles. \nThe issue that was alarming to begin with has been exacerbated owing to \nrapid climate change. Since 2019, Bengal has faced three major tropical \ncyclones - Bulbul, Amphan and Yaas.\n \nAangan has worked in N 24 Parganas since 2017, demonstrating a \ncommunity-based child harm prevention model to address child trafficking, \nchild marriage and child labour, issues already established as endemic to the \narea. We work closely with community women volunteer groups who gather \nhyperlocal data and information and work with stakeholders and families on \nfinding solutions. We are therefore privy to how child harm and risks are \nexacerbated manifold because of the frequent recurrence of serious climate \nevents in this region and have also worked with community groups towards \nsolutions. Our experience shows:\n \nMedium to Long-term aftermath of disasters on families and children:\noDegradation and salinity of agricultural land and coastal erosion has \nforced changes in livelihood and sustenance patterns and loss of \nlivelihood leading to migration (sometimes leaving children behind) \nand increased child labour: In a joint initiative with GPs, 14744 families \nwere identified by community groups as being forced to migrate for \nwork and were provided with key information about safe practices\noChildren dropping out of school and a change in perception of the \nrelevance of education: 7972 children at risk of dropping out were \nsupported with remedial classes and re-enrolled in school\nOak Application Form     8\noIncreased child marriages: community groups prevented 429 child \nmarriages\noChild labour \u2013 children are entering the work force younger and are \nalso in hazardous work: 10698 children in or at risk of child labour \npulled out of child labour and linked back to school\noAnecdotal data from community women and from children (particularly \ngirls) points to an increase in trafficking in the guise of offers for \nmarriage and work\noIncrease in the number of child-headed families: 589 child-headed \nfamilies were identified and brought under the supervision of \ncommunity groups\n \nState governments set operational priorities during disaster response which \ndetermine the allocation of resources and response strategies for the whole \nstate. Within this its particularly important for the approach at the district-\nlevel to be sensitive to the needs of children.  Unfortunately, this is not the \ncase.\n \nState and district-level disaster management plans in Bengal don\u2019t say much \nabout children. In S24 Parganas plans there is mention of a need for \npsychological support to vulnerable groups including children, and the N24 \nParganas plans briefly mention children as a group in reference to disaster \nawareness and preparedness drives at schools (pre-disaster) and food and \nclothing requirement at the relief camps (post-disaster). Child and women's \nsafety are briefly referred to under Law and Order Safety Measures. \n \nOur experience shows its urgent that child protection work be embedded \ninside resilience building and risk reduction as a part of addressing climate \nchange. This is the gap we seek to address\n \n[1] https://www.ilo.org/manila/public/pr/WCMS_558093/lang--en/index.htm", "6. PLACE HOLDER": "6. PLACE HOLDER", "7. OBJECTIVES": "7.

The Occurrence of Serious Climate Events: this is always a possibility \nas this is an extremely high-risk region. As our experience shows, this \nchanges or at least delays project plans as the work on the ground \nnecessarily shifts focus to crisis management. Year 1 needs community \nengagement which is not at all feasible should such an issue arise. The tragic \nflip side is of course that one gets to build evidence- it just may not be with \ncommunity involvement.\n \n2. Community Push-back: Many child harms that occur are a result of \nsurvival strategies families adopt \u2013 for example child labor, or leaving \nchildren without appropriate care due to migration. Communities are more \nable to have these honest conversations when real alternatives exist. \nSometimes these are possible through linkage to state support, schemes and \nprograms \u2013 these are strategies that we have used in the past and will use \nagain. They require government cooperation too- which can also be tricky to \nnegotiate, especially if it is not an area of the government\u2019s focus.\n \n3. Lack of Interest from State/District: The State\u2019s buy-in will depend on \nhow relevant the issue of child protection is for them, especially true for \n2023-24 in the run-up to the general election. This will also impact what they \nprioritize in the district with regard to schemes and services. Availability of \npanchayats and local officials may also be affected.

Since inception DISHA has been active on different issues concerning \nenvironment, environmental health and human rights.\nSince 2000 DISHA has been involved in protection of coastal environment on \nthe issues of beach protection, destruction of fish resources, protection of \nmarine bio-diversity, unscrupulous tourism, unsafe industrialization, etc. \nDISHA started working with the traditional small scale fishing \ncommunitieswho are the natural custodians of coasts and protect \nenvironment for their livelihood through sustainable fishing. Three key \nachievements in fisheries sector -\n\u2022Since 2003 DISHA became involved in protection of bio-diversity in \nSundarban and livelihood of the fisher people who depend upon forest \nresources since ages. Later the issue of implementation of Forest Rights \nAct was taken up. DISHA conducted a study in 2009 on the Livelihood \nProblems of Traditional Fishers in Protected Area \n(www.dishaearth.org). Since 2012, DISHA became involved with inland \nfisheries. Policy issues like tenure rights of the small fishers, protection \nof their livelihood, saving the water bodies were taken up. DISHA started \nadvocating for policies at both national and state level in favour of small-\nscale fishers for sustainable use of fisheries resources.\nOak Application Form     7\n\u2022At the ground level DISHA had been engaged in organising and \nsupporting fish workers\u2019 collectives in nine southern districts of West \nBengal viz., Dakshin 24 Parganas, Uttar 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly \nand Purba Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, Jhargram, Nadia, \nMurshidabad. In North Bengal DISHA is engaged in supporting \ncollectivization of small-scale fish workers in 5 districts - Malda, Uttar \nDinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Coochbehar and Alipurduar.

(300 words):\nKABIL is governed by a Governing Board having distinguished professionals. \nThe eight honorary members on the Board function in their personal \ncapacities. Executive Director of KABIL, the ninth member, acts as the ex-\nofficio secretary. 3 of the eight honorary members are women. The Executive \nDirector of KABIL was conferred the \u201cDistinguished Alumnus\u201d award by the \nIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur last year.\nKABIL follows a flat hierarchy. The Executive Director is the first employee of \nthe organisation. Other employees are appointed by him. The programme \nOak Application Form     6\ndirector (level 3) reports to the Executive Director, the project leader (Level \n2) reports to the Programme Director and the executive (level 1) reports to \nthe project leader. While the category of professionals ends here, some \nassociates assist in different functions. It is a policy in KABIL that as far as \npossible professional staff will directly engage with the communities and there \nare no positions in between. When necessary, however, volunteers are \nrecruited temporarily, a recent instance being the COVID vaccination \nprogramme.\nCurrently, KABIL has 20 full-time staff. 12 of them are in the professional \ncategory and the rest eight are associates. In addition, 3 experts work on a \nretainer basis, providing part of their time for KABIL. The Executive Director \nhas more than three decades of experience in rural development. The experts \nhave a similar experience span. Among other professional staff, experience \nvaries between seventeen years and one year. While KABIL has no written \ndown policy to increase diversity or advance race equity, we consciously \npromote these while recruiting staff. 9 of the twenty full-time staff are women. \nThe staff hail from different regions of the country, and they belong to three \nreligions.\nThere is a possibility of the current Executive Director superannuating \nduring the proposed project period and a new incumbent taking over.\n 5b. Summarise the organisation\u2019s history.  In addition, highlight 2-3 key \nachievements.\nPlease keep this brief and list up to 3 key achievements as bullet points. Even though \nyou may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the \nproposed grant. (300 words)\nKABIL was incorporated at the end of 2012 and started its operations in early \n2014. During the first four years, KABIL provided on-site project \nimplementation support to other organisations for livelihood enhancement of \nthe rural poor. Concentrating in North-east India, it provided such support to \nother NGOs and the NERLP (World Bank funded).  It also trained all the \nfrontline functionaries of the Government of Jharkhand on livelihood \npromotion through natural resource management (NRM). KABIL currently \nworks with the Assam State Rural Livelihoods Mission, Government of Assam \n(ASRLM) to promote climate-resilient livelihoods for members of women\u2019s self-\nhelp groups in Udalguri district of Assam. It works in Tikamgarh of Madhya \nPradesh to develop water resources for livelihood promotion. It also works \nwith NGOs in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan to harness \nMahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) for \ndurable individual asset creation.\nSome salient achievements include:\n1. Popularising micro-irrigation pumps among smallholders in rural \nKamrup of Assam\n2. Facilitating as many as 702 individual livelihood assets in the form of \nfarm ponds and pigsties harnessing INR 8.58 Crore (USD 1.13 million) \nfrom the MGNREGS for an equal number of rural beneficiaries in a \nOak Application Form     7\nsingle community development block (Udalguri) over 4 years (2018-22). \nIn this project, as per a recent sample survey, out of the 1920 households \nwith whom at least three livelihood interventions were made, 59% \nincreased their annual income between 1 lakh and 1.49 lakh because of \nproject interventions.\n3. There is more demand now for KABIL from the Government. The ASRLM \nhas invited KABIL to provide design and implementation support for \ntheir Integrated Farming Cluster Programme, The District \nAdministration of Udalguri has asked KABIL to expand its activities to \ndifferent blocks and the District Administration of Tikamgarh (Madhya \nPradesh) has invited KABIL to become their technical support agency.\n5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? \nHow will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and \ndecide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nWe want to address the problem of livelihood and income vulnerability of tea \ngarden families in the closed and sick tea gardens of West Bengal. The \nmajority of the tea garden workers are Adivasis (Scheduled Tribes) who are \nsocially at the margins too. while the condition of workers across tea gardens \nis far from satisfactory, the vulnerability is acute in the closed and sick tea \ngardens.\nThe problem was identified through our understanding of poverty pockets in \nWest Bengal and two exploratory visits by us to the proposed project area. We \ndiscussed the problems and issues with the communities, government officials, \nelected representatives of the local self-government institutions and leaders \nof the tea garden workers. Secondary information, research etc. were also \nconsulted. For example, Sengupta, Naskar and Datta (March 2021) describe \nthe historical context of the current condition of the tea workers. Bera (2014) \ndescribes the poverty in the particular areas we visited and the more than \n1000 reported starvation deaths since 2002. Ansari and Sheereen  (2016) \ndescribe the vulnerability of tea workers when a tea garden is locked out or \nthe work is temporarily suspended.\nOur first-hand information indicates the following:\nMost of those who are still employed work as temporary workers. The most \nthey can expect is 132 days of work in a year at Rs 202 per day. The rest is \nearned through other casual means. Migration is common. Except for those \nwho migrate to places like Kerala or find occasional work through MGNREGS, \nthe wages earned are always less than tea garden wages. Finding menial jobs \nin the nearby towns is another commonly used means. Facilitated by labour \ncontractors, younger women and men, many of them school dropouts, travel \nlong distances regularly to functioning tea gardens and other places to do \nwage work. Labour contractors take their commission from these wage \nearners. There is a significant transport cost and time involved in travel. Jobs \navailable in other tea gardens are the ones which the local workers of the tea \nOak Application Form     8\ngarden would not prefer. Collecting stones and boulders from the nearby \nriverbanks and selling them to middlemen is a common occupation. Stone and \nboulder collection is a hard job and can at best earn Rs 150 (USD 2) a day. \nFarming and animal husbandry in the homesteads supplement income. All \nthese together can earn a family Rs 50,000 on average.  \nThe government is using MGNREGS to provide wages to tea garden families. \nThere is also a \u201cFoula\u201d system in the closed tea gardens through which the \nState Government pays Rs 1,500 (USD 20) per month to only the erstwhile \npermanent workers till they attain the age of 58.\nMany of the dwelling units of the tea garden families, which were built by the \ntea garden management decades back, are in dilapidated condition in the \nabsence of repair. Electricity and water, which were earlier provided by the \ntea garden are no longer available from them in the closed tea gardens. In the \nsick ones, the services often get interrupted because of payment and other \nissues. In closed tea gardens like Surendranagar and Redbank, the tea \nplantation area has turned into jungles. This has increased the menace of \nelephants.\nThrough this project, we specifically attempt to enhance the income equity of \nthe tribal and other vulnerable populations in the tea gardens who remain at \nthe margins. We also attempt to foster gender equality and inclusion of women \nby working predominantly with women and their groups which enhances their \ndecision-making space and leadership.", "6.

Facilitating the SHGS/community groups through participatory \nprocesses to visualise a better future for them, explore different \nlivelihood options, and plan for improved/new livelihood initiatives\ne. Helping the families to implement their livelihood plans. Initially, the \nfocus would be on stabilizing and scaling up the existing activities of \nlivestock rearing and backyard poultry that are most widespread. The \nsecond set of activities would focus on using the homestead lands for \nimproved cultivation of vegetables and other cash crops. Fallow lands \nwhich are part of the tea garden area will be made suitable for cropping \nthrough land and water development. Attempts will be made to use the \nshade trees in the plantation area for cash cropping like black pepper \n(no outputs are committed).\nf. Setting up demonstrations and providing critical gap-filling financial \nsupport to the families to initiate new/improved livelihood activities\ng. Helping the SHGs to leverage finances from the government (notably \nMGNREGS) and financial institutions for land and water development \nand meeting other requirements of livelihood development of the \nfamilies.  \nh.

If you are \nplanning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived \nexperience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  \nWhy are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are \nchoosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you \nusually work? (300 words):\nOak Application Form     11\nThe project is by its very nature a collaborative one. Outcomes cannot be \nachieved without the involvement of stakeholders. As we explored the area, \nwe introduced ourselves and discussed the problems and issues with the \ngovernment functionaries, the elected representatives of the local self-\ngovernment institutions, and leaders of the tea workers\u2019 trade unions. As a \nresult, we were introduced to the communities by the government \nfunctionaries working in the respective blocks.\nAs we venture into the project, we would also explore collaboration with \npartners of Oak Foundation. We understand that some of them operate in the \narea or are planning to operate. In addition to gaining insights from them, we \nalso expect great complementarity and further energizing of the initiatives of \nall the concerned partners.\nA collaboration with West Bengal State Rural Livelihood Mission will be much \nsought after because the women\u2019s SHGs promoted by them are expected to be \nan important platform for action. KABIL is already working with the State \nRural Livelihood Mission in the adjoining state of Assam and has gained \nexperience in collaboration with such an entity.\nFinancial institutions like banks and market actors will have to be tapped. \nCommunities need access to credit for their livelihood initiatives; they also \nrequire input and output linkages with the market. Relevant industry bodies \nlike the India Tea Association will be consulted on issues and their cooperation \nwill be sought.\nLast but not least, we do realise that the situation in the tea gardens is complex \nand more insight is needed. There are many academics and there is a wealth \nof research on issues in tea gardens. It will be our constant endeavour to seek \ninput from academics and available knowledge.", "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING \nThis section is twofold. Please tell us:\na) Monitoring and evaluation. How will you know if you are achieving your objectives? Please \ndescribe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is working. \nIf you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or \nconduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.\nb) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or \ntest through this grant.\n(300 words):\nAs mentioned earlier, by end of the project period, 2,500 households are \nexpected to earn Rs. 25,000 additional income over the current mean income \nof Rs 50,000. This is done in a way that includes women and sustainability is \nensured. The outcome assessment will be done at the end of the project \nthrough an evaluation to be undertaken by a competent third party.\nWe plan to conduct a baseline survey of the area while initiating the project. \nData regarding the livelihood status of individual families will also be captured \nas they enter the project. These will act as the benchmark. An M&E framework \nincluding MIS will be developed for this project as we begin. Progress \nOak Application Form     12\nparameters will be captured on an ongoing basis through the MIS. Some of the \nindicators for measurement on a periodic basis include:\n\u2022Number of SHGs/community groups that KABIL is working with\n\u2022Number of livelihood plans made by them\n\u2022Volume of finance leveraged by the groups\n\u2022Number of groups monitoring the implementation of the livelihood plans\n\u2022Number of households adopting improved livestock rearing and/or \nhomestead garden practices\n\u2022Area covered by natural resource development interventions\n\u2022Additional land area brought under cultivation\n\u2022Cash crops introduced\n\u2022Income realized by the families due to project interventions, etc.\nSample surveys and case studies will be undertaken at the end of each year \nand reported.\nUnlike in most cases where agri-based interventions are done on land \nbelonging to the households, in this project the land does not belong to \nthem.  The most important area of learning for us will be how to work in tea \ngardens and the tea garden community benefit from the development of land \nthat does not belong to them.  This is a new area for KABIL and this grant \nallows the testing of this assumption.", "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGES\nWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your \noutcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?\nWe understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we \nexpect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be \nopen to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your \noutcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? \n(300 words):\nThe risks are as under:\na. The closed tea gardens have no current owners. So no consultation with \nthe owners is possible for the activities on tea garden lands. If and when \nnew owners are found by the government, they may not allow cultivation \nactivities on those lands. We understand that finding owners for these \ntea gardens is difficult because of the deteriorated plantations and \nseveral pending court cases. Nevertheless, the project will remain in \ntouch with the government so that any new negotiation accommodates \nthe changed reality of the gardens. \nb. Elections in the local self-government institutions (PRIs) are due in May \n2023. Any change in political composition thereafter can impede the \nOak Application Form     13\nrelationship. To circumvent this, the project will make its apolitical \nstance explicit before all stakeholders.\nc. Allocation under MGNREGS may be reduced by the central/state \ngovernments which will adversely affect fund leverage. In such a \nscenario, the project will have to tap other schemes and sources to \ncompensate for the reduction.\nd. The women\u2019s SHGs formed by the Livelihood Mission may not be in a \ngood shape to work with. In an extreme scenario, the Mission may not \nallow the project access to the SHGs. While we have a prima facie \nassurance from the local government functionaries that the project can \nwork with the SHGs, it may have to put in additional effort to first \nstrengthen the SHGs to work with them.\nThe opportunities include a) a huge area of uncultivated lands which can be \nutilized for cultivation purposes, b) the government\u2019s concern about the \nwellbeing of the workers of the closed tea gardens c) Good road connectivity \nd) high rainfall in the area that creates a high potential for water harvesting \ne) Tea (Promotion and Development) bill 2022 which aims at improving the \ntea industry, etc.", "11.

What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nThe Sundarbans\u2019 ecosystem is one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems of \nthe Indian Sub-continent. The UNESCO designated world heritage site plays a key \nrole as the region\u2019s carbon sink soaking in around 4.15 crore tonnes of carbon \ndioxide (2011). However, the region\u2019s rich bio-diversity and burgeoning human \npopulation stand at a brink today with increasing threats to their very existence \nfrom exogenous climate induced shocks and its aftereffects.\n \nThe principal land-based livelihoods get impacted due to increased salinity, lack of \nknowledge with regard to sustainable agriculture, no options for diversified \nagriculture etc. due to which more and more people are exploiting the natural \nresource base in a manner that will be difficult to sustain over the long run. \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\nFrequent climatic hazards (saline flood, cyclone etc) are disrupting the livelihood \nover and above. Agricultural lands are being converted into prawn farming ponds \n(Bheri) which is again not sustained livelihood option at all.\n \nThe proposed interventions will be emphasized on orientation on different \ntechniques and methods of climate adaptive agriculture, livestock farming, \naquaculture, and other on-farm and non-farm income generation programmes \nwhich ultimately will help the community to diversify their income opportunities \nand thereby will lead to increase climate resilience. The interventions will consist \nof establishing seed banks through which the targeted households will be able to \nconserve salt-tolerant seeds for future, they will be able to learn to prepare \nnutrition gardens at each and every possible space they have around their \nhomestead to get assured nutrition with their daily meals round the year. The \nbiggest problem of Sundarbans, river bank erosion will be tried to be addressed \nthrough plantation of mangroves and protecting those plants to reduce the \nproblem. Rain water will be harvested through different rain water harvesting \nstructures which may help in increasing the availability of irrigation during the \nstress period. The facilities will be established so that the increased production of \nthe farmers can be aggregated, value added and marketed through a cluster based \napproach.\n \nThe proposed intervention aims at addressing the non-availability of a facilitative \nplatform for vulnerable people in the Sundarbans to come together, diagnose their \nvulnerabilities and act upon the same. Such a platform has been elusive on \naccount of high opportunity cost of participation of vulnerable groups in processes \nof development, lack of any favourable prior experiences, and increasing alienation \nfrom their core habitat and livelihoods.", "7.

The work will be undertaken \nacross 35 gardens of which 25 gardens in North Bengal and 10 gardens in Assam.\n \nTea worker communities constitute one of the most isolated and marginalised \ncommunities amongst various plantation workers. Having been uprooted from \ntheir native places, their lives across generations have remained confined to \ngardens with limited interaction with outside communities. Being under the sole \nauthority of respective garden management, the workers have little security and \nsafety nets other than those provided by Garden management, long working hours, \nlack of work security, low literacy and low skill sets have made this segment of \npopulation particularly marginalised, Further, this affects women and youth the \nmost in terms of poor health conditions of women, malnutrition amongst the \npopulation, disenchantment amongst youth. Most often young boys and girls, out of \nsheer desperation take risks of uninformed migration, falling victims to trafficking \nand other forms of abuse.\n \nThe project will be the first phase of a multi-phase intervention where the project \nwill facilitate building of community voices and create opportunities and choices \nfor Tea worker households. We have limited our intervention specifically to cover \nTea workers and to some extent workers in Small Tea Gardens who are relatives of \nworkers in Large and Closed Tea gardens. Small Tea Growers are not covered \nwithin the ambit of the current phase given their varied profile and more \nmainstream identity compared to workers in Tea estates who are covered under \nPlantation Labour Act. In this phase the primary focus will be to improve \nlivelihoods and safety nets through a participatory process of needs, resources, \nskills and opportunity identification leading to diversification and improvement in \nincomes. Secondly, collectivisation of women and youth in the gardens and \nenhancing their knowledge, skills and sense of agency will improve their \nnegotiation and dialogue capacities with officials within and outside the gardens \nenabling them to access entitlements from the Government. We see this as a \ncritical intervention towards Trade justice \u2013 which depends a lot of building \ncapacities of the community itself to identify and raise their issues and stand up for \ntheir own rights The project will also establish a model of climate adaptive \npractices through establishing small scale innovations in two Gardens and \nfacilitate formation of informal CSO group for peer to peer learning, broadbased \nunderstanding of Labour Code and its dissemination, joint assessment of advocacy \nissues and actions for policy.", "4.

All Directors \nare subject to re-election every three years, except the foundation Director (who is \nappointed by the Traidcraft Foundation. The board appoints the Chief Executive \nwho manages the day to day operations of the charity. We have women Board \nMembers and most members of our Senior Management Team (SMT) are women, \nincluding a woman CEO. The SMT meets regularly to monitor progress on our \nAnnual Plan and support the operations of the organization.\nThe number of full-time equivalent employees are 47 in Traidcraft Exchange \nacross five offices in the UK, South Asia and East Africa. There are approximately \n14 full-time equivalent staff employed in the headquarter office in Newcastle; 10 \npeople in the London office; 5 in the East Africa office in Kenya; 12 in the \nBangladesh office, and 6 in the India office. We have expertise and experience in \ntrade and market access, supporting women\u2019s economic empowerment and \nenvironmental sustainability in supply chains. With the recent strategic review \nprocess of Traidcraft and need for reorganising, the staff position might change in \nnear future. \n6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\nAs of 2019/20 Traidcraft Exchange had overall unrestricted reserves of \u00a3819k. We \nare expecting to at least break even at an operating level in 2020/21 and our \nbudget for 2021/22 shows operating costs of \u00a32.096m with income of circa \n\u00a32.14m. We currently have no long-term liabilities on our balance sheet and little \ncurrent debt.\n \nWe are currently going through a restructure, which is focusing on the \norganisation as a whole in order to cut costs but also to make us more efficient in \nraising funds from our existing donor base, including individual donors, trusts and \nfoundations and other philanthropists.\nIn terms of fundraising, we were quick to adapt to the Covid crisis and \nunrestricted fundraising efforts have weathered Covid restrictions well as the \ncharity has a fairly large, loyal donor base who have continued to give \nphilanthropically throughout the lockdown periods.\nOur public fundraising strategy seeks to focus resources on high return on \ninvestment, philanthropic activity such as appeals, regular giving and legacy. With \nregards our restricted funding strategy we currently operate an institutional \nfunding model whereby we seek funding from institutions such as Comic Relief, \nNational Lottery Community Fund, the UK government and the EU to fund \nprojects designed and delivered by Traidcraft Exchange in collaboration with local \npartners. However, the NGO and INGO funding landscape is shifting. We are \nseeking to adapt our current funding model in light of this and beginning in the \nnext financial year we will start to seek funding from a much broader range of \nfunders.\n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nTraidcraft Exchange (TX) was set up in 1986 by Traidcraft plc (established in \n1979) to provide an alternate route to trade where people are at the heart of trade. \nThrough its development programmes in South Asia and East Africa, and the \npolicy, lobbying & campaigning work in the UK/EU, Traidcraft has made a \ndifference to the lives of millions of people. Key achievements include:\n\u2022We have supported 500,000 producers across Asia and Africa to improve \nproductivity, market access, particularly for vulnerable communities like \nwomen, ethnic minorities, youth and people with disability.\n\u2022We have set-up and promoted like-minded organisations including Shared \nInterest and Caf\u00e9 Direct.\n\u2022We have sourced over 1000 products from 30 countries across Asia, Africa \nand Latin America.\n\u2022We have pioneered at least 5 new Fairtrade certified products into the \nglobal Fairtrade system while supporting the Fairtrade Labelling \nOrganisation to develop and test product standards.\n\u2022We have demonstrated transparent operations through social accounting \nand publication of these reports.\n\u2022We were voted one of the most innovative charities in the UK; also receiving \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nawards on our policy & campaigning and public fundraising initiatives.\n\u2022TX\u2019s policy work led to the introduction of a supermarket ombudsman and \nGroceries Adjudicator to ensure adherence to a supply code of practice to \nbenefit workers. Traidcraft has policy expertise on purchasing practices, \ncorporate governance and accountability, fair and ethical trade, and \ninternational trade policy, including working with the UK government on \ntrade policies post Brexit. \n\u2022Our work in India has revolved around complex and labour-intensive value \nchains such as tea, textile, cotton and jute, supporting about 150,000 \nhouseholds. TX India has worked with a range of target groups, including \nwomen from ethnic minorities and tribes.\n\u2022In the tea sector for example, our work in India has benefited 70,000 small \ntea growers, with recognition of this sub-sector for the first time in the 11th \nFive Year Plan. We also supported the set-up of a Small Grower Directorate, \nthe formation of the Confederation of Small Tea Grower Associations, and \nthe co-option of Small Grower representatives on the Tea Board.\n\u2022\u201cWho Picked My Tea\u201d campaign facilitated by Traidcraft enabled the tea \nsector to move from complete silence over sourcing to gaining increased \ntransparency in the tea sector in the UK enabling consumers to track the tea \nthey drink from leaf to cup.\n\u2022We are currently implementing the \u201cPahadiya Samriddhi\u201d project in \nJharkhand which aims to reduce vulnerabilities of 3000 Pahariya (Primitive \nTribe) households by providing better access to markets and improve \nmanagement of natural resources\n\u2022We launched the first fair trade label in India called \u2018Shop for Change\u2019 \nwhich is now managed by a private body, and our cotton project helped test \nthe first Fairtrade standards for cotton by the Fairtrade Foundation in the \nearly 2000s. Additionally, our work in the textiles sector has enabled the \n12th Five Year Plan to focus on the occupational health & safety of artisans.\n\u2022Currently, we are working with Adivasi and Dalit communities in Madhya \nPradesh to address the systemic and structural vulnerabilities of \nagricultural communities to forced, bonded and child labour. We support the \ncreation of alternate avenues of income generation, and of people\u2019s \ninstitutions that work together to prevent exploitation.\n\u2022We are also currently growing our expertise on modern slavery issues in \nagricultural supply chains, improved working conditions for invisible \nworkers in the textiles sector (particularly homeworkers), and the promotion \nof sustainable agriculture.\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nTraidcraft Exchange uses the power of trade to bring about lasting solutions to \npoverty. We are on the side of people who are most vulnerable in trade - \nmarginalised workers and producers whose work goes unseen and whose voices \ngo unheard. We aim to support the most vulnerable groups including women, \nethnic minorities and people with disabilities. \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\n \nTX is committed to transforming ourselves from a UK-centric model into a locally \nrooted, globally connected organisation.  Pursuing this model enables us to \ndevolve responsibility and decision-making to our in-country teams and beyond \nthat, to cede power to the producers and workers who we are supporting. The \noverarching aim is to put communities in the driving seat of decisions and \nprocesses related to their lives and livelihoods by using participatory \nmethodologies and listening to communities and partners. \n \nIn this context, Traidcraft Exchange\u2019s core purpose is to identify, support and \ninvest in farmer associations, worker collectives, social enterprises and civil \nsociety organisations that are challenging the negative impacts of mainstream \ntrade and developing alternative business models that put people and planet first. \nWe will be standing alongside communities who are vulnerable and have been \nmarginalised, supporting them to develop businesses that work for them, that \nprotect and respect their local eco-systems and that build their resilience. And in \ndoing this, we will support them to build their power. Our UK advocacy and \ncampaigns work will complement this work and be rooted in the lived experiences \nof farmers and workers and the priorities of advocacy partners in-country, \naddressing the systemic and structural issues affecting people\u2019s lives.\n \nFurther, some of the key lessons derived from our past work in the tea sector \n(including programmatic work in India and policy/ campaigning work in the UK \nlevel) that forms part of the strategy for this project are:\n\u2022Need to engage with multiple stakeholders (including the garden \nmanagement, supply chain actors, government institutions like tea Board, \nTRA) to be effective on-ground. We have planned for such engagements in \nthe current application, whereby we shall involve garden management team \nin specific workstream; and also plan to do dissemination events including \nmultiple stakeholders.\n\u2022Creating community-based platforms for sustaining work in future \nphase. In our work with small tea growers (STG), as part of the EqualiTea \nproject, we facilitated STG associations at ground level, including national \nlevel STG federation taking forward the work with relevant stakeholders. \nThese community institutions (associations and federation) are still active \nmore than a decade since the project timeframe. In the current programme \nplan, we have kept provision for creating community collectives of women \nand youth in the Tea garden communities. These community institutions will \nprovide us the platform for work in the next phase of programmes \n(especially as we tackle some of the sensitive issues such as human \ntrafficking and gender based violence in tea garden communities in future \nphase of work)   \nCampaigning and media engagement does help in highlighting key issues with \nbrands and buyers: Traidcraft policy and campaigning unit, continuously engage \nwith UK based consumers to pressurize brands and companies to adopt ethical \nsourcing practices. We have run effective campaigns for Tea sector (such as \n#WhopickedmyTea campaign; https://traidcraftexchange.org/tea-answers ) for \ngreater transparency in supply chains of leading UK based tea brands. We are \nlooking to take advantage of the network of our Policy unit to disseminate \ninformation about our project activities to a wider audience with reach to \ninternational brands and buyers.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nThe tea industry in India is the country\u2019s second largest employer in the formal \nsector. A large proportion of the tea produced in India comes from the four States \nof Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Directly and indirectly, the \nindustry employs over 3 million people, a majority of whom are women. Indian tea \nremains an important supplier to the global market even as the domestic \nconsumption base increases. Our study on the tea industry has focused on the \nconditions of workers in the tea gardens of Assam and West Bengal. The study \ncovered a total of 15 large tea estates (LTE); 23 small tea growers (STG\u2019s) and 6 \nclosed tea estates (CTE\u2019s) across the four clusters of Assam and West Bengal, \ninterviewing a total of 308 tea worker respondents. We have also sought to \nunderstand some of the challenges faced by the industry as a whole. We have \nscanned research reports on these topics from within the industry as well as from \nindependent academic researchers and institutions. We have also spoken to \nindustry leaders as well as civil society organizations working with tea workers. \nKey problems of the tea workers are:\nAlienation and Lost Identity: Most workers in the tea estates especially in \nAssam are descendants of workers who came to Assam under the indentured \nlabour arrangements of British India. They trace their roots to the Adivasi \nCommunities- mostly Mundas and Oraons of the Central India Belt- Odisha, \nJharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. Today they are recognized as \nTea and Ex \u2013 Tea Garden tribes and recognized as Other Backward Classes by the \nGovernment of Assam. In West Bengal, since Colonial times the workers were not \nindentured. Instead, plantation owners recruited them mostly from Nepal, with \nsome monetary compensation. Besides this, the workers are also santhals and \nadivasis from central India such as Oraons and Mundas. The incentives were \nmostly non-monetary in nature and included housing. These houses continued to \nbelong to the plantations and workers were only allowed to live and are expected \nto maintain the house for as long as they occupy them. Uprooted from their \noriginal roots, the workers are not connected to their social community. Living in \nisolated gardens with limited means of communication and exposure, most \nworkers live only as \u201cTea workers\u201d with other identities almost insignificant. \nAggravating this is the hostility and alienation faced from the natives of the state- \nespecially Assam due to which the Tea worker community face estrangement and a \nsense of lost identity.\nWorking conditions of workers: Our secondary research has brought up many \nindividual studies (Oxfam-2019, Banerji and Willoughby-2019, University of \nSheffield-2018, Behal-2017, CEE-2009), that describe the difficult living and \nworking conditions of tea workers. The colonial legacy of the industry continues to \ninform the relationship between the management of tea gardens and their \nworkers. The workers\u2019 unions that represent the workers\u2019 collective interests have \nbeen unable to represent these issues and have been vulnerable to the influences \nof mainstream political parties and estate management. The national laws \ngoverning the industry, specifically the Plantations Labour Act, 1951, have many \nenabling provisions but compliance monitoring is inadequate. The Act stipulates \nthat all tea estates shall provide to its workers amenities such a drinking water, \nseparate toilets, medical facilities, creches for child care, canteens, recreational \nfacilities, educational facilities and housing facilities. Our primary data suggests \npoor availability of these facilities across all categories of the tea gardens. Less \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201310\nthan a third of study participants reported satisfaction with the quality of the \nhousing they lived in. Drinking water is a serious issue in the gardens affecting \nwomen the most. Coupled with this, poor nutrition , very hard nature of work \nresult in health complications of women members in particular. The issue of low \nwages has been a consistent problem in the tea sector and has been a long-drawn \nstruggle for tea workers. The wages of tea estate works are neither aligned to \nMGNERGA norms nor anything in line with indices of the consumer price index. \nThe vulnerable workers often become victims of one upmanship between trade \nunions & employers who often work at cross purposes.            \nLack of awareness of workers and poor linkages to government schemes: \nOur study highlights low levels of awareness among workers. In responses to \nquestions about work promotions, only 7% of the participants in the LTE replied in \nthe affirmative. The issue of inadequate wages has been reported by many \nparticipants. However, only 27% of the participants showed awareness of regular \ndeductions from their wages. A third of the participants said that it was difficult to \naccess government schemes and within that group 50% are women.. The reasons \nthat they cited for this include the lack of awareness about the schemes, lack of \nnecessary documents and lack of timely information on the process to be followed, \ngeneral apathy of government officials towards tea worker community  \nLow family income, unemployment and underemployment: Low wages, poor \naccess to education and social differences with neighbouring communities have all \ncontributed to a poor capital accumulation within the tea workers community. \nMost of them do not possess land or if they do (as among the West Bengal tea \nworkers), it is just enough for homestead garden plots. Small livestock rearing is \nchallenging due to the lack of space and common land. Participants reporting \naccess to school beyond the primary level were only 18% of the sample and to high \nschool only2%. A little under half of the participants cite financial difficulties as \nthe reason for the discontinuation of their education. This circumstance has \nspawned several other social problems such as bonded labour, child labour, \ndestitution and trafficking of women and children. The nature of hiring workers \nwithin the tea industry & growing aspirations of youth creates a context of \nunderemployment and unemployment within the tea estates. This forces youth to \nmigrate out to urban centres in search of more gainful employment, often trapped \nand exploited by the traffickers.\nClimate and sustainability of the tea sector: On another front, the tea industry \nis vulnerable to climate change. Extreme climactic events affect both production \nand processing cycles of the tea crop. These changes in the meteorological factors \nhave also a negative impact on the number & severity of incidences of pests and \ndisease infestations, soil quality and soil erosion. If this trend continues, large \nparts where tea is grown currently will become unviable for commercial tea \nproduction in two to three decades. The industry is also facing multiple problems \nrelated to output price stagnation, higher factor costs of production, ageing of the \nbushes in the organized estates, labour shortages & absenteeism, regulatory \nhurdles, lack of policy support & reforms, current market structure & the gradual \nshifting of consumer preference towards other beverages.\n \nGiven the complex multi-layered issues of vulnerability among tea workers and the \ntea sector as a whole, a multi phased approach to ensure a sustainable \nintervention is required. This is intended to be the first phase of a multi-phase \nintervention, where an enabling eco-system for dialogue and mutual trust will be \nbuilt with the various stakeholders. This approach is informed by our \nunderstanding that to achieve any sustainable change in the lives of tea workers, \ninterventions will have to work at multiple levels of the worker communities, tea \nestate management as well as government. The projects aims to create win win \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201311\nsituation for workers, Garden management and Government by addressing \npractical issues like livelihood enhancement of workers, bridging entitlement \naccess gaps , demonstrating pilots for better living conditions in gardens through \nsolutions for drinking water etc. An enabling eco-system that includes \ncollaborative engagement will lead to improved and dignified quality of life of \nworkers in the long run.  We intend to play a catalytic role through establishing a \nmodel which engages various stakeholders and is guided by our own strength and \nmission of shifting the power in trade.\n \nIn the first phase 42 months, we propose to undertake entry point interventions \nwith large tea estates (LTE) and closed tea gardens (CTG)), that will address the \nissues of:\na) lacking skill & income enhancement opportunities for tea worker communities;\nb) Improve awareness and access to social entitlements through joint action \nbetween tea worker communities, tea garden management, government officials \netc.\nc) Address solidarity and Cooperation through mobilizing women and youth in the \nTea gardens for regular capacity building, information sharing and enhancing \ntheir role within the community;\nd) Pilot interventions to address Climate Change impacts in collaboration with Tea \nResearch Association and other multistakeholder forums like Trustea/ Trinitea etc.\ne) Create informal platform of likeminded CSOs and representatives of Tea worker \ncommunities working in tea sector with a view to learn and promote good \npractices and strengthen sectoral understanding on the issues of Tea workers and \nTea sector as a whole; and\nf) Build capacities of local partner organizations on facilitation skills, worker \nrights, skill trainings and migration so they can lead the change process in the \nfuture.\n \nIn the subsequent phases, besides broadening its intervention to gardens, the \nwork will build upon the stakeholder forums, community institutions and technical \ninnovations developed during this phase.  Intensive and deepened work around \nworking conditions and worker rights will be facilitated through constructive \ndialogue and consultations with the Tea estate managements and stakeholders \nforum. Simultaneously, issues of domestic violence against women, issues of \ntrafficking and safe migration for youth will be addressed upfront by the \nempowered community institutions built in this phase. Using its experience in \nConsumer and brand engagement, Traidcraft will also work towards raising \nconsumer awareness in domestic and international markets through campaigns \nand engage brands to adhere to transparency & ethical standards. Traidcraft will \nalso leverage its experience gained in working with Large Tea estates to promote \nSustainability standards by informing the Garden management on standards, \nfacilitating them in adoption of practices to qualify for standards like \nTrustea/Trinitea for the domestic tea industry and ensuring their accountability \nthrough transparent self-disclosures. The informal network of CSO\u2019s and \nlikeminded agencies, individuals, workers representatives etc. will be steered to \nevolve as a resource network for tea agencies/gardens and other CSOs to learn, \nensure that tea workers voices are amplified, promote best practices and engage \nin facilitating programs and funding. Traidcraft\u2019s new portfolio approach to work \non the issues of workers and Tea workers being one of the key programmatic \nfocus, will enable its long-term commitment to the issue and bring in additional \ninvestment for future phases and programming.                \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201312\n \nThe next sections in the document outline in detail the intervention plan for the \nCurrent phase.", "7. OBJECTIVES": "7. Objectives (maximum 2,200 words)\nFor a core support grant, state the purpose of this grant request and complete the \nobjectives.  After consultations with an Oak PO, you may decide to summarise your \nmission as one broad objective. In this case, it is still necessary to specify activities \nand results/outcomes for this objective.\nFor project support grants please list your objectives for this project in bullet point \nformat. (You may use additional space if you have more than three objectives)?. \nUnder each objective describe the activities that your organisation will undertake to \nachieve it, including time frame and the results or outcomes you expect to achieve.\n7.1.a. Objective 1 (maximum one sentence):\nStrengthened community groups of Women and Youth representing 9,000 tea \nworker households from 35 tea estates (Closed and Large Tea gardens; 10 in \nAssam and 25 in West Bengal) to access rights, schemes and entitlements through \nimproved awareness, leadership and joint action           \n7.1.c. Objective 1\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\nAccess to information and awareness of rights, government schemes and \nentitlements within the tea worker communities has been found to be quite poor, \npreventing many of the tea worker families to access the benefits of the schemes. \nTheir awareness related to the workers\u2019 rights has been also found to be quite low \nas only 9% of the tea workers working in the large tea estates responded that they \nwere aware of laws protecting their rights. As a result, uptake on social security \n7.1.b. Objective 1\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\nKey results achieved under this objective are:\na. 246 Women\u2019s Groups and 35 Youth forums demonstrate enhanced \nconfidence and leadership to access their rights and entitlements. About \n60% households in Assam and West Bengal (6600 HHs) will be linked to \nminimum 1 Government programs or entitlements.\nb. Garden management, Panchayats and Government working together with \nthe community groups to address the issues of access, quality & timeliness \nof entitlements     \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201313\nschemes, health and nutrition benefits is also low despite high levels of \nmalnutrition and poor health of women and children, Even in the closed tea \ngardens where the District Administration takes over the management and \nfacilitates these entitlements, most often lack of community demand and \nremoteness of the gardens, the workers are left out. On the other hand, \nunderemployment and unemployment of youth are on the rise which leads to \nforced migration. Most people migrate to other cities and states through local \nagents who promise them of lucrative opportunities which quite often becomes a \nvicious trap of exploitation. The primary research threw light on many cases of \ntrafficking that is on the rise. Cutting across these, is a deep sense of alienation \nand isolation of the community who are mostly tribal people with a colonial history \nof being uprooted from their original villages. Life in the tea gardens has not \nhelped in integration with the mainstream people of the West Bengal and Assam. \nThere is despondency and lack of agency which pushes them further to the \nmargins.\n \nHence, there is a need to collectivise and build on the community strength to exert \ntheir voice and improve awareness and knowledge on their rights and entitlements \nbesides nurturing their sense of community and leadership. \n \nThe activities will be done through a participatory approach with engagement and \nhandholding of women and youth to be able to lead their own pathway of change, \nexpand their networks and articulate their needs. Following are the key \nfoundational activities planned:\n \n1.Mobilising Communities \u2013 Women groups and Youth Forums: At the \noutset of the project, mapping of the 10 selected tea gardens in Assam and \n25 tea gardens in West Bengal to assess the status of the existing women\u2019s \ngroup formed in the past (as part of government initiatives) which now are \neither dysfunctional, inactive or weak will be undertaken.\nAlongside, youth in the tea gardens will also be mobilised and organised as \nyouth forums. These Youth forums will provide an open space to youth to \nexpress themselves, build their skills and engage in welfare of their community \nmembers. Through mobilising support from expert agencies, Traidcraft will \nbuild capacities of partners in developing a structured approach to youth \nengagement,\nDepending on their social cohesion, the community will be organised as per \ntheir settlement pattern \u2013 for example in Assam the women groups will be \norganised based on their labour lines (this is how housing is defined on tea \nestates); whereas in West Bengal, women will be organised considering the size \nof the group (30 women per group). A total of 246 Women\u2019s Groups (200 in \nWest Bengal, 46 in Assam) and 35 Youth forums (25 in West Bengal and 10 in \nAssam) will be formed in Year 1.\n2.Capacity Building and Awareness: Women\u2019s groups will be capacitated \non livelihood activities, nutrition and health, social security schemes etc, \nCapacity building of youth groups entail building soft skills, cultural identity, \nyouth and development, rights and entitlements, safe migration and career \ncounselling.. In order to build networks, relevant resource agencies and \ngovernment officials will be brought in to deliberate on the topic of their \nrelevance. The activity will be undertaken both on Year 1 and Year 2 \n3.Facilitation for access to Entitlements: Community institutions i.e. \nWomen\u2019s groups and Youth forums will be facilitated to support in accessing \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201314\nthe various entitlements and schemes.  This would include mapping the \nhouseholds eligible for social security, health and nutrition and other \nrelevant entitlements; assistance in registration, documentation etc. \nCommunity groups will also be supported to monitor the services of ICDS \nand Health centres and facilitated to liaise with the relevant authorities to \naccess quality services. The project will also facilitate setting up a \ncoordination committee at the block level engaging Panchayats and relevant \ngovernment departments to facilitate the access of various \nschemes.  Schemes and entitlements that would be facilitated are: a. \nPension schemes (example - National Old Age Pension, Widow Pension, \nArunodoi - financial assistance to women - widow, differently abled, \nunmarried, divorcee); Student scholarship & Financial assistance for \nstudents/youths for studies and self-employment; skill development \nprograms such as Swahid Dayal Das Panika Swaniyojan Achoni (specifically \ndesigned for the tea worker communities in Assam) etc.\n7.2.a. Objective 2 (maximum one sentence):\n3500 HHs (3000 HHs in West Bengal and 500 HHs in Assam) & 1500 youth (1000 \nin West Bengal and 500 in Assam) have increased resilience and choices through \nknowledge of improved practices, new skills, services and information thereby \nimproving their livelihood and income opportunities\n7.2.c. Objective 2\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\nOur primary study reveals that the incidences of underemployment, seasonal \nunemployment & permanent unemployment are very high among tea workers & \nyouth of the family. This is further aggravated by low wage rates, low levels of \nskills & lack of avenues for alternative employment. As per the study, on an \naverage a permanent worker in a tea garden worker earns ? 44,000/- per annum \nwith 271 working days; whereas a temporary worker in the garden earns ? \n31,300/- per annum with 187 working days. Further, the study highlighted that \n80% of the participants have been provided access to primary school for their \nchildren but access to the next stage of schooling is only 18% and under 5% report \naccess to secondary and higher secondary schools. Thus, the tea workers & youth \n7.2.b. Objective 2\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\na. 3500 Tea worker households have increased access to information, \nknowledge about improved farming and allied practices to diversify income. \nAbout 60% of the HH\u2019s will show 20-30% increase in their income\n1500 Youth from Tea worker community have increased opportunity for jobs or \nenterprise through improved knowledge and skills on specific market-oriented \ntrade. About 50% of the trained youth who are placed/started their enterprise \ncontinue to work in the same vocation.    \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201315\nof the family (both male & female) often migrate to distant locations & engage in \nlow paying unorganized sectors. Without informed choice many of them also fall \nprey to trafficking as this is seen as the only way out of this situation. Hence the \ncreation of alternative livelihoods and the generation of supplementary income are \nkey areas to intervene for sustenance of the families of tea workers.  \n \nThe proposed action, both farm and farm allied income generating opportunities \nwill be carried out with 3500 households (3000 HHs in West Bengal, 500 HHs in \nAssam). Simultaneously, 1500 youth (1000 in West Bengal and 500 in Assam) will \nbe trained on vocational skills and provided with jobs and opportunity to be self-\nemployed.      \n \na.Farm and Farm allied income generation with 3500 Households:\n \nLivelihood planning for each household will be based on a participatory \nassessment and analysis of resources, skills, capacities of the Tea worker \nhouseholds. Our approach would entail optimum use of their homestead lands and \nincrease in their productive assets, mostly around livestock. We understand that \nworkers have no ownership rights on their dwellings or homestead lands, \ntherefore interventions will be planned and carried out with active engagement of \nrespective garden managements to mitigate the risks of unanticipated decisions of \ngarden managements. Tea worker households will be able to utilise their \nresources optimally through inputs and trainings on improved and scientific \npractices, diversification and improved skills.. All this will be facilitated by \ncreating local cadres of trained people who can continue to provide these services \nand knowledge to the local community. Key activities would include:\n \ni.Optimum utilisation of Homestead Lands: The project would facilitate \npromotion of multi-layered kitchen gardens meeting nutritional as well as \nincome needs of the tea worker families. Model of kitchen gardens will be \nestablished considering the seasonal variation and will include Vegetables \nsuch as brinjal, leafy vegetables, tomatoes etc.; Creepers such as bottle \ngourd, pumpkin; and Spices such as coriander & garlic. This will ensure \naccess to low-cost healthy diets throughout the year, save household \nexpenses & also provide opportunity for additional income.  A total of 600 \nkitchen gardens will be promoted (150-200 kitchen gardens each year) \nduring the project duration. (Ongoing-Year 1,2,3 & 4)\nii.Improvement in Productive assets - Livestock: The project will also \nprovide scientific technical trainings on backyard poultry, piggery (in \nBengal only) and goatery which will help reduce the high mortality rate of \nthe existing inventory of livestock & enable households to increase their \noverall HH income. This will be done through establishing both backward \nand forward linkages. Exposures and capacity building sessions by technical \nexperts in Bengal & Assam will be carried out to develop a community cadre \n(30), which will essentially take care the necessary need of vet care \nservices. Simultaneously, efforts will be made to collectivise and facilitate \nthe collective sale through the existing women\u2019s group. Further \nconvergence with line departments like animal resources departments, \nagriculture departments, horticulture departments, KVKs (Krishi Vigyan \nKendras) will be made for ensuring scale & sustainability beyond the \nproject. (Ongoing-Year 1,2,3 & 4)\nBlack pepper plantation around Areca Nut Tree: Many of the Tea workers \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201316\nhouseholds have Areca nut Tree in their homestead land. Black Pepper is the \nmost compatible perennial spice crop with areca nut and can be profitably \ngrown. The project will promote Black pepper and help tea worker households \nto learn the basics of its management. It takes three years for the black pepper \nto fruit, and in this period the project will also undertake market assessments \nto help the Women groups market these produce at fair prices, thereby \naugmenting their incomes.\n \nb.Vocational Skills with 1500 Youth:\n \nGiven that youth segment has an aspiration for other jobs beyond tea gardens, the \nproject will work with youth (both Male and female) to help them with relevant \nemployable and self-employable skills and assist them in getting jobs and/or start \ntheir own enterprise. Given the limited opportunities in the area, the project will \nmake an assessment of the skills and trades in which youth are engaged when they \nmigrate out of the state. Focussing on some of these trades will enable them to \nseek better wages at their destination locations. Youth who would want to set \nup/establish their own enterprise, targeted business and financial skills will also be \nimparted. Besides this, the project will also engage in building their self-esteem \nand leadership that are rooted in their cultural context and identity.        \n \nThe proposed action is based on the interest and aspirations of the youth. \nIdentification of vocational courses will be done based on assessment of their \ninterests and willingness to pursue the same as their career choice as well as \nmarket demand. Relevant training and courses will be offered in collaboration with \nGovernment recognised skill training institutions or other institutions having \nspecialised modules for selected trades. Post training, efforts will be made to link \ntrained youth to placement companies for jobs in the mainstream market or to \nfinancial institutions for setting up small business. Key activities include:\n \ni.Needs and Skills assessment for prioritising vocational courses and \nenterprises for skill trainings and enterprise promotion (Year 1): The \nproject will introduce a process of selection based on individual choices and \ninterests of youth. For example \u2013 in West Bengal counselling and career \nguidance will help youth to take informed choices around the various \nofferings. At the same time, in Assam, an open discussion with the youth of \nthe gardens and availability of local opportunities/offerings will help youth \nto share their willingness to join relevant courses. The project will also map \nsome of the skill gaps highlighted from major employers which would also \ninform their choices in pursuing their career aspirations.\nii.Enterprise development, Skill trainings on the identified vocational \ncourses through Resource Organisations or Government sponsored trainings \nsuch as Skill Mission, Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) \netc. (Y2: 500; Y3: 750; Y4: 250): Based on the skill gap and the choices \nshared by youth, the teams will organise the training offerings either \nthrough linking them with government run skill centres or resource \norganisations specialised in offering the courses. In Assam, an incubation \ncentre will be set up for youth who wants to pursue the courses to set up \ntheir own enterprise. Besides technical training, additional trainings on \nBusiness and financial skills will also be imparted to them.  Few of the \nvocational courses to be imparted to youth (as highlighted during our study) \nare \u2013 Police, Driving, Hospitality, Chef, Motor Mechanic, Beautician, Sewing \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201317\nOperator etc.       \niii.Counselling sessions, placement linkages and financial linkages \nthrough collaboration with placement agencies and financial \ninstitutions (Ongoing): The project will have a dedicated resource to work \nwith various placement and employer companies to be able to support the \ntrained youth in assuring their placements. Before the completion of the \nvocational courses, counselling sessions and softer skills to handle the \nchanges in a new work environment, adjustments to the new place, do\u2019s and \ndon\u2019ts of working will be undertaken. Youth who are keen to set up their \nown enterprises will be either linked to Banks for seed capital or linked to \ngovernment schemes such as MUDRA loan, Start Up India scheme, etc.\n7.3.a. Objective 3 (maximum one sentence):\nTo establish model for improving productivity and mitigating risks of climate \nchange through adoption of climate adaptive practices in two tea select gardens of \nWest Bengal  \n7.3.c. Objective 3\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\nAs per the research done by Tea Research Association, climate change is \nimpacting the tea producers in a significant way, as tea is mainly grown under \nrain-fed mono-cropping systems and weather conditions determine optimal growth \n& quality of tea. The current trend of irregular nature of rainfall in the area, forces \nthe growers to invest in irrigation facilities which also increases costs besides \nsevere shortage of drinking water to the tea workers, who live on the gardens. \nFurthermore, declining productivity, increased incidences of pests and diseases \ncompels the garden managements to use heavy doses of pesticides and chemicals \nhaving bearing on soil, the food safety standards & impacts severely on the health \nof the consumers and workers who are exposed to such chemicals. The study done \nby TRA assess that if this trend continues, large parts, where tea is grown \ncurrently will become unviable for commercial tea production in two to three \ndecades. \n \n7.3.b. Objective 3\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\na. Results of the Innovations and climate adaptive practices shared widely with \nthe other Tea Gardens/planters including government thereby improving \nvisibility and demand from the other tea gardens\nb.   Garden management and workers in 2 tea gardens show enhanced \nunderstanding and adaptation to climate change practices, perceives reduced risks \nand cost\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201318\nHence, the project intends to demonstrate and pilot innovative adaptive measures \nand create models of best practices to be further promoted & replicated to other \ntea gardens.  The project will work with two tea gardens in West Bengal. These \ntwo gardens will be selected based on the level of cooperation extended by garden \nmanagement and secondly on the extent of scarcity of drinking water in the \ngardens.\nThe proposed activities related are:\n \na.Water Recharging and harvesting measures: Since most of the tea \ngardens are located on undulating terrains, the runoff levels are high \nleading to drying up of natural springs which are the lifeline in the regions. \nOne hectare of mature tea plants require 10,000 litres of water per day \nwhich is equivalent to 2.5mm rainfall. Tea plants also need water after \npruning which is generally done during the months of Nov- Dec. This is the \nperiod when there is less rainfall resulting growers to invest in irrigation \nfacilities. Therefore, interventions on recharging ground water, protecting \ncatchments and reviving springs are critical and requires conjunctive \ninterventions by tea management as well as government. Following pilots \nwill be initiated:  \noWater recharge through rainwater harvesting will be initiated in the \ngardens in convergence with the Government and garden \nmanagement leveraging existing Government programmes. This \nwould start with the development of a well recharge plan based on \nthe principles of springshed management. A total of six such recharge \nstructure (three each in 2 Tea Gardens) will be undertaken (Y1 and Y \n3).    \noTwo pilots on providing drinking water will be carried out. This will \nbe a low cost and zero energy intensive model by diverting natural \nsprings and using gravity, channelling the water to the households. \nHouseholds will have potable water close to their homes which can be \nused for drinking and also for irrigation in their homesteads. This will \nbe done in Year 2 and Year 3   \nb.Climate adaptive practices: In this area, the activities will include \ntraining Tea garden management and workers on good climate resilient \npractices and in situ management. Demonstrations in propagation of \ndrought and stress tolerant cultivars, promotion of shade trees, \nintercropping, nutrient management through vermicompost, pest \nmanagement etc. will be done in collaboration with the Garden management \nin the two gardens. This will enable the garden management to experiment \nand introduce new practices in the garden. Trainings will be carried out in \ncollaboration with Tea Research Association (TRA) in Year 1 and Year 2. \nAdditionally, in association with TRA or private companies, environmental \nstewardship training shall be conducted in the two gardens to reduce \nenvironmental load of agro- chemicals and also workers safety at workplace. \nA total of 2 such trainings will be done in Year 2 and Year 3.\nc.Sustainability Standards: There is a growing trend in consumer \nawareness and brands across all segments are working towards engaging \nwith consumers to enhance transparency in sustainability practices adopted \nby them. Certification is usually done by third party agencies which is a \nmeans of providing assurance to the consumers on the sustainability \nstandards adopted by the organisations. In association with certification \nagencies such as Trustea, Rainforest Alliance and others, the project will \nfacilitate trainings for the two garden managements on standards for \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201319\ncertification and also expose the garden management to other gardens who \nhave implemented these standards. The project will encourage the garden \nmanagements in developing an implementation plan to meet the standards \nfor certification and also assist them in case of further need. This activity \nwill be initiated in Year 2 and carried on in Year 3. The project will facilitate \nthe tea gardens to adopt the best practices as per the sustainability \nstandards, however, the garden management will bear the cost of \ncertification.  \nDocumentation and development of IEC: The project will document and \nunderstand the results of the various innovations and best practices adopted by \nthe tea gardens. Appropriate IEC and communication materials will be developed \nand shared widely with various platforms and importantly across the gardens of \nintervention. Longitudinal study will be carried out on an annual basis to be able \nto understand the changes, inform and develop the IEC and communication \nmaterials\n7.4.a. Objective 4 (maximum one sentence):\nInformal Forum of Civil Society Organisations constructively engage for giving \ngreater voice and visibility to the conditions of tea worker community through \ncollective action and advocacy.\n7.4.c. Objective 4\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\nThe baseline research highlighted the multidimensional nature of vulnerability and \nissues of Tea worker communities across gender, age and social factors. Several \nCSOs, national and international organisations have worked towards addressing \nsome of these problems. With the changing context and policy regime affecting the \ntea industry, there is a constant need to learn and share knowledge, practices and \ncreate an enabling platform for cooperation and collaboration amongst various \norganisations working on Tea worker issues in particular and Tea sector in \ngeneral. The new labour code that is expected to replace the Plantation Labour Act \n1951 offers an important opportunity for broad based understanding and wide \ndissemination of the labour Code. There is scope for like-minded organisations to \ncome together as a support for Tea workers using their collective strength, \nexperience and influencing powers. This will provide greater visibility to the nearly \n7.4.b. Objective 4\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\na. CSO forum identifies at least two policy areas affecting tea workers and \nundertake joined up action as per the advocacy plan  \nb. Communication materials on new labour Code allows for easier and broad \nbased understanding of the provisions for all stakeholders including garden \nmanagement and tea workers\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201320\ninvisible workers of the most popular beverage of the country\n \nTraidcraft has past experience of successfully carrying out campaigns, research \nand advocating for policies regarding small tea growers and issues pertaining to \nAssam Tea workers. Building on this experience, Traidcraft India along with its \nexperts from the Policy team at Traidcraft UK would facilitate and steer the \ninformal forum of CSOs for peer to peer learning, sharing practices, capacity \nbuilding, issue based work and policy advocacy.\n \nThe following activities will be done under this objective:\n \na.Setting up the forum and joint agenda setting: The project will map \nrelevant CSOs, understand their expertise and assess their interest in \nworking with the Tea workers. In the Year 1 of the project, it would organise \nmeeting with the CSO\u2019s that show their interest and co-create its agenda \nand set policy goals. The informal CSO forum will work on creating \nawareness on identified topics through print media, social media and policy \nbriefs. One of the key agenda for the group would be to work on the Labour \nCode which replaces the Plantation Labour act. Specifically, the work would \nbe around simplified understanding of the key aspects of the new Labour \nCode, translations in local language and wider dissemination through \nworkshops and round tables. Other areas identified at this stage are to map \ngaps in specific State level rules post transposition of Central level Labour \nCode which affect Tea workers adversely. Mapping of these gaps would lead \nto identification of Policy asks and strategize accordingly.\nb.Issue Based Workshops and Round tables: Periodically, Traidcraft \nwould facilitate knowledge sharing through issue-based workshops and \nround tables for shared understanding on specific issues - for e.g. workers\u2019 \nrights, new labour code, women and violence, trafficking etc. Four round \ntables and issue-based learning sessions over Year 2 and Year 3 would be \norganised. This would also help strengthen capacities of the CSO partners of \nthe forum besides developing collective strategy and joined up action to \naddress the various issues of the Tea workers, both in West Bengal and \nAssam. This would be complemented by Policy Advocacy team at UK taking \nup an assessment of business performance of Tea companies to assess the \noverall viability of the companies and scope to invest for welfare of workers. \nInsights from this study will feed into advocacy strategy at UK and India \nlevel in the next phase.\nCommunication and Dissemination event: Working paper, discussions from \nthe round table, communication materials on the new labour code, learnings from \nthe project, results from the longitudinal study etc. will form some of the key \ndocuments and knowledge product of the project. Communication material in form \nof audio visual would also be developed for creating visibility on the of issues of \ntea worker communities. The same will be disseminated as part of the National \nlevel dissemination event and other forums, that will be organised in the Year 4.  \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201321", "8. COOPERATION": "8. Cooperation\nDescribe the level of cooperation with other organisations and networks \nand explain how this cooperation helps achieve your goals (maximum 300 \nwords):\nTraidcraft Exchange will work closely with local partners Prasari in West Bengal \nand Pajhra in Assam in a spirit of co-implementors with Partners driving the work \non the ground, and Traidcraft providing the technical support, and amplifying tea \nworkers voices by convening forums and use of social media. Both CSOs have been \nworking in the region and have good relationships with the tea communities. \nTraidcraft will work with its India counterpart - Traidcraft Services Private Limited \n(TSIPL) \u2013 a wholly owned subsidiary of Traidcraft Exchange. TSIPL is a social \nenterprise working towards trade justice and climate justice. TSIPL supports fair \ntrade and responsible business practices that benefit workers and producers and \noffer strategic advisory and consulting services that are backed with the capacity \nto support on-ground implementation across India\u2019s diverse geographies. Besides \nmanaging the overall program, Traidcraft (TSIPL) will specifically lead the work on \nClimate adaptive practices (objective 3) in collaboration with Tea Research \nAssociation, Tea Garden management and on ground support from Prasari. \nSimultaneously, Traidcraft including the Traidcraft Exchange policy unit in UK will \nlead in setting up and coordination of the informal CSO group (Objective 4). \nParallelly, the Traidcraft team will also support both Prasari and Pajhra in market \nlinkages and help trained youth find jobs in Companies, build linkages with \nplacement agencies and help set up robust collective enterprises (Objective 2). \nImportantly, the project\u2019s learning will be facilitated through annual planning and \nreflection workshops, enabling both Prasari and Pajhra synergies their on-ground \nactions for future.                            \n \nPRASARI, established in 2007, works specifically in the areas of water security, \ndiversion-based irrigation to augment the water, and income and nutritional \nsecurity of the rural households. It works through establishing multi-tiered \nwomen-led institutions which are the building blocks to execute any programme. \nThey are active in the Dooars region (Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling, Kalimpong, \nAlipurduar) of West Bengal and have successfully piloted diversion-based \nirrigation projects in collaboration with the government and other philanthropic \ndonors. Prasari will implement the project across 25 tea gardens across Jalpaiguri, \nKalimpong and Darjeeling. Specific role of Prasari in this project includes: a) \nestablishing robust women and youth forum in all the 25 Tea Gardens in West \nBengal; b) work closely with government and Tea garden management in linking \nup with various social entitlement schemes including nutrition, drinking water, \nenterprise development etc.; c) establishing farm based livelihoods to 3000 \nhouseholds and counselling and ensuring skill training of 1000 youth; and d) \nundertake innovative pilots around spring shed, well recharge and diversion based \ndrinking water. While they have been working specifically with women primarily \nlooking at water, livelihoods and nutritional security, working with youth and using \na rights perspective from the workers point of view would be a newer area for \nthem. The project will support building their capacities by bringing experts \nworking on youth mobilisation and development. Exposure to Assam and Pajhra \nwill inform their orientation on youth mobilisation as well as build their worker\u2019s \nrights perspective. Traidcraft will also help them in bringing in a market \nperspective for some of the on-farm and off-farm livelihoods besides building \nlinkages and networks for the placement of skilled youth in urban areas.              \n    \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201322\nPAJHRA was established in November 2001 by a group of Adivasi social activists \nand leaders. It works towards building capabilities of the Adivasi community to \naccess their entitlements, improve their socio-economic status in the society and \ntheir wellbeing, and promoting social integration of Adivasis from all walks of life \nin Assam. Pajhra will implement the project across 10 tea gardens across \nBiswanath and Sonitpur districts in Assam. In this project, Pajhra will specifically \nlead on: a) establishing robust women and youth forum in all the 10 Tea Gardens \nin Assam; b) working closely with government and Tea garden management in \nlinking up with various social entitlement schemes including nutrition, drinking \nwater, youth scholarship, enterprise development etc.; c) establishing farm based \nlivelihoods to 500 households and counselling and ensuring skill training of 500 \nyouth. In addition to this, Pajhra will also bring its knowledge on the issue of Tea \nworkers and build perspective around wage and living wage within the CSO \ngroup.  Pajhra has been working with tea workers, which are primarily Adivasis, \nand have been actively developing youth and women leaders within the \ncommunity. Skill building, enterprise development for youth and climate adaptive \npractices will be a newer area of work for them. Traidcraft will mentor Pajhra\u2019s \nimplementation team in ensuring business and market linkage support. At the \nsame time, engagement with TRA and exposure to Prasari\u2019s project area will build \ntheir perspective on climate adaptive practices. \n \nAnother area of cooperation and support sought by both organisations is in the \narea of Organisational Development. Pajhra has expressed their need for \nreviewing their organisational work and identify areas that require improvement \nor strengthening. Based on the review, Pajhra would also be open to consider a \npossible restructuring. This has been also mandated by their Board and would \nhave full support from their leadership team. Prasari, who has recently undergone \nan Organisational Review Exercise and is already implementing the \nrecommendations, is keen to develop inhouse capacities within management team \nto take up Organisational Development (OD) and Learning in future. They would \nlike to invest in capacity building of management team members on OD processes.\n \nApart from these two field partner CSOs, the program will also engage other \nstakeholders and agencies, primarily towards achieving its objective for piloting \nclimate adaptive practices & sustainability standards in the tea gardens and \nestablishing an informal CSO group working for the welfare of tea workers both at \nregional and national level. Traidcraft will spearhead both the partnership and \nleading the thematic area, given its own capability and knowledge in the tea sector \nand understanding of the system of managing and implementing standards.\nFor climate adaptive practices, we would partner with the Tea Research \nAssociation (TRA) \u2013 which has been set up principally to improve the overall \nproductivity and quality of the tea. It is a pioneer and innovator in tea research \nand provides extension services to the tea industry. We are already in discussion \nwith TRA HQ in Kolkata and they have their field offices both at Jorhat (Assam) \nand Jalpaiguri (West Bengal). In relation to improving and promoting sustainability \nstandards (both climate as well as worker friendly) in the tea gardens where we \nwould work, we will engage with multi stakeholder initiatives such as Trustea (an \nIndian sustainability code and verification system for the tea sector working with \nsmallholder tea growers, bought leaf factories, estates and packers to address \nsome of the key challenges in the industry including working conditions, health \nand safety of tea workers, water pollution, food safety, soil erosion and \ncontamination) and/or Trinitea (an Indian initiative to transform the tea \nsmallholder segment in India while taking care of the social and environmental \nissues).\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201323\n    \nFor initiating the informal CSO group, we will partner with a number of like-\nminded CSO\u2019s and MSI\u2019s that are active in working for the welfare of tea workers \nand the tea sector overall. Organisations like Oxfam, Nazdeek, UNWomen, Unicef, \nSolidaridad and many more will be contacted to be a part of this initiative. We \nhave discussed the idea with Oxfam, and they have shown a very positive response \non the same.      \n \nIn addition to this, expert organisations working on the issues of youth, skill \nbuilding, leadership and domestic violence will be roped in as resource agencies to \nbe able to support the partners\u2019 capacity development.", "9.

(maximum \n300 words):\nIn this phase, the project will be able to build the foundation of stronger and \nempowered tea community across 35 tea Gardens. Besides this, an enabling \nenvironment and engagement model between tea garden management, tea \ncommunities, government and CSO\u2019s will be strengthened. Successful models of \nclimate adaptive practices will be tested and will be ready to be scaled to other tea \ngardens. At the end of the project, following expected impacts are envisaged:\nThe following changes are envisaged at the end of four year:\n \n\u2022Strengthened community groups and forums working with the Garden \nManagement, Panchayats and Government officials to improve the delivery \nof various services and entitlements. \n\u2022Improved choices and alternative options of Tea worker communities \nthrough diversified livelihoods, skills and knowledge.

Evaluation\nHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):\nOur commitment to understanding the impact of our programmes and driving \ncontinued learning and improving, requires that we utilize robust M&E methods, \nsystems and tools. Following mechanisms will be put in place to assess the \nprogress, monitor and evaluate the success of the project;\n \na. Participatory approach to MEL: Traidcraft Exchange will adopt a \nparticipatory approach for monitoring the progress of the project. This will \nbe determined by the local communities\u2019 identification of the metrics of \ntheir progress based on the ground situation and the baseline. Supporting \nproject participants to themselves determine their metrics will enable a \nprocess of empowerment of local workers in the tea estate which will \nstrengthen their sense of agency and also increase their mutual \ncollaboration for collective benefit. Traidcraft has experience to support \nlocal collectives on participatory monitoring of their own development and \nwill guide the process in the duration of the project. In addition to this, \nengaging selected beneficiaries for longitudinal case studies which is a more \nqualitative approach to capture changes in their lives over a period of time, \nwill be undertaken by the project. Such studies supported by case studies \nwill capture degree of change in confidence and leadership abilities of the \ntarget group. This will include improvement in livelihoods, agency and \naspirations, access to entitlements etc.\n \nb. Logical Framework Analysis (LFA) based progress assessment: \nComplementing the above participatory approach to MEL, the project will \nhave a clear set of indicators for each outcome and output area outlined \nabove based on the LFA framework. Development of the LFA and monitoring \nframework at the outset of the initiation of the project will be carried out in \ncollaboration with the on-ground partners \u2013 viz. Prasari and Pajhra. This will \nbe guided by a detailed baseline that will be done in the first year of the \nproject.  Data will be collected against the set indicators for the above-\nmentioned Outcome areas. Specifically, data on current levels of production \nin the two pilot gardens, availability and accessibility of drinking water, \nsources of water and cultivation practices will be collected in baseline and \nmapped annually to understand the changes on these parameters as well as \nadoption of recommended practices on environment and safety measures.  A \ndynamic excel based project MIS will be developed to capture the data and \ntrack the progress.  \n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201325\nc. Ongoing Monitoring and Learning: Traidcraft India will manage all M&E \nactivities with support from our UK-based Quality & Impact Lead. Monthly \nreview meetings with partners will be done as part of planning and \nmonitoring. External members of Traidcraft will join quarterly meetings \nwhich will be documented through quarterly reports and meeting minutes. \nThese meetings will provide opportunities for the project team to reflect on \nprogress, learning and implications for adaptive programming. In addition, \nthe project will also organise annual partners meet for reflections and \nplanning for the upcoming year. These annual reflection exercises are \nfacilitated to capture individual and collective learnings on the project, that \nare essential for future planning. In addition, it helps in identifying \nshortcomings and build common strategy to address as a group. Annual \nNarrative and Financial Reports will be prepared that will be shared with \nOak Foundation on a periodic basis.\n \nd. Mid term and Endline Evaluation: A mid-term evaluation will be done by the \nsecond year end for reviewing progress and learning based on which \nrecommendations will be incorporated. Mid term assessment typically \ninvolves assessment of the progress, more importantly capturing the key \nlearnings and assessment of any mid-term course correction requirement in \nthe project. It is carried out by Traidcraft team members who are not \ndirectly associated with the project management or implementation. A final \nevaluation will be conducted by the project end using mixed methodology \n(both qualitative and quantitative tools with participatory approaches) to \nassess the project\u2019s impact and learning including progress against all \nindicators, outcomes and objectives. It is especially important as proposed \nwork is a multi-phase programme, where the learnings from the endline \nevaluation will contribute to the design of the next phase.", "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11. Future Plans\nHow will the grant influence the organisation and future plans? (maximum \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201326\n300 words):\nTraidcraft is keen to work to resolve issues of tea workers and so this is a long \nterm partnership. Along with our local partners we will support interventions to \nimprove the livelihoods of the tea worker communities and help in developing \nsustainable models for income diversification while imparting new skills and \nknowledge. Based on this, there is significant scope of expanding these initiatives \nin similar geographies with similar issues. The grant will also demonstrate \nmultipronged intervention models based on an assessment of skills, resources, \ncapabilities and aspirations of the community of tea workers.\n \nWhile Traidcraft has already gained an understanding of multidimensional \nvulnerability in the lives of tea worker communities, the interventions require a \nlong-term engagement with the community. Having suffered from such issues \nacross generations, there is a sense of hopelessness and erosion of agency. \nTherefore, it is imperative that interventions build incremental improvement and \nthereby confidence to exert their agency. Thus the intervention design will span \nmulti-phase interventions, of which the current phase is primarily the entry point, \naimed at establishing rapport and confidence as well as an enabling environment \nto piggy back other interventions addressing issues of rights, working conditions, \nmigration, trafficking, violence and climate change. In this, there is opportunity to \nscale operations in other geographies in the north east as well as other tea \ngrowing regions.\n \nTraidcraft UK, through its previous interventions with global brands, has \nsignificant experience of creating transparency in sourcing tea and also raising \nconsumer awareness regarding issues on the ground. A long-term model for \ndomestic area can be designed to raise consumer awareness regarding the issues \nfaced by workers and engaging local brands and other stakeholders in promoting \nmore transparent ways of operating. This will create a new wave in consumer \nawareness and brand engagement in the country which has one of the highest tea \nconsuming population.\n \nTraidcraft also will take a lead role to create a multi-stakeholder platform for the \nissues in the tea sector. This platform will have civil society organisations, donor \nagencies, local activists and government representatives who will work towards \nimproving policy and action taking into account the voices of the affected people. \nWe envisage that such a platform will provide Traidcraft the opportunity to \nhighlight the issues of the tea worker community and create an enabling \nenvironment overall.\n \nGiven that climate change has a significant impact on productivity in the tea sector \nTraidcraft, through this project will rope in other stakeholders like the Tea \nResearch Association etc. to provide the needed inputs and knowledge on better \nmanagement practices suitable to changing climatic conditions which will provide \nuseful directions to other tea estate managements in the regions.\n \nTraidcraft will actively disseminate these learnings amongst a wide audience so \nthat there is greater awareness on the issues of tea.  This will enable a more \nequitable playing field for various actors engaged in the tea industry, especially \nthe tea estate workers who constitute the weakest link in the chain.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201327", "12.

(600 \nwords): \nContext \nInformal workers form the mainstay of the Indian economy. Informal workers in Kolkata\u2019s slum \nsettlements face numerous challenges. Economically, they endure unstable incomes, lack social \nsecurity, and are often exploited. Housing is overcrowded and poorly constructed. Health issues \nare rampant due to unsanitary conditions, limited healthcare access, and poor nutrition. \nEducational opportunities are scarce, with many children forced into labor. Environmental \nhazards, such as pollution and vulnerability to natural disasters, exacerbate their living \nconditions. Basic infrastructure, including clean water, electricity, and proper sewage systems, is \noften inadequate.  \nThe Kolkata Metropolitan Area is a metropolitan area in the Indian state of West Bengal, centred \naround the city of Kolkata (also known as Calcutta). It is the largest urban agglomeration in the \neastern part of India and the third largest in the country, housing over 14.85 million people, as of \nthe 2011 census. The Kolkata Metropolitan Area is comprised of the city of Kolkata, its suburbs, \nseveral neighbouring towns (including 4 municipal corporations, and 27 municipalities) and \nadjoining rural areas. It is the economic, cultural, and educational hub of eastern India and hosts \nseveral major commercial and industrial centres, making it one of the most important economic \nzones in India.[3] \nInformal workers like street vendors, domestic workers, construction workers and waste pickers \nare expected to be around 20 - 25 lakh (over 2 million) in a similar situation as other parts of the \ncountry, without much social security and living in the margins of the current developmental \ndiscourse. The KMA also has a large informal sector that employs a significant number of migrant \nworkers, particularly in construction, domestic work, and small-scale industries. These workers \nface compounded challenges such as low wages, long working hours, and poor working \nconditions. Many of them live in makeshift housing and lack access to basic amenities like clean \nwater, sanitation, and health care. Migrant workers face social challenges, such as \ndiscrimination, isolation, and limited access to education and health services. It is estimated that \naround 50% of the informal workers (1 million) are migrants, with an equal percentage from \nother districts of Bengal and migrants from other states like Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, and \nAssam. An equal or similar share of outmigration is reported as well.[4] \nThe Kolkata Metropolitan Area is also located precariously. Like many other coastal cities in the \nworld, is facing a range of impacts from climate change and is listed in the top eight megacities \nto be first impacted by climate change. The city is in the deltaic region of eastern India, which \nmakes it vulnerable to sea level rise and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather \nevents such as tropical cyclones, heavy rainfall, and heat waves.[5] The changing climate is \nleading to an increased risk of coastal flooding and erosion, as well as water scarcity, particularly \nduring the dry season. The city's infrastructure and public services, including transportation, \nenergy, and water systems, are also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which can \nstrain these systems and result in economic losses. In addition to the physical impacts, the \nchanging climate also has social and economic impacts on the people of the Kolkata \nMetropolitan Area. The most impacted areas overlapping directly with the informal worker \nsettlements in the region are vulnerable to displacement, loss of livelihoods, and increased \npoverty because of climate change. \n \n \nOak Application Form     7 \nTo address these challenges, the government in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area, led by the \nKolkata Municipal Corporation are taking steps to increase the region's resilience to climate \nchange. This includes implementing flood control measures, improving disaster preparedness \nand response, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, and preparing climate action plans for \ntheir cities.[6][7] The major concern in the slew of positively directed actions is that informal \nworkers, their live-work settlements and their livelihoods as of now are not a major focus area \nof the climate resilience actions pushed by the state and authorities. Thereby ignoring the most \nvulnerable, impacted informal workers from the climate resilience action plans for the region. \nAlso straight-jacketed approaches of focusing on the urban \u2018infrastructure\u2019 building, without \nfocusing on capacities and linkages ignoring migration from climate-impacted rural regions is \nanother gap amongst many in the climate resilience actions. This approach requires a \u2018change\u2019: \nin perspective and in action.  That is what this intervention sets to achieve \u2013 CHANGE that is for \nand led by the empowerment of the most vulnerable informal worker communities. \n[1] In India, informal workers are those individuals who work in unorganized sectors and are not \ncovered by labour laws or social security measures. This segment of the workforce includes self-\nemployed individuals, casual labourers, street vendors, domestic workers, and other \nunorganized sector workers. \n[2] The labour codes in India refer to a set of laws and regulations that govern various aspects of \nemployment, including wages, working conditions, social security, and industrial relations. In \n2020, the Indian government introduced four new labour codes, namely, the Code on Wages, \nthe Industrial Relations Code, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, and \nthe Social Security Code. \n[3] https://kmda.wb.gov.in/ \n[4] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/more-migrants-to-city-from-other-states-\nthan-districts/articleshow/70354414.cms \n[5] https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/disaster-deaths-sinking-unprepared-\nkolkata-face-multiple-climate-risks-warns-ipcc-report-82004 \n[6] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-set-to-get-own-climate-action-plan-\n2nd-city-after-mum/articleshow/92049423.cms \n[7] https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/cop27-kolkata-presents-climate-action-\nroadmap-announces-city-level-summit-86026 \nMHT with support from the Oak Foundation will implement the project titled \u201cCommunity Led \nclimate resilience for informal workers\u201d with an objective to build resilience of urban poor \nfamilies.

Community Mobilization: In the challenging and often marginalized \nenvironments of urban settlement in both ULB, community mobilization plays \na pivotal role in initiating and sustaining positive change. MHT will deploy \ndiverse methods such as folk media, community meetings and video \nscreenings to engage residents based on their local context and acceptance. \nThe overarching goal is to raise awareness about the organization and project \ndetails while establishing a strong rapport with the community. This approach \nensures active community participation and a sense of ownership over the \nprojects.  \n \nii. Research study  \nBaseline study on social security: In the inception stage of the project (1st quarter) \nhousehold level social security survey will be carried out in 30 project slums. Survey \nwill be conducted with below given objectives: \nAssess Accessibility and Awareness: \n\u2022 Objective: To evaluate the current level of accessibility to and awareness of \nexisting social security schemes among households in the project slums. \n \n \nOak Application Form     10 \n\u2022 Rationale: Understanding the baseline accessibility and awareness will help \nidentify gaps and barriers preventing households from fully benefiting from \nthese schemes. \nIdentify Needs and Preferences: \n\u2022 Objective: To identify the specific social security needs of households and \ntheir preferred methods for receiving services. \n\u2022 Rationale: Gathering information on households' needs and preferences will \nenable the project to tailor interventions and recommendations to better \nmeet the community's requirements. \nEvaluate Willingness to Pay: \n\u2022 Objective: To determine the willingness of households to pay for social \nsecurity services and their expectations regarding service delivery. \n\u2022 Rationale: Understanding the financial willingness and expectations of \nhouseholds will inform the design and implementation of sustainable social \nprotection schemes that are both affordable and acceptable to the \ncommunity. \niii. Landscape study- integration of climate resilience in existing policy: To \nenhance climate resilience for the urban poor and informal sector workers, we \npropose conducting a comprehensive landscape study of existing state and \nlocal government policies and programs. This intervention will involve a \ndetailed analysis of current policy frameworks to assess the extent to which \nclimate change considerations are integrated. By identifying gaps and \nopportunities, we aim to pinpoint strategic entry points for strengthening \nclimate resilience measures within social security programs. This approach will \nenable us to develop targeted recommendations for policy enhancements \nthat not only address immediate social security needs but also build long-term \nresilience against climate-related vulnerabilities, ensuring sustainable and \ninclusive growth for the most marginalized populations. \niv.  Formation and Trainings of CAGs : It is increasingly accepted that the social \ncapital of communities can contribute to beneficial economic and social \noutcomes in urban development. MHT believes that if the grassroots \ncollectives of women are provided with the requisite knowledge, technology \nand skills to identify and assess development issues, they will be able to \nconstructively engage with governance and planning processes to lead \ntransformation in their own communities. Based on this philosophy, MHT will \norganise and train women leaders from urban poor communities across city. \nThese women leaders will undergo extensive training on various subject like \ncollective leadership, government structure, map sharing & participation, \nformation of slum development plan, climate change etc. These women \nleaders will then lead project activities in urban poor settlements across both \nULB. They will play pivotal role in connecting urban poor communities with \ncity government, elected representative and other stakeholders.

Conduct Climate Vulnerability Assessment  \nCommunity-based Vulnerability Assessment is being done with special toolkit which \nis a set of seven participatory tools, which aimed to create an understanding among \nthe community about climate change and its varied impacts. The purpose of this \nexercise is to create a understanding in terms of climate change. The first stage of the \nexercise is the realise stage, where the purpose is to inculcate a understanding where \nthe community starts to envision the harmful weather effects that they are facing \nwith climate change. The second stage is the Analyse stage, where community starts \nto interlink the effects and initiate a thought process from systems thinking approach. \nThe third stage contains visualization of effects with respect to their areas. In the last \nstage, based upon the previous processes where risks were identified, community will \nsynthesis a resilience plan. \n \nvii.

The initiative grew into a full -blown project and finally culminated in the \nestablishment of Kolkata Sanved in 2004 to serve as a platf orm for using DMT in \npsychosocial rehabilitation.  Sohini was awarded the Ashoka Fellowship for her \n \n \nOak Application Form8 \ninnovative and unique idea that incorporated creative therapies within traditional \nrehabilitation programmes, and more importantly: in building capacity with in the \nparticipants to become DMT practitioners themselves, able to earn a living as well as live \na life of dignity and respect.   \n \nKS\u2019s culturally contextual model Sampoornata (meaning \u201cfulfilment\u201d) focuses on holistic \nwell-being and bringing about a \u201ccha nge within\u201d.

(600 words): \n \nIndia is home to the world's largest youth population, totalling over 808 million individuals, \nconstituting around 66% of the overall populace. The mental health and well -being of \nadolescents and young adults are pivotal for comprehensive development. Give n that a \nsignificant portion of mental health conditions emerges by the mid -twenties, a systematic \napproach to addressing youth mental health is imperative. India, with a youth demographic \nof over 250 million aged 15 \u201324, grapples with unique challenges suc h as academic \npressure, interpersonal relationships, vocational concerns, and discrimination based on \ncaste, social status, and gender norms. The National Mental Health Survey for India \ndiscloses alarmingly high suicide rates, standing at 17.1 per 100,000 among young adults \nand 9.52 per 100,000 among adolescents. The COVID -19 pandemic exacerbated existing \nchallenges, leading to increased stress, depression, anxiety, post -traumatic stress, \nsubstance abuse, and suicides among young people. The pandemic widene d existing \ninequities, disproportionately affecting those in poor communities, who face additional \nbarriers in accessing resources for health, education and social welfare.  \nDespite being viewed as the energetic force shaping society's future, the youth ar e \nsusceptible to various challenges and vulnerabilities. These encompass engaging in high -\nrisk behaviours exposing them to criminal activities, accidents, physical injuries, emotional \ndistress, and various health issues. Limited employment options, restric ted access to \ninformation, and economic displacement have a lasting psycho-social impact on children, \nyouth, and their families, particularly concerning mental health. This impact manifests in \nfeelings of isolation, identity struggles, and a prevailing sense of hopelessness. \nThe youth in North Bengal's tea gardens face multifaceted challenges that hinder their \ngrowth, development, and wellbeing. These challenges stem from the historical context of \nthe tea industry's crisis, economic disparities, and lack of  access to education and \nopportunities. Although tea estate employees constitute a substantial workforce, their \nsocio-economic conditions remain deplorable. \nWithin this context, the youth in tea gardens confront an array of challenges, including \nseverely limited access to quality education, healthcare, and employment opportunities, \nfostering a pervasive sense of hopelessness and disempowerment. Many youths and \nteenagers in these areas struggle for survival, with educational opportunities remaining \ndistant dreams for most. Children and youth often fall victim to trafficking for labour and \nother forms of exploitation, exacerbating their challenges. \nSustained psycho -social support interventions are essential to empower the youth, \nenhance their mental and emotio nal resilience, and provide them with opportunities for a \nbrighter future.  \nOur approach involves engaging youth groups and key stakeholders through Dance \nMovement Therapy (DMT) sessions, ensuring a participatory process that incorporates \ntheir voices and perspectives into the design of future interventions. \nIn accordance with the Kolkata Sanved model, the process for establishing the demand for \nmental well-being interventions follows a strategic sequence. Initially, our model operates \nin collaboration with  existing organizations in the region and the target community, \nleveraging established networks and resources. Secondly, a community network is \ncultivated, providing orientation to individuals on the benefits of mental well-being to raise \nawareness and pro mote understanding within the community. The intervention itself \n \n \nOak Application Form10 \nincorporates a unique feature, offering participants the opportunity to undergo training as \nDance Movement Therapy (DMT) practitioners and change-makers. This approach not only \nenhances the s kills and knowledge of community members but also empowers them to \nactively contribute to mental well -being initiatives. A pivotal role is played by the youth \nleader who, having undergone training becomes an ambassador through this process, and \nconducts well-being sessions within the community. This individual effectively bridges the \ngap, meeting the demand for mental well-being interventions at the grassroots level. \n \n \n6.

Activities and timeframe: \nList in bullet points the main types of activities that you plan to carry out to achieve your \nexpected outcomes. Please keep these at a high level and don\u2019t include the full list of every \nactivity you plan to carry out, Instead, concentrate on the type of activities this grant will fund. \nIf your Programme Officer wants more information, we will ask you separately for a work plan. \nExamples might include: \no Research  \no Provision of legal advice to... \no Trainings on movement building for... \n \nPhase 1: Formative Research and piloting DMT session: 18 months  \n \nIn the first half of the project, our primary focus will be on conducting a thorough Needs \nAssessment and Situational Analysis. This step is pivotal for understanding the unique \nchallenges and aspirations of the local youth, communities, and stakeholders within North \nBengal in relation to mental health and well -being. This phase will involve multiple crucial \nactivities including a pilot of DMT sessions within the new region. To start off with, Kolkata \nSanved will conduct an orientation on the program with all the concerned stakeholders. \n \nThe broad activities will include: \n \n\u25cf Preparation: Project team formation, partner identification, stakeholder mapping, \nlocation identification \n\u25cf Situational analysis and assessment: Research design and methodology, data \ncollection, DMT sessions with the youth, data analysis \n\u25cf Community engagement  through DMT, DMT based workshops with youth and \nstakeholders \n\u25cf Developing Final Module and Intervention Plan: Dissemination with local \nstakeholders \n\u25cf Monitoring & Documentation \nIn this participatory research methodology, the tools that will be used for data c ollection \nare a combination of the following, which includes survey, Focused Group Discussions \n(FGD), one to one interview, self -reporting through questionnaires and Dance Movement \ntherapy-based workshops. Kolkata Sanved plans to engage Praxis for implemen ting this \nresearch.  \nThis situation analysis will be a community led research where the youth and community \nmembers will be involved in the research process. For example, having a discussion with \nthem to develop research questions in order to design the intervention around their needs.  \nThe formative research will largely focus on the current reality of North Bengal Youth \nwhether the planned intervention will fulfil the needs and complement those reality. The \nresearch will include sample locations with a mi x of socio -cultural identities, including \ngender and a few other categories such as education, opportunity, aspirations. Ideally, we \nare planning for 3 locations in each district to get a comprehensive scenario. As this \n \n \nOak Application Form12 \nintervention will be focused on ment al health, wellbeing and agency building, we will also \ninclude a mental health expert in the team.  \nPhase 2: Implementation: 18 months \nIn the second half of the project, our focus will be to implement the intervention plan in at \nleast one block in Jalpaiguri and Kalimpong division, targeting approximately 100 youth \nthrough DMT-based regular training and workshops. Our goal is to create at least 20 \nyouth leaders, engage 10 key influencers, and involve 200 community members. \n\u25cf Training Of Trainer with youth. \n\u25cf DMT based Healing Wellbeing sessions \n\u25cf DMT based capacity building sessions \n\u25cf Baseline and Endline data collection \n\u25cf Community Engagement \n\u25cf Collaborative Network Formation  \n\u25cf Monitoring & Documentation \n \n7. CAPACITY BUILDING \n \nWill this grant contain funds specifically ear-marked for Capacity Building / Organizational \nDevelopment (CB/OD) of your organization, or does the grant have a specific CB/OD \ncomponent? \n \nYES  \n \nKolkata Sanved is in the process of creating its Centre for Cre ative Wellbeing and Social \nChange, where we have received our first funding support to lay down the infrastructure. \nThis centre will gradually transform into an institute. With the establishment of the institute, \nKolkata Sanved has a tremendous opportunity  to leverage its partnerships and revenue -\ngenerating activities. Our goal is to create Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) entrepreneurs \nfrom this institute. The institute will serve as a hub for training programs, workshops, and \nacademic courses, attracting both students and professionals from various regions.  \n \nKolkata Sanved is unique in its commitment towards staff well -being and skill building, \nleading to organizational enhancement. We firmly believe that capacity building of staff \ncontributes to the strength  of the organization which aids in its growth and impact in the \nsector. We believe in and practice honoring lived experience. The power of lived \nexperiences is encapsulated in our model and reflected in our programme and journey. \n60% of our employees have emerged from grass root backgrounds, a testament to our \ninclusive ethos. Their presence extends not only within the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) \nbut also our governing body.  \n \nPresently, we are actively engaged in strengthening our second -line leaders (SLT), aiming \nto develop a Collective Leadership Model within the organization. To develop this model, \nKolkata Sanved intends to invest on a process -based approach on its SLT over a span of \n3 years. This model ensures that leadership is distributed across the organization, tapping \n \n \nOak Application Form13 \ninto diverse perspectives and expertise. Additionally, this model empowers employees at \nall levels, creating a sense of ownership and commitment to the organization's mission.  \n \nThe trainings under this model will include personal growth sessions, group development \nworkshops, strategic planning workshops, and mentorship sessions. By prioritizing these \naspects, KS fosters a culture of reflective leadership, where leaders are encouraged to \ncontinuously learn and grow. This not only benefits the individual employees but also \ncreates a work environment where everyone feels supported, valued, and empowered to \ncontribute effectively. \n \nThe activities will include: \n \n1. Personal Growth sessions: Personal growth sessions give employees opportunity \nto nurture self -awareness, resilience, and emotional intelligence which are \nessential qualities for effective leadership. Improved mental health leads to higher \nproductivity and better decision-making skill. This activity will comprise of a total \nof 20 group personal growth sessions for 5 groups @ 4 sessions per group per \nyear for 3 years. \n \n2. Group Development workshops: These workshops will emphasize on team \nbuilding and strengthening efforts with specific focus on nurturing communication \nskills, feedback skills, appreciative inquiry and creating a sense of ownership. It \nalso helps in creating a supportive work place environment. This will comprise of \n4 days of workshops per year, for 3 years with the entire KS team. \n \n3. Strategic Planning workshops: These workshops will help to create the framework \nand develop key principles of Collective Leadership Model. It will comprise of 4 \ndays of workshop with the SLT in year 1 and 2 days of review workshop in year 2. \n \n4. Mentorship sessions: These sessions are required for mentoring SLT members on \na regular basis on issue -based understanding of the working field as some \nmembers come from non-academic background and did not get the opportunity \nfor a ttending formal education. They have mostly acquired knowledge on the \nsector through lived experiences. This will include 2 days of session and 1 day \nassessment (total 3 days), every 6 months for 3 years. \n \nData Management and New Technologies: This part we want technical support from OAK \n \nThe adoption of emerging technologies enables capacity building by fostering \ninnovation and providing tools for skill development.
