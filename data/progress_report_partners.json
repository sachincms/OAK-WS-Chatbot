AID promotes sustainable, equitable, and just development. It \nsupports grassroots organisations in India working on education, livelihoods, \nnatural resources, agriculture, health, gender, and social justice. \n \n \n \n7.", "Progress Against Objectives": "Progress Against Objectives \nUnder each expected project objective, briefly explain your progress in reaching the objective and its \nresults, and discuss any changes you propose to the project goals or objectives with the PO. \n \n7.1.a. Objective 1 \nUse the Forest Rights Act to claim legal rights for individuals and communities and strengthen grassroots \ndemocratic institutions in 200 villages across 4 districts of northern West Bengal. \n \n \n7.1.b. Objective 1: Principal accomplishments \nVery good ground mobilis ation despite the pandemic. The following meetings at various levels were \norganised. \n20 community level meetings were organised with 40 participants on an average. Any adult in the village \ncan attend this type of open meeting. In some places women participation is less as they go to work in others \nhomes for domestic help or they go to forest for foraging. Increasing livelihood options in the village will \nhelp women\u2019s increase participation. The purpose of these meetings was to provide basic orientation on the \nFRA and talk about the provisions under FRA to start new Gram Sabhas. \n1 district level meeting was organised where Gram Sabha members from 30 villages spread across 3 districts \nhad participated. Basically, the district meeting was organised to raise awa reness around FRA so that \nrepresentatives would go back to their respective villages and work with other villagers in order to \nstrengthen their Gram Sabhas. Sometimes people don't realise that they got less land while getting the Patta. \nThose who have rece ived less land under IFR are going back to the district officials. Those villages that \nhave not been converted to revenue villages have started the process as a result of this meeting. \n3 alliance building meetings with like -minded organisations were organi sed in Nagpur, Kolkata and in \nPurulia. Different groups related to forest issues from different districts have participated in the meetings \nso that the FRA is implemented better across the state. \nVillage level leadership committees were formed in 7 villages to drive the community processes through \nGram Sabhas. \nCapacity building workshop on GPS & satellite mapping is going on for CFR mapping in the operational \nforest villages with the Gram Sabha representatives so that they can authenticate their cust omary forest \nboundary and claim CFR with the map. \nBesides, the regular meetings, interactions with the forest and district administration are being continued \nbecause the implementation of FRA has to be recognized by the government. FRA guidelines are not being \nfollowed. The process is not done correctly by the government hence people have to repeatedly go for the \ncorrection of land records, ensure their representation in the Sub Divisional Level Committee (SDLC) and \nbringing issues back in the village. \n  \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1: Shortfalls \nThe starting of developing the audio-visual materials have been delayed due to Covid pandemic. \n \n \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 \nTo create livelihood opportunities for the communities living in and around the forest  to  build their \nresilience and encourage conservation of forests and the surrounding landscape. \n \n \n7.2.b. Objective 2: Principal accomplishments \nThe outcomes of the livelihood activities have surpassed our own expectations. People were mobilised in \n25 villages to form clusters for community level farming. Around 680 families involved in farming have \nreaped a harvest in jute, mustard and vegetables.  \n\u2022 300 families were involved in Jute farming and each family had made an average additional \nincome of Rs.27,000 \n\u2022 350 families were involved in mustard farming and each family had made an additional income \nof around Rs.10,000 to Rs.12,000. The marketing of mustard oil is in the process. People in these \nclusters have brought 330 acres of land under mustard cultivation. \n\u2022 35 families in Nimati village were involved in vegetable farming and each made an additional \nincome of Rs.600 \nAll of these are additional income for the families because earlier they used to grow rice and then the land \nremained unused for the rest of the year. Rice is mainly grown for sustenance. Most of the villagers in the \noperational area are daily wage earners. On an average they earn around Rs.300 per day as labourers. \nUsually they get 4 months of work in a year which earns around Rs.36,000 annually per family. The clusters \ninvolved in farming have been able to make some additional income on top of their annual income from \nlabour work  because of this livelihood initiative.   \nThere have been some farmers who grow jute for which they  take a loan of Rs.400 for a bigha (0.33 acre) \nfrom the money lender. And farmers who were involved in commercial mustard farming used to take a loan \nof Rs.5000 to 600 per  bigha (0.33 acre)  for the initial input costs. This year the situation has changed or \ngot better in a way because the cluster got the seed and other input support for farming and also had a good \nincome from the harvest.  \nApart from the farming initiatives, 2 nurseries have been raised in different villages with a total of 80,000 \nsaplings of local indigenous varieties from the forest. The plantation will happen in monsoon season on all \nthe degraded lands along the customary boundaries of the forest villages.  \nFormal meetings with all the Gram Sabhas in 25 villages happened and resolutions were passed in order to \ninitiate the farming and plantation work in the forest villages. Several follow up meetings with the Gram \nSabha and the clusters had been carried out to start the newly adopted livelihood initiative. Besides, some \nworkshops on the technical aspect of organic farming were also organised in 25 villages with the farmers \ninvolved in clusters. \n  \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2: Shortfalls \nWe are a bit late in terms of plantation effort because the seed collection was delayed  due to the Covid \ninduced lockdown. Plantation is a time sensitive work. We missed the first plantation time because of the \ndelayed seed collection and we had to wait for the next plantation time. On top of that the first batch of \nsaplings got destroyed by the elephants for which we had to change the location of one of the nurseries.  \n \n \n \n \n7.3.a. Objective 3 \nTo develop a new rung of leadership from the youth (12 to 18 years) through an education that is rooted in \ntheir socio-cultural-ecological context and empowers them to develop self-reliance and live in their \nculture with dignity. \n \n \n7.3.b. Objective 3: Principal accomplishments \nWe could not organise any formal workshops in the initial months of the project due to Covid pandemic. \nHowever,  several rounds of discussion have been done with the adolescents and youth (aged between 12 \nto 18 years old) both including men and women in different villages. Based on those interactions we are \nnow developing the learning modules which will be completed by April, 2022.  Due to the enthusiasm \nfrom the community we increased the learning centre from six to seven. Selection of teachers through an \ninterview process from the community has been done. We are in the process of buying one desktop for \neach centre. We observed the FRA day on December 18th in which people from different villages \nparticipated, and community members of different tribes presented their unique cultural performances. \n \n \n7.3.c. Objective 3: Shortfalls \nWe could not organise any formal workshops on planned time for developing the learning modules due to \nthe Covid pandemic. However, our experts (resource persons) have visited all the targeted villages several \ntimes in order to interact with the women and youth groups in the process of dev eloping basic learning \nmodules.  \nNo school level competitions could be done because schools were closed due to the Covid-19 induced \nrestrictions. \n  \n \n \n \n8.", "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project?": "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project? \n1. In the process of nursery development, we have learned that forest villagers want indigenous \nvarieties that grow naturally in the forest for their nurseries unlike timber that is always promoted \nfor plantation. The forest villagers believe that plantations of more indigenous variety can restore \nthe degraded forest patches and eventually reduce the human-animal conflict.  \n2. We have found that the youth group in the villages are very enthusiastic about computer \neducation.  \n3. We also learned that cluster farming can have a huge impact on the income of the families. \n \n \n \n \n9.", "How will your team use this information to change the way you work?": "How will your team use this information to change the way you work? \n1. We are raising only indigenous varieties in our nurseries. There is no plan for timber plantation. \n2. We have incorporated computer learning in all 7 centers. All centers will start with one desktop \neach this year. \n3. The huge production of mustard and jute has made us think of exploring the scope of value \naddition and marketing initiatives. We have already started talking to the clusters on the \nmarketing efforts. \n \n \n10.", "How will you share what you have learned inside and outside your organisation?": "How will you share what you have learned inside and outside your organisation? \nWe will discuss the processes and outcomes with our other partners.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nThe Oak Project: As part of our ongoing efforts to create a social registry for migrant workers, our \nJan Saathis registered 1,30,859 migrant workers across sources and destinations on the Jan Saathi \nmobile application during the project period, out of which 70906 women have been registered on the \nportal. These workers were also provided with pre-departure and post-arrival training sessions. In \nthese sessions, the workers are informed about their rights and the mechanisms in place to safeguard \nthem. The workers are also informed about the various entitlements that they can access at the \ndestination and source they are currently present. \n \n \nSocial status of families registered in West Bengal \n  \nThe team has been successful in facilitating 78,153 scheme applications for various households. Out \nof these, till May 2022, 70,201 applications have converted to benefits of which 36,154 are for \nwomen-led households. The application-to-benefit conversion ratio is (~89%) which is similar to \nwhat was envisaged at the start of the program.  \nOverall MRC Progress: In the MRC program, running across 13 states, we have currently reached \nout to 28,22,497 households since October 2020, they have been registered with the Migrants \nResilience Collaborative. Aligned with our strategy to register women as primary respondents for the \nhouseholds, 40% of households have a woman as the primary respondent in May 2022. \nOur Jan Saathis uses the mobile application to check eligible schemes for registered migrant workers \nand facilitate applications for such schemes. The Jan Saathis also tracks the delivery of benefits for \neach application they help submit. The major schemes that we focused on in West Bengal were \nLakshmi Bhandar, Krishak Bandhu, old age pension, widow pension, disability pension, Bina Mulya \nSamajik Suraksha Yojana, BOCW, PMSBY, E-shram, BMSSY and Swasthya Sathi.  Our team was \nable to facilitate and implement all the above-mentioned activities smoothly through the constant \nsupport of the district labor officials.  \n\n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \nTill May 22, 26.6 lakh scheme applications were facilitated and 22.20 lakh benefits were received in \nthe MRC program, working across 13 states The focus in many states was in ensuring the filing of \napplications for the community instead of only registering them. In May 2022, the major schemes \nunder which applications were filed include EShram, PMSY , Ayushman Bharat, BoCW cards, PM \nKisan Saman Nidhi, PM Awas Yojana, MGNREGA and work related to ration. \n  \n \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n1. Due to the second wave of Covid19, our operations were halted from April 21- June 21. \n2. Political interference at the local level affects operation. Despite securing support from \nGram Pradhan, the team often faces resistance from other members of the same political \nparty. \n3. The MRC during the initial days did not receive support from the community. They \nbelieved that we had come from NRC and harassed our team members.   \n4. Government does not accept offline application forms. The only medium to submit the \napplications is through Duare Sarkar camps. Currently, there are no mechanisms for \nsubmitting the applications for state-specific schemes online, so the team has to wait for \nduare Sarkar camps to happen in order to submit the application form. This makes availing \nthe entitlement lengthy. \n \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective \nEnabling responsible recruitment \n \n \n \n7.2.b.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nThe Oak Project: In West Bengal, the team has been getting access to new construction sites under \nMission BOCW. Mission BOCW has been largely successful and we have further streamlined \nimplementation support on sites to ensure workers can access social security support, keeping the \neffect of on-site operations to a minimum. The team in Kolkata engages in 2 sites that come under \nand till now, 1087 applications have been submitted for 355 unique workers and 751 benefits were \ndelivered for 348 unique workers at construction sites. \nOverall MRC Progress: In the last year, the team has focused on Mission BOCW which is a \ncoordinated effort with the government, private sector, and civil society to help migrant construction \nworkers and their family\u2019s tide over the crisis. Through this campaign, we aim to register one million \nconstruction workers by December'22 in 100 cities and districts of 12 states of India. \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \nThe targeted outcome this year was to get labor responsibly recruited to Industries but as we \nproceeded, we understood that to responsibly recruit labor we need to first initiate partnerships with \nthe industry to gain access to sites. Hence, we started to focus on Mission BOCW as a stepping stone \ntowards the larger goal of responsible recruitment which will be an eventual outcome of the same.  \nWe are currently engaging with 11 industry partners (employers) across the textile and construction \nsectors. These include names Such as BCI, CREDAI, BCI, HDFC, Godrej and Tata Realty. In \nPartnership with HDFC capital, we are in the process of launching an initiative aimed at recognizing \nand rewarding the industry\u2019s best practices, which in turn will ensure proactive engagement of real \nestate companies in providing social security for the construction worker\u2019s compliance at the sites \nunder HDFC capital. An LOI has been signed with the CREDAI National (The prime industry body \nof construction developers), through which they will help with onboarding developers onto the \nMission BOCW-where social security entitlements will be facilitated on-site at all MRC destination \ncities. \n  \n \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n1. Gaining access to sites has been a major challenge.  \n2. Even after receiving permission for the sites, the onsite managers create hindrance in \nregistering the workers for BOCW. \n3. Lack of proper documents (Aadhaar card, bank details etc.)  with the workers at \nconstruction sites limits our ability to facilitate social security entitlements. \n4. Besides, the presence of promoters of real estate companies/ site managers often hinders \ninteraction of Jan Saathis with the workers and the ability of the workers to share their \nproblems freely. \n5. The onsite managers expect that the scheme's benefits should be given immediately to the \nlaborers, which is not possible as the delivery is determined by the processes at the Labor \nand other relevant departments. \n6. BOCW and many major schemes are not applicable for inter-state migrant workers in West \nBengal. A number of workers in Kolkata, especially in the construction sector, are inter-\nstate migrants which could not be benefited due to the limitations.  \n \n \n \n7.3.a.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nThe Oak Project: In the last year, 797 calls were received on the helpline and across all districts, a \ntotal of 97 cases were registered in the supported districts and 41 cases have been resolved till now. \nThe team has received 4 cases of accidents at the workplace, 1 case of minimum wages, 1 case of \nforced labour, 91 cases of non-payment of wages. The team has currently recovered the wage of \naround Rs 2,34,492. The remaining cases lack evidence and that\u2019s why they are not closed yet. The \nteam is continuously working on promoting helpline services in the communities and labor nakas \n(labor hubs).  \nWe have held awareness sessions for 39,822 workers in the workplace about their rights and \nentitlements through pre-departure and post-arrival training. Our target was 80,000 but due to gaining \nlate access to sites as covid 2nd wave was then prevalent, we will cover the balance 40,000 workers \nin year 2 and 3.  \nOverall MRC Progress: In the MRC program, running across 13 states, 34,665 calls have been \nreceived on the helpline since October 2020, in which 6035 cases have been registered. 1127 cases \nwere received from the field team and 4,908 were received through Helpline till May 22. Out of the \ntotal cases received till October,3,256 cases have been closed after adequate interventions. Different \nstrategies have been adopted to popularize the helpline. Besides IEC materials, wall paintings have \nbeen used an innovative strategy so that the workers get to know about the helpline. The helpline \nhas received calls from over 425 districts across the country. \nWe have hired lawyers who are helping our team and stakeholders in implementing and imbibe SOPs, \nenabling and capacitating the system towards transformation- Exposure to labour departments, \ncommunity volunteer building relationships and sensitization of field and central teams. We have a \ndedicated lawyer in each state. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n7.3.c.

Collecting evidence from the labor  for the cases to proceed with them legally has been a \nchallenge, as the labor is not fully aware of how to collect proper evidence and this causes \nobstacles in solving the cases.  \n2. Even though the workers are fully aware and all the evidence is in place , the workers do not \nwant to fight against the contractor as they are scared that they might not find work in the \nfuture.  \n \n \n8.", "Significant changes": "Significant changes.

Objective 1 \nTo empower communities through access to information and entitlements with the help of the \nSEWA Shakti Kendras [SEWA empowerment centres] in Jharkhand and West Bengal \n \n \n7.1.b. Objective 1: Principal accomplishments \nThe experience of SEWA and similar organizations demonstrate that workers in the informal economy, \nespecially women, benefit from organising themselves to identify their status as workers and demand \nbetter working conditions and fair wages. Organizing enables an otherwise scattered labour force to \nnegotiate with employers and decision-makers from the government. It is to this end that SEWA works \nwith women in the informal economy to improve women and girls\u2019 agency and visibility, autonomy and \nsecure their socio-economic rights. The programme across two states of Jharkhand and West Bengal \nworks to address the systematic issues affecting women and girls and to advance the rights of these \nwomen as informal women workers under the gamut of the unorganised sector. \nThroughout the past fifteen months, the perils of COVID-19 continued to present multiple challenges to \nour members, through the second lockdown imposed in the months of April-May 2021, followed by the \nthird wave of COVID inflicted field restrictions in January-February 2022. For West Bengal, this situation \nwas also politically charged in the state with the Legislative Assembly election throughout March and \nApril 2021, which led to a fairly slow start to programme activities as per the Workplan. In Bengal, the \nsituation was aggravated by another challenge: the floods in Malda. Almost 15000 community members \nin Malda faced flooding during the rainy season. Meanwhile, in Jharkhand, the situation was aggravated \ndue to a lack of proper channels of communication, which got lost due to the sufficient infrastructure \navailable for our members. \nThroughout the year, the grassroots leaders and organisers in both states have worked dedicatedly towards \nincreasing engagements resulting in outreach: \nTrade West Bengal Jharkhand \nBeedi workers 21000   \nDomestic workers 4000 1600 \nAgriculture   3907 \nConstruction   1400 \nOthers   587 \nTaking the membership base across both states to 32494, increasing the membership by 20% in year 1 of \nthe current grant.  \nThrough the experience of engaging with informal women workers, grassroots leadership has emerged at \nthe CORE for any programme development or strengthening of the SEWA movement for SEWA Bharat. \n \n \nAagewans (SEWA grassroots women leaders) are the elected leaders in the SEWA movement. They are \nthe face of SEWA. The Program aims to increase the bargaining power of these grassroots leaders by \ndeveloping their capacities to provide leadership in their communities and understand issues surrounding \nthe women in the informal economy be it in trade, occupation, rights and access. Due to their local \npresence, Agewans are often approached by SEWA members and the larger community to help them \nregister for government schemes or benefits, as well as to negotiate wages and issues with employers. \nAagewans play a vital role in the SEWA movement as they are the bridge between the Government, \ncontractors of work and all the women working in the informal economy to ensure the last-mile delivery \nof services and support to them. Therefore,  facilitating their capacity building and knowledge \nenhancement around SEWA \u2019s work is our foremost priority.  \nThe team in West Bengal focused the interventions on activating aagevans towards an action-oriented \napproach and emphasised the need to reach out to more women workers. Whilst in Jharkhand, which is \nrelatively a newer intervention area, the focus is to further strengthen the collectivisation process led by \nthe aagevans so that they can lead the trade-specific advocacy and government liaisoning. \n  \nCapacity Building of Agewans through Agewan Vikas Training \nThroughout the year from March 2021 onwards, the Agewan received various training and knowledge \nbuilding sessions. In Jharkhand, two batches covering  40 Agewan completed their Agewan Vikas \nProgram training course which focused on the following modules (1) SEWA Ideology (2) Importance of \nUnion & Trade organising (3) Identifying issues and taking community issues (4) Trade committee.  \nAcross West Bengal, the training(s) was conducted to equip 106 agewans with the knowledge and skills \nrequired to become efficient leaders at the community level.  \nFor the Bengal team, post the training the agewans from every block prepared a three-month plan in which \nthey included linkages with government schemes like Swasthya Sathi, Ration Adhaar link, preparing a rate \nchart for domestic workers etc. This made the process of evaluating the growth of aagevans across the year \nmore thorough.  \nVarious inputs given to the aagevans throughout the year, in the form of training(s), sessions or \ndiscussions have led to not only increased awareness of aagevans among the community members but \nresulted in several actions being taken by aagevans that manifested their leadership qualities.  \nTopics Participation - West \nBengal \nTopics Participation - Jharkhand \nAwareness on Skill \ndevelopment and \nAlternative livelihood \n108; KVIC Agewan Vikas Program \nModule training  \n40 Aagewan  \nHealth Awareness session 16; SEWA resource \nperson \nHealth Master Trainer in \nHazaribagh  \n20 Master trainers (The \nAgewans) \nAagewan Vikash 106; SEWA resource \nperson \nTrade Committee \nUnderstanding and E-\nShram Portal registration \nprocess session  \n25 Agewan & 12 SEWA \nJharkhand Staff \nWage code & Social \nSecurity code \n60; Joint labour \ncommissioner \nV .V Giri Trainings  12 SEWA Jharkhand staff  \nPanchayat system 45; SEWA resource \nperson \nEconomic & Social \nSecurity (ITUC-TURIN) \n1 SEWA Jharkhand staff \nNational Rural Livelihood \nGuarantee Act \n45; SEWA resource \nperson \n    \n \n \nPWDV A, 2005 40 Domestic workers; \nprotection officer, \nMurshidabad \n60 Beedi workers: District \nJudge, DLSA \n    \nToday, they have a higher degree of confidence as a result of their training, and their participation has \nincreased in community and trade activities. They are also gradually leading the SEWA meetings held in \ntheir localities, moderating the sessions to the best of their ability. They also assist in the development of \nthe strategy for monthly community and trade events in their respective locations. The agewans are \nfacilitating social security linkages in collaboration with the SEWA Shakti Kendra linkages such as E-\nShram portal registration, conducting Mahila Arogya Meetings and linking communities with public \nhealth services. \nIn West Bengal,  through the above -mentioned training in Berhampore, 4 agewans have taken up the \nresponsibility to conduct unit meetin gs (a unit is a cluster of 20 -30 local women coming together for a \ncommon purpose)  and mobilize the domestic workers who are coming from the outskirts of the city to fix \ntheir rates. Shampa ben and Deepali ben, two agewans (domestic workers) got a chance to take part in the \nSEWA National level domestic workers workshop in November 2021 where they highlighted their issues on \nthe National platform. This knowledge helps them to mobilize others and talk about their demands with \ntheir employers. The domestic wo rkers in Bengal were able to visit the labour department to enrol \nthemselves under Samajik Suraksha Yojana (a social security scheme of the W Bengal government). This \nwas important as otherwise they would not have any Social Security as the state does not recognise the \nDomestic Workers as \u2018workers\u2019 as yet. The Labour Commissioner agreed and committed to helping them \nwith the enrollment. \nIn Jharkhand, the Agewans are representing their trade memorandum to MPs and participating in the process \nof memorandum su bmission. In the years 2021 and 2022, they submitted the advocacy points regarding \nILO Convention 189 (Provisioned work rights of domestic workers: Decent wage, favourable workplace, \nfixed work hours, 4 weekly holidays in a month, no discrimination at the workplace, wage on time)   for \ndeveloping more inclusive policies for domestic workers in the country under the guidance of the National \nDomestic Workers platform. This has garnered the recognition of agewans among key community leaders \nsuch as the Municipa l Councillor. Through the social security sessions, the Agewans now understand the \nimportance of registration of members under the Labour Board according to their trade and have been \ncontinuously engaging with them to ensure all their area members are gett ing registered under the BoCW \nBoard, Unorganised Workers Board and the E-Shram Portal. \nDigital Recognition: Many Agewan represented themselves on many digital platforms in the year 2021 by \nvideo documentation and online session participation, discussing th eir work and their journey as Agewan \nin their neighbourhood as well as at their workplace, and highlighting the conversation on worker rights. \n  \nAagevan led meetings at the community level, \nSEWA Bharat, in West Bengal, has been organising women through uni t meetings and giving them a \nplatform where they can come together and discuss their community -specific issues and address them \njointly. A total of 473 meetings were conducted by 24 agewans across Murshidabad and Malda reaching up \nto more than 10000 members. \nThe various topics on which meetings were conducted included Government schemes like SSY , Lakhir \nBhandar, Duare Sarkar, E-shram card and community level issues including sanitation, safety etc. \nThrough these meetings, it is ensured that women from the community have access to information on \nschemes and services which otherwise they would not be aware of and therefore would not be able to \navail of the benefits covered under the schemes. Being members of the marginalised group, women are \noften exploited in the name of scheme linkages and become victims of fraud. Through these meetings, \nthey are well informed about the schemes which prevent them from falling into any trap. Through the \nmeetings community members have collectively taken up action to protest against low wages and held \n \n \nmeetings with Mahajans to put forward their demands, To ensure good health and hygiene within the \ncommunity signature campaign was held at Suti (block in Raghunathganj) and a letter was submitted to \npanchayat in demand of improving drainage to which the panchayat responded and acted upon. These \nmeetings also enable women to come out of their confined zones and share their concerns in the meeting. \nThis gives them more courage and confidence to interact and express their views. \nIn Jharkhand, the agewans have started conducting meetings in the community on what they learn from \nSEWA and that which need to be reached out to the members. as they are leading meetings in the new \nareas and this is helping SEWA to expand its work and membership in Jharkhand.  A total of 25 such \nwomen are regularly undertaking the responsibilities of an Aagevan forward. \n  \nAwareness programmes conducted by Agewans: \nVarious awareness sessions and meetings were held on topics like government health structure, balan ced \ndiet, vaccination, awareness regarding COVID -19 safety protocols, and the importance of sanitation and \nhygiene in everyday life across Malda and Murshidabad. A total of  10 awareness programmes were \nconducted by agewans in their community, reaching up to more than 500 members across Malda and \nMurshidabad. The programmes were used as a platform to address the myths and misconceptions related to \nhealth practices, and vaccination at the ground level which makes them vulnerable to the diseases but due \nto the intervention of the agewans through the meetings and awareness sessions, our members have become \nsensitised and are taking steps to break the myths and misconceptions. Our agewans have successfully \nreferred 6000 members for the first dose of vaccination and 4000 for the second dose of vaccination. \nIn addition to the ongoing concern about health, many sessions and programmes were also centred around \nthe loss of work and the importance of restoring livelihoods. 10 agewans and 3 youth group members \nmobilized village members in Pathanpara, Lalgola (Block in Murshidabad) and collectively demanded an \nincrease in wages for beedi rolling at the Block level office. The agewans were joined by the other \ncommunity members and other trade unions such as CITU (Centre of Indian Trade Unions). In response to \ntheir demand wages increased from Rs 155 to Rs 165, for every 1000 bidis. This was also supported by a \nlarger intervention to protect the livelihood of the marginalised, SEWA Bharat facilitated linkage with \nMGNREGA; a total of 150 members received work through this. \nIn Jharkhand, the result of a public meeting conducted by the domestic workers in Ranchi, wherein they \ndemanded work in Urban and to start Urban MGNREGA in the city as well, was conducted under the \nNational Domestic Workers platform. Members started getting themselves registered under Urban \nMGNREGA, by the year-end of 2022, Agewan  (Sunita Orain) from Pandra Ranchi reported that along with \nher more than 10 members have received 90 days of Job under Ranchi Municipal Corporation for sweeping \nwork in Vendor Market.  \nMy Fair Home Campaign by Domestic workers  \nBerhampore, Murshidabad \nIncreasing fear of transmission among common people and lockdown rules led to the loss of livelihood \namong domestic workers as most of the employers were not ready to allow domestic workers at their homes \nand as a result, they were deprived of wages, continued to be a persistent problem even during the second-\nwave of COVID -19 pandemic. SEWA Bengal initiated the \u201c My Fair Home Campaign\u201d in Berhampore, \nMurshidabad to promote fair wages and get domestic workers back to work through negotiation with the \nemployers. Through the campaign, 5 domestic workers who lost their jobs due to the pandemic got back \ntheir jobs. \nRina Mondal is one of the Domestic workers who took part in the campaign, After the lockdown was \nimposed due to the emerging second wave of the pandemic she was asked by her employer to not come to \nwork nor was she being paid a minimum wage to support her family duri ng the distressing time. Through \nthe campaign 3 agewans and 2 domestic workers and organisers from SEWA West Bengal collectively \napproached the employers to support her with her monthly wages at the household level. This led to an \nachievement where the emp loyers agreed to support them till the lockdown restrictions were lifted post \nwhich she joined back to work unconditionally. \n \n \nRanchi, Jharkhand \nDomestic workers have been facilitated in understanding their wages according to their work hours and \ndays. Therefore, a regular meeting with Agewan and the trade committee members has been undertaken to \nunderstand how the rate chart should be normally developed by the domestic workers. Therefore a campaign \nwas conducted by the Agewan and Domestic Worker trade group members and trade leaders by conducting \nfocus group discussions in areas from where the domestic workers go to work to different areas. firstly to \nunderstand that in current days how domestic workers are getting their work according to their work hours. \nThrough the focus group discussion, SEWA learnt about their household counts, work hours in each \nhousehold, the amount they receive, number of rooms they take care of, types of service they provide to the \nhousehold, and distance of workplace area. Now in the next phase, the domestic workers will be facilitated \nand mobilised to bring the rates to a common rate so that each can do equal work and get an equal rate.  \n  \nCampaign on MGNREGA:  \nThe \u2018Right to Food\u2019 network observed a 14-day campaign from 15th September to 1st October 2021. As a \npart of the initiative, agewans of SEWA West Bengal took part in the campaign. In Murshidabad and Malda \ndistricts SEWA members conducted poster campaigns and submitted letters to the nodal officer mentioning \ntheir demands of get ting work under the MGNREGA scheme thereby letting the voices reach the duty \nbearers and making them accountable.  Around 250 members received work through this campaign \nwhich ensured their Right to livelihood. \n\u2014---X\u2014--- \nEngagement with Y outh  \nThe inclusion of youth in transforming their communities by organizing them into groups is fundamental \nfor the growth and development of the community as a whole. Years of Engagement with the youth have \nhelped in developing the next generation of leadership at the grassroots who are capable of addressing their \ncommunity-level issues and advocating for the fulfilment of rights of women involved in the informal \neconomy thereby leading the SEWA movement forward. The training(s) and meetings have provided them \nwith a platform to learn new skills, build upon their knowledge and be aware of their rights and entitlements \nIn Jharkhand, as a part of learning from Bengal, local youth groups have been created to recognise their \nissues, address them and develop the second SEWA generation. Thus from 2021 SEWA Jharkhand started \norganising the adolescent girls as well, started conducting informal meetings with them in their area to \nknow them more and to also know what they know about informal work, SEWA as a movement of women \nworkers and the challenges their mothers face to earn a decent work and remain resilient at times of extreme \ncrisis like the pandemic or flood. For them, it was not new to see their mother gathering for meetings, and \ndiscussions, under the SEWA banner, so the Adolescent girls were well aware that their mother worked as \na domestic worker, construction worker and agriculture worker and they are a member of SEWA and their \nmothers are organised by SEWA for their trade righteous and issues. so understanding SEWA was not hard \nfor them. During their, meetings they are encouraged to bring us their issues as an adolescent like \nmarriageable age, Sexual and Reproductive health, choice in life, education, skill and employment. \nToday in both the districts in Jharkhand, Ranchi and Hazaribagh 45 adolescent girls are part of SEWA now \nand recently by the end of the year 2021 formal meetings were conducted in both the district SEWA office \nfor the orientation of SEWA work and to find opportunities to know how to work with the Adolescent girls \nin Jharkhand. The girls were started involved in KOBO tool training (Data collection training) where they \nwill work on surveys in future to be conducted by SEWA.  \n  \nYouth Group meetings and Training \nWhile SEWA historically considers itself at the intersection of the labour movement and the women\u2019s \nmovement, the expansion of work under the Youth leadership development program has allowed us to \ndeepen our involvement in these movements through the adoption of new praxes, as well as increasing \n \n \nour integration into work around public health. We do this through expanding our core approach of rights-\nbased mobilising, and building on it through the incorporation of voices and agency of young girls who \nthen join the labour movement and the women\u2019s movement as empowered actors, right from the onset. \nKey activities that the youth girls have engaged in have been consciousness -raising and mobilising for \ncommunity issues. These have included developing a narrative around issues that young women and girls \nface regard ing health, autonomy, livelihood, and financial independence. Additionally, the girls have \nlearned how to mobilise peer groups to advocate for changes in their socio-economic conditions e.g. access \nto COVID and Polio vaccination camps, ensuring police main tained safety during the lockdown and \nlobbying for access to services and resources as per their due. They leveraged their newly acquired digital \nfluency to ensure continuous consciousness -raising amongst their peers and within their communities, \nthrough the era of social distancing. They further used these new skills to engage with relevant stakeholders \non Facebook and Whatsapp groups, and keep the spotlight on their issues, even when COVID threatened \nto displace them. \n  \nIn West Bengal, the youth group members conducted meetings on community-level issues that affected the \nlives of the youth within their community like early marriage, menstruation, hygiene and sanitation. Over \nthe grant period,  36 such meetings have been conducted. They have been involved in  raising awareness \nabout various issues like organising campaigns against child marriage. There are at present 9 active groups \ncomprising 126 members across Murshidabad and Malda working towards transforming their communities \nthrough youth-led advocacy.  \nSince young girls from Murshidabad and Malda are affected by issues of child marriage, sexual harassment, \nand increasing dropout, it was of primary importance to address the issues by making them aware of their \nrights. Total 5 training(s) have been organise d in collaboration with other organisations like Praajak and \nBhavna network through which 126 youth group members got sensitized on Protection Of Children from \nSexual Offences Act 2012, different aspects of leadership and gender equality. Through the train ing, the \nyouth group members gained knowledge concerning Child rights and developed insights on how gender \nequality challenges notions of patriarchy and how they can become effective leaders by addressing \ninequitable gender norms. The training(s)led to", "Significant changes": "significant changes which could be observed among  8-10 \ngirls as they would try to speak up at the end of the training sessions and would get more comfortable in \nexpressing their views and opinions with their peers. They would also encourage their peers to come out of \ntheir confined zones and chase their dreams. \nIn Ranchi (Jharkhand), as per demand expressed by the youth regarding their rights to safety, a session on \nlegal aspects and rights of Sexual Harassment and violence at the workplace and a knowledge session series \nhave been started. These adolescent girls are the daughters of the SEWA members of Ranchi. They are \npursuing their education from 10th to graduation. Thus this year SEWA Bharat has started organising them \ntoo to strengthen them and give them an understanding about their mothers working as unorganised workers \nand what hardship efforts they are putting to run and bear the family member\u2019s expense.   Providing them \nwith such knowledge will also help in identifying cases among the adolescent as well as older members \nwhere they do not share about their work issues whether it is wage discrimination, unfavourable work \nconditions or violence. These sessions were facilitated by AALI (Association for Advocacy and Legal \nInitiatives Trust). 31 Adolescent girls are now the 1st batch for this session. These 31 adolescent girls are \nassigned to share what they learnt from the session with other adolescent girls in their area till the next \nsession. Also, 30 Adolescent Girls from Ranchi and Hazaribagh were part of an online data collection and \nresume development training, this was to help them for developing resumes in future when they go out in \nsearch of jobs.  \n9 young girls from the tribal areas have been given training on Sohrai painting. This skill would be enhanced \nto explore earning opportunities from their local art. \nSEWA Bharat in both states recognised the need of establishing Youth clubs as a key component for the \nwork and strengthening of the greater SEWA movement. Each intervention has assisted adolescent girls in \nintegrating into society, developing stronger relationships with family members and peer groups, and, most \nimportantly, developing and appreciating their voice and, in particular, the agency they have over the \n \n \ndecisions that affect their lives. This has benefited SEWA Bharat's efforts to establish youth work as a solid \nfoundation for activities in the states, as well as to improve relationships with community members. As a \nresult, our actions last longer and have a higher impact. \n\u2014---X\u2014--- \nCapacity Building of staff \nCapacity building of local team members is essential to ensure the sustainable impact of any intervention. \nWhether it is via their contribution to constantly readapt program learnings into the program design, or \ntheir support in further building capacities of aagewans, it is the local teams that ultimately are \nresponsible for the success of an intervention.  \nVarious training(s) have been given to the team throughout the year for the team: \n\u2022 Panchyati Raj system \n\u2022 Wage and Social security code by the Joint labour commissioner \n\u2022 Labour rights and entitlements by the Right to Food network \n\u2022 The importance of Gram Sabha by the SEWA National Council \n\u2022 C- 190 Violence in the world of Work \n\u2022 E- Shram portal training \n\u2022 Understanding on New labour codes \n\u2022 Gender, poverty & Unemployment  \n\u2022 Leadership Development \n\u2022 Gender, decent work & Social Protection \n\u2022 Unorganised workers & Labour Issues \n\u2022 Leadership Development and Trade Union leader, by V .V . Giri Training Institute, facilitated by \nthe SEWA National Council  \nFor staff capacity building, the staff also participated in many virtual training sessions, like for building \nknowledge of the Sangathan perspective. International Training course\u201d Economic & Social Protection \nCourse '' These courses have helped the sta ff to understand the SEWA\u2019s work more for the members and \ntheir protection on trade, work, wage & social protection.  \nThrough the training(s) and sessions, the staff were being capacitated with the knowledge and skills required \nfor effective intervention at the field level. Evident changes were visible among the staff members as they \nbecame more informed on the rights and entitlements of the workers employed in the unorganized sector, \nand learnt about the wages and security code which plays an important part in the empowerment of workers \nand ensuring their social security. Knowledge about the Panchayat structure is fundamental in ensuring \naccess to schemes and services at the village level. Further, the information received was communicated to \nthe members th rough aagevan meetings which helped in facilitating advocacy at the Block and District \nlevel as they became conscious of their rights. For instance, In West Bengal, after knowing about the Janani \nSuraksha Yojna through the Right to Food Network training, 3 members received financial benefits through \nthe scheme. Staff are also undertaking regular visits to make the District level violence committee \nfunctional. \nAnnual Planning and Review Sessions \nThis year the field teams across both states actively took the need for having annual work plans as utmost \npriority. Beginning of each year in both 2021 and 2022, the teams prepared annual work plans and presented \nthe same to their colleagues, which in turn contributed to the development of the larger workplan for the  \nprogrammes. The team, along with support from the Central team members also supported the team by \n \n \nundertaking sessions for the development of monitoring tools for different programmes being implemented \nin the states.  \nWorkshop and sessions aimed at review, as well as for the development of the Theory of Change document, \nwhich has been crucial for understanding the work being done, as well as linking the same results to the \nlarger impact aimed through the programme.  \nMonitoring, Evaluation and Learning \nThe focus through this period has been on the development of aagevans, who have started owning the \nprocess and regularly maintain field note diaries to note their work, achievements and challenges. This \nbecomes a repository to build evidence of the aagevan capacity, issues and challenges met at the field \nlevel and the responses of the stakeholders in the local ecosystem. \nAlong with this, a key focus is on maintaining Monthly Progress Reports (MPR) by the state team, which \ncapture all programmes and projects being done in the state. These reports act as monthly trackers for all \nongoing programmes in the state and add key inputs to the larger state development plan \nMonitoring visits by the Programme Coordinator, and other programme and project coordinators, to help \nsupport state teams with various inputs needed for the functioning of the programmes, as well as the visits \ndirected towards identifying the needs for state development and prioritisation. These include visits from \ndifferent verticals across SEWA Bharat such as Communications, Research and other teams to help \nsupport the state teams with capacity building with these skills needed towards the strengthening of the \nstate. This allows for teams to continue with regular fieldwork while also understanding the larger motive \nbehind doing the activities. Input sessions with Senior leadership have also been a key input toward \nprogramme strengthening and state development. \nSystematized and regular maintenance of monitoring mechanisms and means of verifications allowed for \nefficient tracking of work: \n\u2022 Maintaining Minutes of meetings \n\u2022 Excel sheets and Google Drives to maintain the SSK data \n\u2022 Reporting of case studies \n\u2022 Reflection sessions \nAll of these contribute to a holistic approach toward state development and building different aspects \nneeded for autonomy. \n  \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1: Shortfalls \nFollowing the announcement of the second lockdown, the team shifted quickly to online modes of \ncommunication, meetings, and other activities. Although the staff was acclimated to online sessions, the \nuptake was accompanied by the time required to adjust. \nSEWA believes that a key component in the work aimed at aagevan development is the component of \nexposure visits, which could not be undertaken in both states due to lockdown restrictions, and this added \nto aagevans taking time in owning the entire process of becoming change agents for the community, and \nfully transforming into their leadership roles. \nOverall, we noted a slowdown in activities, which we believe is related to mental fatigue among the staff \nas a result of stagnant work and delayed processes, which has resulted in a lack of enthusiasm and interest \nin the work, particularly with field-level operations, which are becoming more difficult due to continued \nCOVID restrictions and are exposing the underlying vulnerabilities among our members. This disrupts a \ngrassroots people-based organisation, slowing down the program's progress. \n \n \nAs a result, such situations are handled with a thorough engagement with the desired outcome and \nreflection sessions, which allow teams to revisit the objectives of engaging in activities that could become \nmonotonous. \nFor Bengal, the shortfall is due to the ongoing deterioration of beedi workers' conditions, the adoption of \nthe labour code, and other factors that have demotivated beedi workers and aagevans. As this appears to \nbe a setback for years of advocacy and interaction with our members, who are now suffering as a result of \npolicy changes and a decline in beedi work in the country. \nJharkhand observed that, despite having digital tools offered to Aagevan, frequent monitoring of tool use \nbecomes difficult, and its maintenance has become an additional duty, aggravated due to a lack of \ninfrastructure and public resources. \n  \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 \nTo empower communities through access to information and entitlements with the help of the SEWA \nShakti Kendras [SEWA empowerment centres] in Jharkhand and West Bengal \n \n \n7.2.b. Objective 2: Principal accomplishments \nSEWA operates empowerment centres known as SEW A Shakti Kendras in all districts across the two \nstates. SEWA's presence and operations in communities are anchored on the SSKs. They connect \ncommunity people with government programmes and schemes related to microfinance, health, job, and \nskill development opportunities, and they provide resources, support, and information to women for their \neconomic and social growth. The SSK is also important as a last-mile delivery mechanism for social \nsecurity and welfare systems, supporting women and their families in accessing them. These centres, \nwhich are staffed by a woman from the local community, give assurance and assistance to help women \nnegotiate the application processes and receive public welfare benefits. \nSEWA Shakti Kendra acts as a bridge between the government and the community members. Through the \nSSK community members became aware not only of their rights but also of the way to access them. \nAt present, through the programme, the states have developed around 8 SSKs under the OAK programme, \noverall 9 SSKs at present supported through various programmes. The inputs given have bolstered the \nSSK in ensuring \n\u2022 An increased outreach, covering wider schemes and ensuring maximum benefits are received \nthrough the Kendras, while also including the expansion of services by catering to the community \nneeds through camps, aagevan mobilisation, and door-to-door visits \n\u2022 Inputs towards the development of staff capacity on handling multiple aspects attached to the \nSSK, along with developing the SSK In-charge by identifying young leaders in the community. \n\u2022 Working towards stronger connections with stakeholders, and relevant government departments. \n\u2022 Regularised and centralised database management system. \nThe major accomplishment has been to nudge the SEWA Shakti Kendras towards sustainability and \nensuring by the end of the grant Year 1, 60-65% growth across all aspects mentioned above. \n  \nIncreasing access to Social security schemes through strengthening  SSKs \n \n \nIn West Bengal, over the grant period, 26518 linkages have been facilitated with various social security and \nwelfare schemes through the SSKs across Murshidabad and Malda. The SSKs played a significant role in \nproviding information and enabling access to government schemes and services. Out of the total linkages \ncarried out 6790 linkages have been initiated by the agewans, 2500 by the youths and 17228 by Organisers \nand SSK-in charge thereby ensuring fulfilment of rights and entitlements of the beneficiaries by facilitating \ntheir access to welfar e schemes which is essential in reducing their vulnerabilities and ensuring better \nstandards of living. \nThe impact of the SEWA Shakti Kendras can truly be understood through the instances of benefits received \nby the members and their families: \nBandana Haldar, who is from a small village in Murshidabad's Lalgola block, is a beedi roller; her husband \nis a construction worker, and she has two daughters in school. Due to the pandemic-induced threats of wage \nloss, the family was finding it difficult to spend on their children's education. At this point, she accessed the \nSSK and learned about the scholarship facility available under the SSY programme. She had previously \nbeen affiliated with the SSY scheme, which made applying for the scholarship easier. Her eldest  daughter \nMandira received the scholarship amount after successfully filling out and submitting the form with the \nassistance of the SEWA organisers. She is now able to continue her studies. \nJohra Khatun is a beneficiary of the state-run Swasthya sathi scheme which is a health insurance scheme, \nshe was linked with the scheme in the year 2021. Her husband\u2019 s entire treatment for the hydrocele \noperation was covered under the scheme. \n  \nIn Jharkhand, by linking our members with social security schemes that may cover their trade-related \nissues, over 2500 linkages have been facilitated with various social security and welfare schemes across \nRanchi and Hazaribagh. The members are connected to Building and other Construction workers board, \nUnorganised Workers Board, supported through seed linkage for agriculture worker members and Health \nscheme linkage. \nMore than 1600 forms were received for the BOCW application but after documentation verification, only \n984 forms were filled and submitted and 849 were accepted by the Labour office (Labour office only \naccepts those forms who have proper Aadhar card detail, residential of Ranchi zone, proper bank details \nwithout any IFSC issue if this is fulfilled the forms are accepted ) after the verification and out of it 411 \neligible applicants (Who have already received one benefit but have not submitted the bills of purchasing \ntools and safety kit are not allowed to get the further benefits, not all are eligible for Maternity fund \nbenefit, it is applicable only up to, 1st & 2nd Child, not all are eligible for their children who can avail \nthe scholarship form)filled their benefit form under BoCW and 126 have received their benefit of Safety \nkit and tool kit scheme.  \nApart from BOCW other trades like domestic workers, home-based workers, agriculture workers, forest \nworkers, etc can also get themselves enrolled under the Unorganised workers' board, thus 237 members \nenrolled themselves this year.  \n  \nTraining(s) and Inputs \nMany sessions conducted for awareness of scheme and benefits for linking the members and mainly \nemphasising understanding the importance of each scheme has been crucial, and so far in the last year the \nmembers were connected to several schemes like BOCW, Unorganised workers board, Renewal of \nBOCW, Caste Income residential, PAN Card, Sukanya Samridhi Yojna, Ayushman Card, Agriculture seed \nlinkages, Bank accounts related work and facilitating in other works like online and offline form filling.  \nTraining and Capacity Building of staff: \nOver the years, multiple kinds of training(s) have been identified which are crucial for the staff \n \n \n\u2022 Orientation - a deeper and in-depth understanding of the essence of having SSKs as physical \nstructures within the community, and how they play a vital role in bolstering the SEWA \nSangathan \n\u2022 Needs assessment and Engagement of the community - imperative to understand and develop the \nability to identify members' issues \n\u2022 Digital Literacy \n\u2022 Engagement with government departments - this allows for faster results to be extracted. \n  \nDigital Upgradation and Real-time Data generation \nThe continual upgrade in governance processes, which are now being updated to include digital \ntechnologies, requires SSKs to modernise themselves with digital technology. To standardise the \nprocesses, the SSK has been supported with adequate infrastructures, such as a computer system or a \nlaptop, along with internet connectivity. With a system at the centre, the SSK's process and data \nmanagement have become more methodical. For smooth operation, the team receives continual digital \ncapacity building. With increasing distances between communities and governance centres, SSKs serve a \ncrucial role in connecting community members with various government departments. \n\u2022 Coordination, monitoring and supervision- Using WhatsApp and phone calls, both state teams \nhave been in touch with one another to keep abreast with work progress, troubleshoot when \nhurdles are encountered in the field as well as share positive stories of impact. \n\u2022 Data entry and online form filling- The primary use of technology has been in the data entry and \nreporting process \u2013 both for internal reporting as well as in the process of applying for various \nsocial security schemes in various government departments. \nThis had allowed for the creation of databases which can generate data needed for furthering any social \nsecurity agenda with relevant stakeholders, and allows for SEWA\u2019S internal monitoring structures to be \nstreamlined. The same has been attached to the report. \n  \nSSK acts as a safe space for community women  \nApart from providing information and assistance related to Government schemes and services, community \nwomen also access the SSK to share their everyday problems and seek support in resolving issues at the \nindividual and community level. Each centre thus serves as the neighbourhood hub where the community \nmembers feel free to drop in and seek clarity on a range of issues. The SSKs also engage with youth in the \narea and promote youth groups or Yuva mandals that become active as community-based organisations in \nthe area. They take up issues of hygiene and cleanliness in the area and assist the SSK in conducting various \nactivities. They also support girls\u2019 education, educate and mobilize against early marriages and work for \ngender equality in general. Most importantly, they become stakeholders in the SSK and are trained to ensure \nthe sustainability of the SSK. \n  \nFacilitating access to schemes and services through Home visits \nDue to the pandemic, there were restrictions on group meetings, hence one to one engagement was given \nmore priority. The Aagewans were assigned the responsibility to reach at least 15 to 20 members per day \neither through phone calls or door-to-door visits. Health-related guidelines and videos were shared through \nthe WhatsApp group.  \nThe agewans played an active role in their community during the time of crisis by identifying families who \nneed ration, registering members for vaccination and sensitizing community members on COVID-19 safety \nprotocols. \n \n \nDevelopment of IEC materials: SEWA published a small booklet on MGNREGA to create awareness about \nthe ACT. Through this booklet, women can demand their actual rights to get the food amount from the \npublic distribution system. \nSuch materials act as collaterals for information dissemination, which entail compiling all relevant details \nsuccinctly and interactively which is easy to grasp by the larger community. \n  \nActivities are done through SSK \nSocial Security Camps in West Bengal:  \nThrough Social security camps, community members are provided with necessary information on specific \ngovernment schemes and assisted with linkages. Through these camps, it is being ensured that an \nincreasing number of members can be linked with the social security schemes run by the state or central \ngovernment which can contribute to their well being in the long run.  \nE-shram card \nDuring the grant period,18 camps were conducted across Malda and Murshidabad on the E-shram \ncard which is an initiative by the Government of India which aims to create a database of \nunorganised workers. A total of 3837 members were registered on the portal through the camp. \nSamajik Suraksha Yojna (SSY)  \n2 camps were organized on SSY which is a state-run scheme to integrate the different schemes \nand to offer uniform benefits to all unorganised workmen to help them face every exigency of \nlife. The scheme has recently been upgraded to Bina Mulay Samajik Suraksha Yojna (BMSY) and \nits registration is expected to begin this year.  150 members who were already linked with the \nSSY scheme were assisted through the camp in updating their existing forms. \nFever Testing Camp in collaboration with Health Department \nAs the cases of COVId-19 peaked during the second wave of the pandemic, a fever testing camp \nwas held where frontline workers including ASHA and ANM were present. 23 members of the \ncommunity got tested through this camp. \n  \nGovernment Liaisoning for linkages in Jharkhand: \nMembers visited the Kendras for various linkages such as caste certificates, income-related documents, and \nresidential and PAN Card, but they were referred to Pragya Kendra, a total of 51 services were facilitated \nby the SSK. Under the Anganwadi Centre in Hazaribagh, a total of 121 forms were filled for Sukanya \nSamridhi Yojna, which are still under process. The SSK team ensure regular follow-ups with the Anganwadi \nSupervisor for each case. More than 80 members are linked with the Ayushman Card linkage campaign in \nHazaribagh and 68 members were facilitated in bank account work by SSK. And more than 90 members \nwere facilitated in filling out online & Offline forms. The agriculture workers with several 297 were linked \nwith Block/ATMA/PACS for seed linkage during Kharif & Rabbi season.  \nBy the end of 2021 from November to December, in both the districts again a registration campaign was \nconducted on E-Shram Portal registration and more than 1000 from both the districts.  \n  \nImpact  \nThe SSKs not only bridge the gap between the grassroots and governance centres but also encourages the \ncommunity members to participate in the governance. The centres  also hold continuous community \nmeetings where the members come together and discuss their issues and explore ways to solve them. Along \nwith these meetings, there are various kinds of training to happen at these centres. There are financial \nliteracy training, entrepreneurship development training, digital literacy training, empowerment training \nand workshops educating the members about health, healthy lifestyle and hygiene. It is because of the SSKs \n \n \nthat the centres of governance are accountable and the com munity members are voicing their needs. The \ntraining, workshop, and awareness campaigns by the SSK centres have empowered the women with the \nknowledge of various governance schemes, and skills and boosted confidence throughout the whole \nprocess. \n  \nTeleconsultation - COVID relief support \nDuring the wake of the second wave of COVID-19, healthcare access became difficult due to the \noverburdened healthcare infrastructure. A teleconsultation model was implemented which aimed to \nconnect women in the field with trained medical experts. In this model, the role of aagevan was seen as \nessential as it is only because of her presence that the community members trusted unknown doctors with \npersonal, medical information, especially given the current socio-political climate. Through this \nmodel,  across the two states, 59 aagevans were strengthened as Master Trainers for dissemination of \ninformation in their respective communities, resulting in 13,723 awareness calls being made by \ncommunity members, to a team of 7 active doctors available.   \nA dashboard which was updated on daily basis was monitored by a central health team created, led by \nSusan ben (National Health Coordinator, SEWA) \n  \nWorking in collaboration with Right to Food Network to secure the fundamental rights of life-food \nand work \nSEWA in West Bengal collaborated with the Right to  Food Network to advocate the aspects of Right to \nFood and other government schemes that are directly or indirectly related to ensuring food security. One \nOrganiser from Murshidabad is now being given the responsibility to work with the network activity to  \nensure food security is ensured to the most vulnerable group. As a part of the campaign, help desks were \nalso being set up from where community members can get information related to schemes and services \nprovided by the government. They have also surveyed  to analyse the impact of COVID -19 on the most \nvulnerable section, the findings of which will be used for advocacy at the state and national levels. Through \nthe network activities, members' access to food security is being ensured. \n  \nVLCPC Strengthening  \nThe role of VLCPC is fundamental in making duty bearers accountable for the protection of child rights \nand addressing issues of child rights violations. As the VLCPC meetings could not be held regularly due to \nthe pandemic, the other hand, the child rights  violation cases were also rising. At this point, agewans and \norganisers in West Bengal intervened and approached the committee to regularize VLCPC meetings to \nsensitize the community members to prevent/ reduce the early marriage because during the pandemic early \nmarriage rate was high in West Bengal. 15 meetings were held where discussions centred around early \nmarriage, increasing dropout rate among girls and action plans were formulated to address the issues. \n  \nCapacity Building towards inclusive centres \nThe most important strengths of these SSKs are the human resources personnel that are responsible for \nthe functioning of the SSKs. Every SSK consists of a team of SSK in-charge, Field Mobilizer, Supervisor \nand Aagewans. The SSKs which are close to each other share their supervisor. With a strong monthly \nreporting system which helps the SSK to track their linkages in place, SSKs can function smoothly. The \nSSKs have a grievance redressal mechanism through which the members can solve their grievances if \nany. A continuously developing and evolving database of all the local, state and central government \nprogrammes through which the community members could be linked helps the SSK teams to support the \ncommunity members better. This developing database gives information about the programme, eligibility, \nrequired documents, and the application process too. This keeps the SSKs informed about the \n \n \ndevelopments in government policies and programmes through which they could link the community \nmembers. \nDeveloping Youth champions through SSKs \nThe SSK has also evolved as space and medium for nurturing local communities. A recent initiative by \nthe SSK team has been on building the capacity of the daughters of SEWA's members. They have been \ntrained to expand the development work in their communities, and have played the role of building trust \namong their community members towards the services offered by SSKs. \n  \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2: Shortfalls \nThe major challenge both states witnessed was an overall priority shift across the social security sphere in \nIndia due to the ongoing COVID pandemic was towards Health, and every other scheme was halted either \ndue to the closing of government offices, or the importance of Health benefits, which led to a major \nadaptation needed towards centring activities in sync with the Health priority.  \nThis is accompanied by challenges faced by the SSK setup due to external factors, such as:  \n\u2022 Repeated transfer of government officials at block/district level \nAlong with internal challenges, like: \n\u2022 Difficulty in identifying trained staff from the grassroots, with a certain desirable skillset needed \nfor understanding the needs and operations for the SSK and the larger social security ambit in \nIndia \n\u2022 Data entry and monitoring are hindered by infrastructure challenges, and a lack of availability of \nresources, which led to many delays in real-time data generation. \nFor West Bengal, \n\u2022 Social security schemes like SSY could not be accessed for a specific period as the portal was \nunder repair, which led to a hurried and hasty application process, leading to many not being able \nto register in the year 2021. \n\u2022 As the government has started to complete the forms online, E-shram registration was also \nadministered online. However, due to the pressure of many registrations taking place at the same \ntime, the members have returned many times. They were compelled to register in the early \nmorning or late evening. The shift to digital space acts as a hindrance in registering for the \nschemes and services.  \n\u2022 Although the state government introduced the Duare Sarkar scheme (govt at your doorsteps) \nprogram, people are hardly accessing the schemes after submission of the forms regularly. \nJharkhand \n\u2022 The SSK linkage was only started to post the second COVID lockdown. Pre lockdown awareness \nsessions & camps were not conducted due to state guidelines.  \n\u2022 Conducting camps, especially in interior rural areas is challenging for the internet, electricity but \nit is also challenging to bring all the members to Pragya Kendra for linkages especially for \nAyushman card, Aadhar card, caste income residential, as there is a mobility issue.  \n\u2022 The fingerprint issue is decreasing linkages in Ayushman and Aadhar Card \n \n \n\u2022 The BoCW board also asks members to renew themselves every year and to get it done is very \nchallenging to continue members to get renewed thus this year the focus was also to make \napplicants sensitised on getting renewed every year for proper scheme benefit linkages.  \n  \nHowever, all these challenges and shortfalls were addressed at a ste ady pace without avoiding delays in \nensuring the benefits are provided to our members. \n  \n \n \n7.3.a. Objective 3 \nTo collectivise women workers [beedi workers, domestic workers, construction workers, street \nvendors, agricultural workers] to enable them to better engage with stakeholders in the value chain \nfor full employment and have better access to markets and resources \n \n \n7.3.b. Objective 3: Principal accomplishments \nWomen workers in the informal sector suffer from a multitude of challenges, one of which is that their \nwork and their contribution to the labour force is rather unreported, and hence not valued appropriately. \nOne of the ways SEWA has brought recognition to the issues and rights of these women is by the dual \naction of organising and collectivism. This type of mobilisation is guided by two realms that are close to \nthe informal women worker i.e. community based and trade-based.  \n  \nTrade Committee meetings:  \n  \nSEWA Bengal has also formed trade committees for beedi rollers and weavers  and the committees hold \nmeetings and discuss trade-specific issues and jointly formulate action plans to address the issues. A total \nof 5 Trade committee meetings were organised in Murshidabad with  106 members where the discussion \ncentred around trade-related issues including low wages, limited access to healthcare, and social security \nand the formulation of an action plan to address the issues through advocacy at the Block and District level. \nSimilar activities have been conducted in Jharkhand, where Trade committee Groups/Members have taken \nthe issues ahead and an equal amount of time has also been dedicated to creating an understanding of their \nresponsibilities and functions by the committee members to ensure positive impact. The  SEWA National \nCouncil has also guided to make the trade committee members functional by participating in their regular \nmeetings.  \n  \nMulti-Stakeholder Consultations: \n  \nA series of important stakeholder meetings were organised by SEWA in West Bengal with government \nrepresentatives. In Berhampore, a meeting was conducted to discuss trade-related issues of beedi rollers \nwhere the Assistant Labor Commissioner, members of the different trade unions, Mahajan and aagewans \nwere present. A joint action plan was formulated to address the issues faced by beedi rollers. It has been \ndecided that the Unions along with SEWA Bharat in West Bengal will draft a letter and submit it to the \nLabour Minister.  \n \n \nIn Malda, another meeting was organised in  Manikchak, Malda in the presence of Block Level \nrepresentatives from various government departments including NRLM, MGNREGA, and CITU as well \nas the private sector including representatives of Pataka beedi company and Mahajan. This meeting gave \na platform for our sisters to directly share their trade-related issues with a variety of important stakeholders. \nThe stakeholders addressed the issues raised by our sisters and also discussed various skill -based training \nwhich can provide an alternate means of livelihood. \nOn the 23rd of March SEWA Bharat in Jharkhand along with other two organisations, Gharelu Kamgar \nSangathan & Nirmana, stood for the rights of domestic workers to be considered and performed a \ndemonstration in front of Raj Bhavan in Ranchi with the demands.  More than 30 domestic workers \nparticipated in the demonstration and a few SEWA members also spoke for their rights. A demand letter \n(mentioning, the rectification of ILO convention 189 by the Central government and bringing law for the \ndomestic workers in India, decent wage to be provided by employers, social security schemes to be \nintroduced more for the domestic workers and to be treated well with dignity in their workplace) was \nsubmitted to the MPs of Jharkhand. ILO convention points were highlighted.  \nThe National Platform for Domestic Workers (NPDW) provided an opportunity for the domestic worker \nrepresentatives to participate and learn to mobilise and organise domestic workers to stand for their \nrights in Jharkhand . Through the platform, the domestic workers also learnt about their part of the \nresponsibilities to achieve a conducive workplace. In 2021, two domestic workers from Jharkhand, Pinki \nMinj & Swarnlata Devi (Swarnlata Ben is also a state domestic worker representative), along with Anisha \nBen (SEWA Sathi, a domestic worker Mobiliser) participated. The NPDW conducted a two-day workshop \nfor the SEWA domestic worker and facilitated conversation on minimum wage, rate chart and social security \naspects. A few highlights of the workshop: \n\u2022 The domestic worker representative had to present their work done in the state and it was decided \nto mobilise in new areas/basis through which 300 new domestic workers will be organised in \n2022.  \n\u2022 Through the NPDW, SEWA Jharkhand is now able to connect with other organisations working \nfor the domestic workers and raising voices in front of the government for the domestic workers.  \n  \nPromoting Alternative Livelihoods: \nWest Bengal \nOrientation on short term training courses under Gramdyog Vikas Yojna, KVIC  \nAgewans and community members were oriented on various short term training courses under Gramodyog \nVikas Yojana. Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) is a statutory body under the Ministry of \nMSME, Govt. of India that works towards providing employment, producing saleable articles and creating \nself-reliance amongst the poor and building up a strong rural community spirit. The meeting was attended \nby agewans and community women as well as youth group members from all blocks of Murshidabad and \nMalda. \nSkill-based Training \nSEWA Bharat in West Bengal has been running SEWA Youth Resource Centres in Murshidabad focusing \non providing alternative livelihood training (mainly tailoring) to get young girls out of beedi rolling. In both \nSYRCs, one special class has been added for advanced training. In the 2021 -22 financial year, 198 girls \nreceived tailoring training. A total of 51 girls have moved completely out of beedi rolling and into garment \nmaking.  \nEncouraging Social Entrepreneurship  \nTo promote sustainable livelihood, SEWA Bharat in Raghunathganj block with the sup port of a locally \nplaced SBI fellow initiated a project on small scale production and marketing of a snack item locally known \nas Nimki, currently, 3 women are being supported in running this project and scaling it up to a sustainable \nsocial enterprise owned by the community women. \n \n \nJharkhand \nA discussion on alternative livelihoods with agriculture workers cum forest worker members, aagewans and \nadolescent girls yielded a few opportunities - such as producing leaf plates, engaging in animal husbandry, \nand organising skill training for adolescent girls.  \nBiodegradable leaf plates and bowls \nIn the Daru Block, a 10 group of agriculture worker-members developed a team to work on leaf plates and \nbowl stitching during leaf season and the local SEWA team will explore market linkages with local vendors \nin Jhumra. A demo with ten women was conducted in September-October, 2021, right before Dusherra Puja. \nThis was the first opportunity for those 10 women to make a living using locally available resources. This \nwas a big motivation for the local team as well - setting an example of nurturing the local economy. This \nopportunity will be explored further to check for viability and scale.  \nAnimal Husbandry \nExploring further livelihood opportunities within the agriculture secto r is one way to go - in Hazaribagh, \nAnimal husbandry work is of equal importance as the women struggle with good practices when it comes \nto cattle rearing (cow, goat, buffalo, hen). There is substantial scope for augmenting the existing incomes \nof women engaged in animal husbandry if such practices are adopted. Currently, bringing their animals to \nthe veterinary doctors is a challenge and has caused animal deaths in many cases. In late 2021, SEWA \nBharat started a program to develop 10 Pashu Sakhis in Hazari bagh. These Pashu Sakhis from different \nvillages can then cater to SEWA members in keeping their goats healthy by providing first aid and guiding \nthem and in preparing good quality fodder (Pashu Aahar) for them. SEWA Bharat also called in an expert \nteam from Bihar that visited Hazaribagh in December 2021 and February 2022 and a 10 -day session was \nconducted consisting of both a classroom session and field exposure. Today,  the 10 Pashu Sakhi are actively \nworking in their local and neighbouring villages. Incr ease of monthly income in the range of INR 900 to \nINR 1500 has been reported by the Pashu Sakhis.  \nSkill Training for Adolescent Girls \nThe team in Hazaribagh has recently begun to work on the skill development of Adolescent girls to prepare \nthem for connecting with income sources while they are pursuing their education. 9 adolescent girls have \nbeen trained in Sohrai painting (the famous Jharkhand art) through one of the renowned organisations called \n\u201c Sohrai Kala Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samittee '' in Hazaribagh. These girls have completed their training in \nMarch 2022 and continue to practice. Once their skill is developed, SEWA Bharat will support these girls \nto market their paintings through \u201cAnubandh\u201d which is an online SEWA e -marketplace. Other interested \nSEWA members too can join this training.  \nEntering the Digital World \nIn SEWA Jharkhand, adolescent girls are today given a platform for understanding digital tools as a means \nof livelihood. 5 girls from Hazaribagh & Ranchi have been trained in conducting online surveys and have \nbeen able to make an earning of more than INR 5000 each. The purpose of providing them with this training \nis to meet the growing need of collecting primary data, through digital means as has been deemed necessary \nduring the pandemic. Many CSOs and government organisations seek such data. \n  \n \n \n7.3.c. Objective 3: Shortfalls \nThe continuous waves of COVID- 19 pandemic and everlasting restrictions and safety guidelines, along \nwith the lack of market and livelihood opportunities have affected the income cycle of the unorganised \nsectors. The situation continued to deteriorate with each passing Day making revenues of livelihood \nscarce and resources limited. \n \n \nThe situation is further aggravated by the ongoing debate around labour codes in India whereby there is \nno concrete support for the workers under the various labour codes at present. Specifically, the facilities \nof the beedi workers have been cut down through the code. They are the victims of the double burden. \nAlthough the state government every six months reviews the minimum wages for the beedi workers. \nHowever, in West Bengal, the minimum wages are fixed through the tripartite meeting and these \nminimum wages are much lower than the government\u2019s fixed minimum wages.  \nOn the other hand in Jharkhand, the major challenge witnessed is the lack of interest of members to invest \nin full-day trainings, as it results in loss of livelihoods,  therefore they do not seem to understand the \nlarger objective behind providing those training, thereby defeating the purpose of capacity building \n  \n \n \n \n8.", "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project?": "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project? \nThough the pandemic has challenged every aspect of our daily lives, and especially that of informal women \nworkers, it has helped us rethink and restrategize design and implementation at the community level.  \n\u2022 The agewans played the role of SEWA\u2019s front line workers, taking on the risk to reach each \nmember to ensure they have access to food and health services during the pandemic. They \nconducted door to door visits while there were mobility restrictions and supported relief work by \nidentifying ultra vulnerable families from their communities. SEWA in West Bengal worked \ncollaboratively with Right to Food Network to advocate for food security of the marginalised. \n\u2022 The shift to the digital modes of work necessitated by the lockdown spurred a change to adopt \ndigital literacy for the local teams and agewans. Online training was organised with agewans, \nyouth members as well as the local SEWA teams to make sure the work doesn't stop. The use of \nvirtual means of meeting such as Zoom and Google Meets was adopted. The agewans also led the \nteleconsultation service provided by SEWA for virtual help and treatment. While the pandemic \nthreatened the necessities including \u2018food, clothing and shelter\u2019, it also made it certain that \nproviding financial literacy to women is paramount if they want to acquire financial management \nskills to help them to cope with economic shocks. \n\u2022 The pandemic exacerbated poverty and hunger pushing people into the vicious cycle of economic \nstagnation. To meet the challenges posed by the pandemic SEWA in West Bengal tried to explore \nopportunities for income generation by collaborating with Khadi Village Industries. This will \nallow the team to increase their focus on the skill development of members and pivot to \nalternative livelihoods if needed.  \n\u2022 With an increase in cases of early and forced child marriages owing to the pandemic, the youth \ngroup members have been vigilant within their communities to prevent child marriages and raise \nawareness among their peers.  \n\u2022 The project enabled the local teams to focus on record keeping and maintaining member \ndatabases. The team has understood the importance of capturing outcomes and not just \noutreach, which is important to constantly question our key assumptions, and use program \nlearnings to inform program design.  \n\u2022 Both states have acknowledged extending handholding support to the agewans and adolescent \ngirls. For instance, this cadre will form the second generation of SEWA Jharkhand which is \ncrucial to ensure the sustainability of development programmes in the state. The team has learnt \nthat it is equally important to collaborate with other local actors - be it government bodies or \nrepresentatives such as ASHA workers, or Elected Women Representatives (EWRs) to create a \nconducive ecosystem.  \n \n \n\u2022 NITI Consultancy, an external organisation was introduced to SEWA Bharat by OAK Foundation, \nto improve internal data systems and monitoring practices.  \n \n \n9.", "How will your team use this information to change the way you work?": "How will your team use this information to change the way you work? \n\u2022 Both teams will focus on improving the interface with government authorities to ensure the \nfulfilment of the rights of beedi workers, domestic workers, agricultural workers and domestic \nworkers. For instance, the West Bengal team will continue to advocate for linking beedi workers \nwith the Provident Fund by conducting stakeholders meetings at the block and district level, and \nensuring strong follow up. Another example relevant for both states is to prepare a comprehensive \nrate chart for domestic workers to reduce exploitation at the workplace and ensure fair wages. \n\u2022 To ensure optimum impact and sustainable change, continuing to invest in the capacity building \nand empowerment of agewans is vital.  \n\u2022 The teams will strengthen collaboration with the District level child protection unit to regularise \nVLCPC meetings at the block level and involve youth groups in creating awareness and \nreducing the rate of early marriage within the intervention area. \n\u2022 It is important to further explore what digitisation means for the informal sector, including the \nimplications of going digital for women workers in the informal economy. The objective here is \nto ensure that they are not left behind and to fully understand the digital space to further their \nlivelihoods.  \n \n \n10.", "How will you share what you have learned inside and outside your organisation?": "How will you share what you have learned inside and outside your organisation? \n\u2022 At the organisational level, the team will ensure that the learnings of the program are introduced \nand shared with aagewans, to ensure that monitoring and learning exercises are democratic and \nmost effective. Similarly, the team will amplify the learnings of the program with other state \nteams, allowing them to exchange best practices, as well as reflect on their program designs.  \n\u2022 SEWA Bharat also organised a webinar partnership with the Ministry of Micro, Small and \nMedium Enterprises, Government of India, titled \u201dWomen Micro-Entrepreneurs in the Informal \nEconomy: Resilience and Growth''. More than 230 persons participated in the event to hear \npresentations by experts in the field including the Secretary, m/o MSME and India Leads of UN \nWomen and USAID. A film featured during the webinar \u201cVoices from the Ground'' showcased \nthe stories of three microentrepreneurs including Basmati ben from Jharkhand who represent \nthousands of women microentrepreneurs who have fought adversities and dreamt of building a \nself-reliant future. Their journeys show that the right kind of support in the form of credit, access \nto affordable childcare and healthcare, linkages to the market, and financial and digital literacy \ncreates a holistic ecosystem for women microentrepreneurs within the informal economy to grow. \nThis film was also shared with the state teams so that the field mobilizers could use it to \nencourage entrepreneurial spirits among informal women workers. \n\u2022 SEWA Bharat runs a fortnightly newsletter that features highlights, achievements and learning \nfrom various programmes and collaborations which is shared with a multitude of stakeholders. \n \n \n \n \n \n11.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \n Summary: \nIn 2022, Pratham expanded into North Bengal with a focus on providing vocational training to \nyouth from tea garden communities in Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, and \nAlipurduar districts. The strategic location of the project also ties well with Pratham\u2019s intention to \nexpand its presence in the East and North-Eastern parts of India. \nKey Outcomes: \nThe program significantly impacted the lives of tea garden youth, offering them stable employment \nwith salaries ranging from Rs. 9,500 to Rs. 14,264 per month, along with accommodation and food. \nCommunity engagement initiatives, including tool-kit exhibitions and camps, fostered trust and \nenhanced foundational skills in reading, math, and English among children and youth in tea garden \ncommunities. Collaborations with organizations like Transform Trade, Swaniti Initiatives, FPA, \nNazdeeq, and KABIL enhanced community mobilization and resource-sharing efforts. Pratham's \nfunding efforts from CSR initiatives, HNIs, and foundations are poised to further strengthen this \nintervention, ensuring sustainability. \nIn summary, Pratham's expansion into North Bengal in its first year of the multi-year grant has \nmade substantial progress towards its objectives of providing vocational training, securing formal \nemployment, and fostering community engagement in tea garden communities. The program has \ntransformed individual lives but also laid the foundation for lasting positive impacts on the region's \nyouth and their families in the coming years of the intervention. \nThe communities residing in North Bengal face precarious living conditions, largely reliant on \nemployment opportunities presented by tea plantation owners. Challenges such as meager wages, \nseasonal employment fluctuations, constraints imposed by plantation owners, and a dearth of \nalternative income avenues have long been endemic. Pratham's proactive approach seeks to address \nthese issues directly by engaging with the youth of tea garden areas. Keeping in mind the niche \nchallenges of human trafficking faced by the tea-garden communities, the program embeds special \ncounseling sessions and end-to-end migration support for youth who get placed out of their district. \nThis in-turns is geared towards tackling the issue of unsafe migration and trafficking. \nPratham's commitment extends beyond North Bengal, as we aim to expand our endeavors \nthroughout West Bengal, informed by our ongoing programs and a deep understanding of industry \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \ndemands and community needs. The set target for the current year involves training 320 youth from \ntea garden regions, endowing them with the skills and knowledge necessary for thriving within \nindustry-specific job placements. The aim is to secure industry-relevant job opportunities for 80% \nof these trained individuals, effectively creating a transformative impact on both individual lives \nand the larger community. \nIn introducing the vocational training vertical within this new geography, we strategically leveraged \nour existing network to establish a presence. The selection of the training center\u2019s location was \nmeticulously considered, with factors like proximity to the tea-garden communities, availability of \nessential infrastructure, and a high demand for vocational training playing pivotal roles in the \ndecision-making process. Prior to setting up the establishment, we engaged with various \nstakeholders, including the local community, government authorities, local NGOs, and potential \nemployers, funding partnerships that would later prove instrumental. \nThe initial activities undertaken were encompassing site preparation, recruitment of staff, \ncurriculum development tailored to local needs, and an extensive marketing and outreach campaign \nto create awareness within the community. To mobilize youth for training, a multifaceted approach \nwas adopted, involving community engagement and awareness drives in collaboration with local \nNGOs. \nThrough this meticulous planning and execution, over the past 10 months, the project has \nsuccessfully trained 321 youths, with 98% of them securing placements across various states, \nhighlighting its impactful contribution to skill development and employment in the region. \n  \nQuantitative Indicators: \nTrade Training \nTarget \nEnrolle\nd \nTraining \nComplete\nd \nTraining \nOngoing \nDropped \nout Trained% Placement \nTarget Placed Placed% \nAutomoti\nve 160 165 138   25 86% 120 92 77% \nHospitalit\ny 160 269 183 33 29 114% 120 143 119% \nTotal 320 434 321 33 54 100% 240 235 98% \n  \nInsights: \nFor Auto 4W trade, students have secured placements in companies like Yazaki India Pvt Ltd, India \nJapan Lighting Pvt. Ltd, Baxy Limited, Best Koki Automotive Private Limited, Osl Tata Motors, \nTopsel Toyota, and A.K Automatics mostly in the manufacturing industry as machine operators or \nassistant technicians. These positions are offering salaries of Rs. 11,000 along with food and, in \nsome cases, traveling allowances. \nIn the Hospitality trade, students have been placed in renowned establishments like Mayfair \nHimalayan Spa Resort, ITC Grand Chole, Hotel Bodhi Palace, The Landmark Hotel, Lemon Tree \nPremier, and Summit Hermon Hotel & Spa. The highest salary offered here is Rs. 14,264/-, and \nsalaries typically of Rs. 9,500, along with accommodation and food for the role of Room \nAttendants. \nThe composition of enrolled students exhibits a gender imbalance, with 173 females and 278 males, \ntotaling 451 students. There is a significant importance in implementing strategies to foster gender \ninclusivity within vocational training programs, aiming to encourage greater female participation. \nFurthermore, the distribution of students based on their highest education qualification illustrates a \ndiverse educational landscape among participants, with 239 having completed their education up to \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \nthe 11th and 12th grades and 185 possessing educational backgrounds ranging from the 8th to the \n10th grade. Consequently, there is a need for customized training approaches that can cater to this \neducational diversity effectively. In terms of economic inclusion, a substantial majority of students \n(242) report monthly incomes below 5,000, emphasizing the program's appeal to economically \ndisadvantaged individuals. Nevertheless, the absence of students with incomes exceeding 20,000 \nsuggests a potential opportunity to broaden the program's reach to participants from a more \nextensive income spectrum. \nPlacements have been made in various states for both the Auto 4W and Hospitality programs. For \nAuto 4W, placements are present in 9 districts across Haryana, Rajasthan, and West Bengal. The \nHospitality program has placements in states like Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Sikkim, \nTamil Nadu, and West Bengal. \nQualitative Insights: The team has made multiple observations during visits to the community and \nindustry partners over the last 10 months. The following are some key insights from their \nobservations: \nCommunity Level Insights \nA team of 8 mobilization mentors conducted various community engagement activities - meetings \nand discussions with ICDS, Self-Help Groups, Parents and youth on a daily basis across the tea \ngarden communities of the 5 districts to spread awareness about vocational education led \nemployment pathways. Such mobilization formats have been used by Pratham across 26 states in \nIndia and have been positively received by different communities. Given the historically difficult \nissues of human trafficking and livelihood related challenges, the community initially has \ninhibitions on trusting the organization and the program being offered. However, consistent efforts \nfrom the team by conducting different awareness activities eventually built trust among community \nmembers. Videos of the center, alumni members who have completed the course and have now \nbeen placed in a formal job went a long way in providing evidence about the program and its \nbenefits. Community members were invited to visit the center, see the program and interact with the \nstudents to help bring in more transparency. Certificate & offer letter distribution ceremony was \nconducted within community spaces where everyone gathered to felicitate youth who have \ngraduated in vocational courses from those communities. These youth became role models inspiring \nothers to take the vocational education pathway and get access to alternate livelihood opportunities. \nA gradual transition from hesitancy and uncertainty to trust and potentially positive pathway was \nobserved in the perception of community members. \n In addition to meetings and discussions, community engagement was driven through the following \ndifferent formats: \nTool-kit exhibitions: The main intent behind organizing toolkit exhibitions is to take the toolkits of \nvarious programs to the youth far and wide and expose them to the opportunities available in \nvocational skilling. By taking the tools to the heart of the community, the idea is to encourage the \nyouth to interact with the tools and know more about this discipline. The goal behind these \nexhibitions is to forge a connection with the local communities and create a presence. These have \nbeen conducted in high-schools, colleges and market spaces within the communities. Community \nvolunteers were engaged in offering support with exhibition displays and spreading the word about \nthis event. The tools were put on display on different tables in a circular structure along with \ninformation pamphlets and Pratham staff available to explain about the tools and their usage. Such \na display format sparked much curiosity among students and community members to know more \nabout vocational training and livelihood pathways available after training. The team received a \npositive response from all visitors leading to many youth enrolling into the program. 10 tool kit \nexhibitions of Automotive 4W and Hospitality F&B trades were conducted across Nagrakata, \nBanarhat, Madarihat-Birpara, Kalchini, Alipurduar, Kumargram blocks in the past 5 months. \nAround 2142 community members including youth and parents engaged in this activity. \n  \n \nOak Progress Report.    5 \nSummer Reading Camps: Igniting community participation and ownership, the summer reading \ncamp program aimed at involving mothers and youth in building foundational reading and math \ncompetencies in children of std. 1-3. Mothers and youth were trained by Pratham mentors following \nthe ASER testing and Teaching at the Right Level methodology who then conducted these camps \nwith children of the tea-gardens. 853 mothers and youth actively participated in these camps \nhelping 1492 children to learn within their own community space across Banarhat Block (21 TGs), \nMadarihat ( 12 TGs), Falakata Block (4 TGs), Kalchini Block (19 TGs), Alipurduar Blocks (8 \nTGs), Kumargram Block (7 TGs). \nEnglish (Angrezi Okay Please ) Camps: These are activity based camps conducted with youth and \nchildren (Std.6-8) to build foundational English speaking and reading skills. 654 youth and 120 \nchildren registered and participated in this camp across Kumargram Block (3 TG), Nagrakata Block \n(20 TG), Banarhat Block ( 4 TGs).  \nThe Summer Reading Camps and English (Angrezi Okay Please) Camps have been impactful \ninitiatives aimed at enhancing foundational skills in reading, math, and English among children and \nyouth in various tea-garden communities. While these initiatives were not supported by the Oak \ngrant component but by other donors, it's essential to note that they are ongoing activities. This \nsuggests a long-term commitment to education and community development in the area of \nintervention. The sustained nature of these programs indicates our aim to nurturing educational \ngrowth and community involvement in the regions mentioned. The continuation of these initiatives \nreflects goal of creating lasting positive impacts on the learning outcomes and opportunities for \nchildren and youth within these tea-garden communities. \nThe larger intention behind all of the above engagement methods is to form groups of community \nvolunteers and set-up social structures which can help sustain the program in the long-run. All of \nthe above initiatives were received positively by the community fostering a sense of hope for a \nbetter future through alternative livelihood pathways. A clear change in perception is visible with \nrespective livelihood pathways and households are finding merit in encouraging their children to \npursue formal job opportunities within/outside the state. \nPlacement Insights: \nPratham has a robust placement and post-placement support system to help youth have a smooth \ntransition for the formal workforce after completing their training. It has partnered with 7000+ \nindustry organizations across India to offer entry-level jobs to its trainees. The industry demand \ndata is fed into Pratham\u2019s database every month to map potential trainees based on their location \npreference. Pre-placement counseling includes an exclusive session on matching expectations from \nthe industry and challenges that a new workplace and migration may bring forth. Trainees are then \nmapped to their preferred jobs and they are hand-held to prepare for interview and final joining \nformalities. Virtual calls are conducted with Pratham alumni already working in the mapped \nindustry properties to offer a real-time experience of the food, culture and living conditions in that \nlocation. This helps bridge the information gap and build trust among trainees who are about to join \nthe same workplace. It also gives them assurance that they have a group of people to support them \nif needed. Placement associates then accompany trainees to their destination location in case they \nare migrating, others are checked upon through phone calls for any support needed during \njoining.  Post-placement support includes a monthly support call from Pratham team to understand \nyouth\u2019s current employment status, challenges at the workplace and requirement of another \nplacement. The data is collected & maintained in the central M&E system. This helps us gauge \nmovement within industries, job changes and overall retention rates. \nPratham understands that our alumni may need support and guidance even after they complete our \nprograms. To this end, we also have set up a toll-free number (1800-12-000-4007) that is active \nfrom 10 am to 6 pm every day. Our program teams actively circulate these numbers among our \nalumni groups to ensure that our graduates are aware of this valuable resource. Whether our alumni \nneed assistance with job placement or any other kind of support, they can reach out to us on these \n \nOak Progress Report.    6 \nnumbers. We make it a priority to respond to all queries within two days of receiving the call. This \nhelps us provide timely assistance and ensures that our alumni continue to receive the support they \nneed to succeed. Batch-wise WhatsApp groups and an Instagram page dedicated for alumni support \nhas also been created to share information and provide support. The Instagram page hosts reels and \ntestimonials of Pratham alumni\u2019s journey and experiences. \nOur placement coordinators and center teams believe in building a strong community among our \nalumni, and to this end, they organize events on special occasions and festivals. These events are held \neither at our training center or at a location in the city, allowing our alumni to reconnect, catch up, \nand share their experiences with their fellow graduates, trainers, and center teams. These gatherings \nprovide a valuable opportunity to network, make new connections, and stay up-to-date with the latest \ndevelopments in the industry. Our alumni cherish these events and look forward to them each year. \nThe above processes of end-to-end assistance for placement and migration have helped build \nconfidence in trainees to join the workforce eliminating fears of unfamiliarity of a different location \nand culture. Given that they have a support network available at the placement destination reassures \nthem of their safety and provision of help whenever required. The first batch of graduates have \nbecome role models for others inspiring them to drive their own career pathways. Here are some \nquotes from the alumni during placement: \n\"Working as an Assistant Technician at OSL Tata Motors is not just a job; it's a stepping stone to \nmy future. I'm grateful for the training and opportunities Pratham provided.\" says Sanjay from \nGuchimari in Kumargram in Alipurduar. \nSunena Shaw, a 19-year-old from Jalpaiguri District, West Bengal, faced financial struggles in her \nmiddle-class family. She joined Pratham's food and beverage service training to overcome idleness \nand improve her communication skills. Despite language barriers, she completed the training \nsuccessfully. Now, she works at Mount Conifer Suites & Spa, earning 7000/- per month with free \nfood and accommodation, proudly supporting her family. \"I learned a lot at the centre. I was very \nalert and attentive during the training sessions. Now, I can proudly say that I am able to support \nmy family as I always wanted. It's a great feeling.\" \n  \nNeed Assessment Study: A quantitative baseline survey was conducted in 73 villages across \nDarjeeling, Kalimpong, Alipurduar, Coochbehar, and Jalpaiguri districts from 23rd- 27th \nNovember 2022. The overarching goal of the survey was to establish the current scenario in the tea-\ngarden region in terms of the need for skill development & alternate safe employment opportunities \nfor youth. In addition to the community survey, an industry survey was conducted to gauge the \nindustry demand for the skilled workforce in Hospitality and Automotive sectors in North Bengal. \nAdditionally, qualitative interviews were conducted with 27 Households across 3 districts- \nJalpaiguri, Darjeeling and Alipurduar exploring the themes like- Employment types & pathways in \ntea-garden communities, Challenges pertaining to current employment, Perception of the \ncommunity on different employment types- formal jobs, labor, self-employment, gig opportunities, \nPerception/opinion of the community regarding aspiration of employment for the current \ngeneration. \nThe above study brought to the forefront the following insights: \n1.Lack of formal employment opportunities in the region, no industry other than tea-garden \nfactories. Tea-factories offer very few job opportunities , most of which are unskilled, semi-\nskilled labor jobs. \n 2.Youth engage/give into alcohol and drugs being depressed about not getting a job. Lack \nof direction and support is leading youth into delusion and often creating suicidal \ntendencies. Skilling will offer a direction/guidance for youth eventually leading to better \nmental and overall health. \n \nOak Progress Report.    7 \n3.Breaking generations of low-income trap for tea-garden families, formal job opportunities \nwill bring in more income and subsequently improve standards of living. \n 4.Lack of career guidance - Youth have a strong understanding of completing high school \neducation (Class 12th) but lack the necessary guidance to make informed decisions about \nhigher education and career path. This has resulted in a significant gap in knowledge \nregarding the wide array of career opportunities that are available. \n 5.Government jobs seem the most aspired option for college graduates - Many young \npeople who manage to complete their graduation in any field have their sights set on \nsecuring a government job. They spend significant time preparing for such competitive \nexams, often spending years. This trend highlights the enduring appeal of government jobs \nwhich is synonymous with stability and security of job. \n 6.Employment Challenges in Tea Garden - Tea Gardens were once a reliable source of \nemployment for families across generations. However, there are now concerns about change \nin ownership which may bring modification in terms and conditions or even the permanent \nclosure of tea gardens. In this context, it is important to explore alternative employment \nopportunities that can provide a more sustainable livelihood. \n 7.Migration among youth has emerged as a prevalent trend in this area where the younger \ngeneration is willing to take the risk of moving out to different regions across the country in \nsearch of better job opportunities. An increasing number of young people from the area are \nmigrating to other regions and finding employment in the hospitality or O&M (electrical, \nplumbing) sectors. Many of them do not have any prior training or relevant skills and learn \non the job. These opportunities are often obtained through personal networks, with someone \nfrom their area having worked there previously \nThese findings have been helpful in getting a deeper understanding of the tea-garden community \nand developing the program delivery strategy. \nCollaborative Value Creation:  \nPratham\u2019s efforts in North Bengal have been further cultivated due to the  partnerships and \ncollaborations that serve as instrumental pathways to attaining the multifaceted objectives of this \nprogram and amplifying the overarching community impact. Following is the overview of the \ncollaborative efforts with some of the Oak partners, and potential funders: \n1.         Transform Trade: Pratham's collaboration extended to partnering with Prasari, the \nimplementing arm of Transform Trade, which operates in various blocks including Malbazar, \nMeteli, Gorubathan, and Kalimpong. The collaboration encompasses joint mobilization initiatives \nin Gorubathan and Malbazar areas. This partnership has already facilitated mobilization of 20 \nstudents from tea gardens such as Kumai, Jayantike, Abheel, and Hope, spanning Kalimpong, \nDarjeeling, and Jalpaiguri regions. \n2.         Swaniti Initiatives: Pratham's partnership with Swaniti will involve a mutually beneficial \nexchange, where they share posters and training material on social entitlement schemes. This \nsymbiotic collaboration will extend to Pratham providing awareness posters about our programs in \nmultiple languages for Swaniti's usage. \n3.         FPA (Family Planning Association): Focusing on women who have faced abuse, a \ncollaboration will aim to pilot a program that equips them with industry-specific skills, and a \nlivelihood opportunity. \n4.         Nazdeeq: The partnership with Nazdeeq is marked by resource sharing for wider \ncommunity dissemination. Integrating Nazdeeq's legal empowerment content into Pratham's non-\ntechnical sessions will enrich the learning experience. Collaboration extends to facilitating \nconnections with groups for mobilization and enhancing outreach. \n \nOak Progress Report.    8 \n6.         KABIL: The proposal of enrolling youth from KABIL's communities into Pratham's \nprogram will introduce a comprehensive approach to sustainable income generation. \nTo bolster our mobilization efforts further, we have strategically connected with local NGOs \nincluding CASA (Church's Auxiliary for Social Action) mostly working in Alipurduar region and \nDooars Jagron. Additionally, we have also received support from Parimal Mitra Smriti \nMahavidyalaya, a local college, that provides an avenue for expanding efforts to the student \ndemographic. \nEnsuring sustainability, Pratham is proactively seeking funding opportunities from CSR initiatives, \nHNI\u2019s, and other foundations. In Year 1 of the project, we were able to secure funding for the \nproject, amounting to approximately INR 21 lakh, from various HNIs based out of the USA who \nwere interested in supporting Pratham's various activities in skill building and livelihoods. \nMoreover, we have secured another round of funding from a consortium of HNIs (called the \nSwedish Partnership) worth INR 7 lakh for the project which will be used in Year 2 of the \nproject.   These efforts are poised to secure the necessary resources to fortify this intervention and \nwe anticipate more rounds of funding to come in for the project in the coming months. \n  \n \n \n7.c. Challenges and obstacles. \n \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nObjective 1 - Industry-Relevant Skills: Implementing this program in the tea garden region came \nwith unique challenges. The susceptibility to human trafficking created a trust deficit, demanding \ncomprehensive counselling for students and families. Sensitizing them to potential risks and \nsafeguards was essential to ensure their safety and well-being while acquiring industry-relevant \nskills. \nObjective 2 - Employment Linkage: Building trust and credibility was crucial due to past negative \nexperiences with NGOs. Establishing commitment, transparency, and tangible positive impact was \nnecessary to overcome this hurdle. Engaging the community in open dialogue and decision-making \nprocesses played a vital role in rebuilding trust and linking youth to formal job opportunities. \nObjective 3 - Support Network: The lack of a physical presence initially affected enrollment rates, \nas potential participants questioned the program's legitimacy. To provide a support network for \nyouth, Pratham responded by creating awareness through alternative means like toolkit exhibitions \nand community engagement activities. As Pratham's presence became more established, skepticism \naround legitimacy diminished, and the support network for youth in terms of career guidance, \nmigration, and placement support began to take shape. \nIn summary, addressing the challenges in the tea garden region required strategic solutions aligned \nwith Pratham's objectives. Building trust, providing industry-relevant skills, and linking youth to \nemployment opportunities were all part of the journey to empower the community and help youth \ngrow in their professional journeys. \n \n \n8.", "Significant changes": "Significant changes.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nPhysical activities started in the first quarter of 2022 and before that activities were limited to \nonline platforms due to Covid induced global pandemic. However, five physical advocacy \nworkshops have been conducted with each hub partner comprising on an average 40 participants \nfrom the respective partner and community members identified during the process. \nNCAS participated in regular meetings for planning review and coordination with hub partners \nalong with annual review of the project. Each workshop was dedicated to explore the community \nissues and how the community can address it themselves based on strength and weakness. \nVulnerable groups such as farmers, women, children, and migrants were identified along with their \nvulnerabilities such as repairing of river embankment, domestic violence, child marriages, gender \ndiscriminations, drinking water, forced migration due to lack of local opportunities, prevalence of \nanemia in adolescent girls, etc. Sundarban is delta region where river Ganga flows into Bay of \nBengal sea. Islands surrounded by saline sea water are the primary characteristics of local \ngeography. Every year during monsoon or cyclone saline water breaks the weakening river \nembankment and enters into agricultural fields and fish ponds destroying not only current crops but \nthe farm itself. This makes the farm unproductive for the next six or more years subject to intensity \nof salinity. This causes huge loss to the local farmers hence; they want to repair and strengthen the \nriver embankment. Farmers are also struggling to access the fair market price of their farm produce \nsuch as fish, vegetables etc. These issues are interlinked and need to be looked at holistically and \necologically sustainable manner. One group has already started the river embankment repairing \nwork as an alternative model rooted in traditional knowledge and practices by planting local trees \nand shrubs tolerant to saline water.  State agencies are concretizing the river embankment and \nmaking the fluid ecological interface between water and land very hard and impenetrable. As an \nalternative to concretization of river embankment we organized \"Rethinking River Embankment\", a \nfield exposure visit for community members and staffs, so that community members can take local \nand ecologically sustainable initiative in their respective villages to protect their life and livelihood. \nWe conducted NCAS's Resource Person's meet for ideation to pursue in the next phase of the \nproject.   \n \n \n7.c.

Community\u2019s voice must be heard and \nrespected at each level of decision-making process in the community-oriented approach. Hub \npartners struggled to reorient themselves towards the community-oriented approach. Their prior \nexperience was limited to the service delivery, reoriented staff and organizational understanding \ntowards this approach was very challenging and particularly to assimilate it. This also raises many \nquestions, how do we understand community-led processes and how to include the community in \nthe process, given that community is not one unit but many groups subject to gender, caste, class \netc. Ensuring community participation in the process has so many contours to negotiate at the \nvillage level. Asking participants particularly women and girls to stay outside of home for a night to \nparticipate in a workshop was a herculean challenge itself to overcome. Another challenge which \nwill take time to overcome is to help the community to realize that this initiative is not to address \nyour concerns but to empower the community to address their concerns. Political contour at the \nvillage level is most difficult to manage and yet partners are struggling to figure out a strategy to \ndeal with this. Physical accessibility of the villages scattered in islands are very limited. There are \nmany villages which can\u2019t be accessed by roads but through boats. There is also sketchy \ninfrastructure such as electricity and mobile networks in some areas. However, this initiative needs \nto address this divide through a very robust strategy to deal with this kind of challenges during \nexecution. \n \n \n8.", "Significant changes": "Significant changes.

Objective 1 \nInstitutionalized practices in partner organizations contribute to strengthened systems to prevent and \nprotect Children and Young People at risk of or affected by unsafe migration and assist sustainable \nreintegration of survivors of trafficking and exploitation. \n \n \n7.1.b. Objective 1: Principal accomplishments \nThe project emphasized importance of gender responsive approach to child protection issues and services \nat the system level to reduce stigma against transgender children and survivors of trafficking and sexual \nexploitation. Partners are collectivized to act as a network advocating for the survivors\u2019 right to accessible \nsupport services and creation of local safety nets for prevention of unsafe migration. The project built \ncapacities of CSOs to use tools for a child centred reintegration process and increased acceptance by \ngovernment duty bearers and service providers.  411 frontline workers demonstrated skills on child \nhandling and dealing with difficult behaviour of survivors following child safeguarding principles through \nuse of tools and learnings from project trainings. 165 children reported their views are sought for and \nincorporated into decision making and care planning. Anecdotes from the children indicate how the tool is \nsupporting them to reflect and share their emotions. \n383 government duty bearers shared positive feedback towards the tools and guidelines developed under \nthis project. Decentralised resource pools at district level are established, providing assistance to victims \nof unsafe migration. 45 inter-agency meetings conducted  and 391 cases were supported through this \ncollaboration, which ensured that the voices of the children are heard and the stakeholders in the \necosystem are involved to ensure that Children and Young People (CYPs) recieve quality services. \nSafeguarding Community of Practice has been established with 54 members to promote safety in the \nprocess of reintegration. 379 child care professionals increased knowledge of Child Safeguarding. CSOs \nwere capacitated to support Mental Health, functioning and Psychosocial Wellbeing of survivors of \ntrafficking. 243 frontline workers increased their knowledge on Psychosocial Resilience Framework and \n220 front line workers are now able to monitor Psychosocial Wellbeing of CYPs including survivors by \nusing tools developed by Tdh, UNICEF and a checklist developed by the partners. \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1: Shortfalls \nMultiple challenges were faced during the implementation of the BECOME Tool by the frontline workers. \nThe main challenges and feedback given on the use of the tool was that it is  too time consuming and many \ntimes Children and Youth in Migration (CYiM) with whom the tool is applied loose concentration or are \nunwilling to tell his/her story to be able to complete the process. \nThe partner organisations are working at various stages of the entire spectrum of the anti-trafficking space, \nand come with different levels of capacity and skill sets. For this reason it was challenging to build content \naround trainings that accommodated the needs of all. \nFor conducting the online training sessions with the frontline workers, one of the challenge was consistent \ninternet  connectivity while the level of understanding among all the frontline workers were not found at \nthe same level. \n \n \nThere could have been a more robust and s ystematic follow up on support for the trained social workers \nwithin the partner organisations by Tdh, however   Tdh faced challenges with high staff turnover of the \ntained social workers within the partner organisations. \nInter-agency resource pool formatio n is yet to be done by 6 partner organisations who are comparatively \nsmall and have a lack of funding and inadequate information on district level resources. It was also found \nthat these organizations faced challenges in finding trained personnel who can develop the resource pool. \nIn Year 1 the overall challenge was the impact of COVID-19 second and third wave in the implementation \nand changes in the FCRA Rules which caused a 6 month delay to starting the field level implementation, \nwhich only started from July 2021 onwards. Hence, most of the partners were not able to complete the \ntarget within the 2022 annual plan. \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 \nCommunity level safety nets are established and functional to protect Children and Youth in Migration \n(CYiM) and support reintegration of the victims of unsafe migration/exploitation/ trafficking in 70 Gram \nPanchayats of 12 districts. \n \n \n7.2.b. Objective 2: Principal accomplishments \n103 multi-sectorial coordination meetings and 76 liasons completed with various formal and informal child \nprotection duty bearers at district and block level. Through these, stakeholders in the ecosystem are now \ninvolved to ensure CYP recieve quality, responsive and stigma-free services. 551 formal and informal child \nprotection duty bearers can identify child protection concerns and are aware of their responsibilities and \nreferral pathway. 290 child protection concerns were raised and referred by the formal and informal child \nprotection duty bearers within this reporting period. \n3544 CYiM participated in leadership training, among whom 1850 children were identified by the partner \nto be supported to join local Child Protection Committees (CPCs) 408 children participated in local child \nprotection committee meetings. 231 child prot ection concerns raised and reported by CYP leaders to \nappropriate authorities. For inclusion of the CYiM in the CPCs, 49 advocacy initiatives were completed by \npartner organisations with District Level Child Protection Society for making the CPC\u2019s function al in the \nareas where they are not functional at all or partially functioning and regarding inclusion of CYiM leaders \nin the CPCs and ensuring child participation. \nPartner organisations met with formal and informal district, ward and village level child protection duty \nbearesand organized consultations at the district level for establishment of CPCs. The CYiM prepared and \nplaced a draft during the VLCPC/WLCPC formation meetings to the Panchayat Pradhan as well for \nformation and inclusion of CYP\u2019s in the CPC meetings. 20 CPCs at village and ward level and 1 CPC at \nblock level have been formed in West Bengal and Jharkhand through initiatives taken by the partner \norganisations. The inclusion of the CYP\u2019s in the CPC meetings helped raise the voices of the children on \nthe issues affecting their lives and to advocate for changes. \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2: Shortfalls \n \n \nThe overall challenge was the impact of COVID-19 and changes in the FCRA Rules which led to a 6 month \ndelay in implementing field level activities.   \nDue to the West Bengal State elections,   the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights and other \ninstitutional structures like Child Welfare Committee and the District Child Protection Unit were not \nfunction for a period of time which m ade the advocacy work very challenging. Advocating for the \nmainstreaming of the tools to be incorporated within the Juvenile Justice (JJ) system in Jharkhand was not \npossible, and  collaboration with the State government of Jharkhand is still ongoing for steering the district \nlevel and media advocacies. The project was able to initiate organisational level advocacy and cluster level \nadvocacy work at the district level; however, the planned state level work could not be achieved. \nThe Empowerplus Application and Livelihood Pre-conditioning could not be dessiminated by the partner \norganisations in 2022as the application is under upgradation for additional features based on user feedback. \nAddirionally once of the core consultants working on this passed away from  COVID and retrieving and \ngetting another person to take the work forward caused further delays. \nAs mentioned above in the principal accomplishment of objective 2, the partner organisations have taken \nup various initiatives at district and local level for making the CPC\u2019s functional in West Bengal and \nJharkhand. Despite the initiatives taken, some CPC\u2019s are still not functional in some of the intervention \nareas for which the inclusion of CYiM leaders in the CPCs and ensuring child participation was not 100% \nachieved as targeted.   \n \n \n7.3.a. Objective 3 \nChildren and Young People at risk of or affected by unsafe migration are resilient to challenge harmful \nsocial norms that perpetuate violence and stigma against the survivors of trafficking and exploitation. \n \n \n7.3.b. Objective 3: Principal accomplishments \nCommunity safe spaces were created in 70 locations for fostering discussions and reflection on gender, \nsexuality and norms. The project engaged 2,054 CYP to increase their knowledge on Gender and \nSexuality, risks and support services. 991 CYiM realized appropriate information related to coping with \ninternal reactions, 334 CYiM reported a sense of calm and decreased negative emotions. 1,415 CYiM \nwere able to identify risks they could face, 1,458 CYiM identified the institutions that can respond to their \nsafety concerns and they know how to approach them, 2,941 CYiM demonstrated critical \nthinking/problem solving skills and 264 survivors and CYiM reported increased connectedness with \npeers, family, and kinship network. The above outputs were achieved as a result of 421 trainings on \nGender and Sexuality, 310 trainings on Continuum of Care Approach, Socio Ecological Approachn of \nMHPSS, and 2464 workshops and reflection sessions with girls and 1811 workshops and reflection \nsessions with boys. \nIncreased collective actions were observed at the community level through theatre, sports, arts by girls, \nboys, parents and survivors of trafficking to challenge harmful practices. 227 community based social  \nactions were organised by CYiM on gender based harmful practices and stigma associated with trafficking. \n3,032 influential leaders and communicators participated in social action events, among them 398 \ninfluential leaders and communicators made public declarations against gender based harmful practices and \nhave shown support to survivors. \n669 community male members are able to recognise negative gender norms behind revictimization of \nsurvivors and harmful practices; like forced marriage and 564 male family members showed support to \n \n \ngirls by preventing early marriage and byapproaching survivors and encouraging them to live a stigma \nfree life. \n \n \n7.3.c. Objective 3: Shortfalls \nDevelopment of  Social Behaviour Change guideline based on global guidelines with techniques and tips \nfollowed is ongoing in collaboration with WINDCHANGERS, after the completion of the same, partners \nwill be provided training on how to use the materials. Contextualisation of the stories based on the feedback \nfrom the partners and children has taken longer than anticipated, however we strongly feel that this process \nis critical, and therefore have not taken shortcuts to speed the process up. \nThe understanding on gender and sexuality is varied among the project partner organisations, where a was \nobserved among the frontline workers when they initiated discussions on gender and sexuality. For many, \nthey felt comfortable to talk about sexuality, menstrual health, safe and unsafe touch. \nIn conducting reflection sessions with boys, the partner organisations shared a challenge relating to the drop \nout. This drop out rates of boys are much higher among the boys in the age group 15 -18 years and above \nupto 24 years since the boys are mostly migrating out from the villages with their  families for seasonal \nworks. \nIn conducting reflection sessions with the girls also related to drop out, Girls who are in the age group 18- \n24 years are getting married or migrating with families for work, or going out for educational purpose since \nthere is no proper infrastructure for higher studies in most of the intervention areas. \nOne of the challenge faced by the partners at field level is getting in touch with the male members and \nbringing all the male members in one place to initiate discussions. The male members are the main \nbreadwinners of the family and most of them migrate out of the village in search of work and are therefor \nunavailable. \n \n \n \n8.", "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project?": "What has your team learned during the implementation and evaluation of your project? \nRecommendations that came out of the endline (phase 2 of the Oak grant) and baseline study for this \ncurrent phase 3", "Grant period": "grant period: \nThe baseline study carried out during the initial phase of Year-1, OAK Phase 3 was helpful to understand \nthe current status of implementation. Some of the major findings were: \n\u2022 Need for strengthening of inter-agency resource pools at the district level for addressing immediate \nneeds of the survivors like food, nutrition, health and livelihood support. \n\u2022 Providing handholding support to the partner organisations since the understanding. \n\u2022 District level child protection institutions and service providers have not been adequately engaged \nwith to influence institutional processes and practices through tools, the need of training on psycho-\nsocial support, safeguarding, gender and harmful social norms, and their for have been identified \nto be incorporated in the new/current 3rd grant phase. \n\u2022 The advocacy initiatives towards sustainable reintegration must have a focus on ensu ring market \noriented livelihood options to women towards empowering them as well as augmenting their family \nincome, \n\u2022 Prevention of trafficking to be advocated at all levels of the government, \n \n \n\u2022 Engaging with relevant agencies of the state to adequately addres s the rehabilitation and \nreintegration needs of survivors, \n\u2022 Devise suitable ways of leveraging the learnings to inspire similar initiatives in the sector, as well \nas create models to demonstrate the results by strengthening organizations with certain strengths to \nsupport strategic growth, \n\u2022 Deconstruct non-negotiable features of a \u2018functional\u2019 community level safety net with a focus on \nsustainability, \n\u2022 Ensuring more participation of men seems crucial as typically men are the decision makers within \nfamily, \n\u2022 The need of registration system at panchayat level for tracking and monitoring of influencing gram \npanchayats to prioritize vulnerable families under the list of potential beneficiaries of different \nwelfare and poverty reduction programmes, \n\u2022 C suitable pedagogy to conduct discussions on the issues of gender and sexuality as well as \nengaging with community beliefs towards addressing stereotypes, \n\u2022 Ensuring space for survivors to engage in dialogue, create online training programmes; particularly \nfor service providers associated with district level child protection institutions, \n\u2022 Strengthen inter -agency collaboration in order to envisage new avenues of skill building and \nlivelihood opportunities for women, beyond gender stereotypes and primary sector, \n\u2022 Sensitization of district level child protection functionaries on standard child reintegration \npractices, \n\u2022 Currently, child safeguarding/ protection policy of most organizations doesn\u2019t seem to suggest \nsuitable ways to \u2018respond\u2019 to the harms that have happened beyond reporting or identify measures \nto address the immediate needs of the victim, and pandemic induced vulnerabilities needs to be \ntaken into account \n  \nIncorporating M&E as a critical domain within the project based on the recommendation from the \nbaseline.which we believe will add significant value to the project. An online workshop was organized for \nall the partner organisations, which was conducted by the M&E officer of Tdh Foundation where \ndiscussions were carried outon the project follow up tools, which the partne rs are using for reflecting the \nplan and result of implementation on a monthly basis. The workshop has been very beneficial for the partner \norganisations to develop an understanding on how to establish links between the activities planned and the \nresults being achieved with the CYiM, and how to maintain the supporting documents. A resource document \nwas prepared for the partners to follow, which was shared with them for streamlining the process of updating \nof project follow up tool. \nBased on the above mentio ned recommendations of the baseline study,  within this reporting period \n5 decentralised resource pools  were formed in Jharkhand and 3 in West  Bengal to provide assistance to \nvictims of unsafe migration   at the district level for addressing immediate needs of the survivors such as \nfood, nutrition, health and livelihood support. \nThe Formation of a project steering \u201cCore Group\u201d has been an important milestone for the Project. Given \nthe large network of partner NGOs in the Project, the Core Group comprised of 6 NGOs in Jharkhand and \n7 NGOs in West Bengal along with Tdh, to ensure the smooth functioning of the Project towards its \nsuccessful conclusion. The Core Group  has been supporting Tdh to provide strategic direction of the \nproject, determine a plan of actions for certain initiatives. The Core Group has been formed with suggestions \nfrom all the partner organizations and has a specific Terms of Reference. The membership in the core group \nis revolving, with a new group formed every year to allow new organisatio ns to join the group. The core \ncommittee members have added values during the review meetings and have worked on development of \n \n \nsafeguarding and MHPSS checklist which will be commonly followed by all the organisations in measuring \nthe changes at the ground level. \nAll organisations are not of equal strengths and capacity and some of them find difficulties in \ninstitutionalizing the learnings from the different trainings and workshops in their regular activities. Case \nmanagement has been found to be a challeng e with several social workers expressing the need for more \nhand holding support. On-site technical support can be provided to social workers to enable them to develop \nskills for more effective case management. Hence several capacity building workshops were organized for \nthe frontline workers in this reporting period. \nAs a result, 14 organisations were identified (7 from West Bengal and 7 from Jharkhand) among the 30 \npartner organisations as piloting partners (partners who will pilot the negative gender norm  change \nintervention to reduce stigma and violence against the survivors which falls under outcome 3). The selection \nof these 14 piloting  partners was based on capacities of the organisations and was done in a consultative \nand transparent way. The remainin g partner organisations are identified as the non -piloting partner \norganisations and are working only under outcome 1 and 2.   \n  \nThe delays and restrictions as a result of COVID-19 helped the team to learn how to be agile by changing \noperational practices, ways of communication and work. In adapting to the changing context and ways of \nworking, the project team digitalised the trainings and learningsto provide blended victim support services. \nDuring the monitoring visits, from the field anecdotes were collec ted from the CYP and Stakeholders to \ndocument changes taking place as a result of the intervention. Some of the anecdotes are mentioned below- \n\u201cI am Ayesha, I am a youth leader of Sabuj Sathi group. I have received many training as a youth leader. I \nhave received mental support, educational support like books, tuition fees etc. from GGBK. In this year, I \nhave passed my secondary examination. I am very happy to be a part of this youth leadership programme.\u201d \n\u201cWe children of Baridih, Bero Block,Ranchi found this process of Kabaddi very helpful during this period \nof lockdown. We never had such opportunity to think about our mental wellbeing through games and \nother activities.\u201d \n\u201c During this lockdown we were closed at home and we were totally cut off from the peer groups but this \nprocess gives us opportunity to sit together and discuss on the child protection issues.\u201d \n\u201cWe learnt how to sit together and help each other and express our views after this important intervention \nin our village and learnt about gender  and other child protection concerns and how the harmful social \nnorms are so deeply rooted within our thought process.\u201d \n\u201cThere is a playground in my village in which only boys used to play. There was no place for girls to play \nwith other girls. Once the boy and the girl were given training on gender and leadership by the NGO didi , \nit could change the mindset and awareness of both the boys and the girls.As a result both the teams have \nagreed  to play on the same field. Now both boys & girls are enjoying Kab addi / Badminton or football \ngame together along with their peers in the same field.\u201d \n\u201cThrough mapping process of YouCreate I have explored the resources of my village and also identified \nproblems which has helped me to understand a picture of my area where I stay. I am a Children and Youth \nin Migration (CYiM) leader, I have learnt leadership and I know how to manage problems of my own life \nand my peer group members.\u201d-Statements from the CYP\u2019 s \n\u201cI am a local language teacher in a government school. I am fami liar with the school's teaching and \nlearning rules, but child protection was a new word for me. I didn\u2019t had adequate information about what \nis trafficking, child safeguarding, child marriage and CHILDLINE, although the child rights had been \nheard. There have been a series of meetings and trainings for  Children and Youth in Migration (CYiM) \nconducted at the school, in which I have also had the opportunity to attend many times. This made us \nknowledgeable. In view of their needs, especially for the safe place of the girl child, a room has been allotted \nto Children and Youth in Migration (CYiM) group in the school where they perform meetings and other \nactivities as a group.\u201d \n \n \n\u201cFrom the COVID pandemic period, I have seen that children have stopped studying and co ntinuously \nplaying or going to forest for collecting woods as  a source of income. So, after the schools have started \nafter lockdown, only 50% children have started going to school. Now, I along with the village level \nvolunteers have started tracking the children who are out of school to bring them back and readmitted them \nin school. Because according to me, if children can be bought back to the mainstream of education then all \nproblems of child marriage, child trafficking and child labour will be less in numbers, as children will find \nan objective in their life to go ahead in future.\u201d \n-Statements from the stakeholders and influential leaders \n\u201cI never used to take part in household work but now I help my wife. I also used to discriminate between \nmale and female children, but my outlook has been changed.\u201d \n\u201cI have understood the issues of Toxic Masculinity and have changed myself after attending the \nmeetings.\u201d \n\u201cNow I protest whenever I observe any violence against women and I also invite other to protest. \u201c \n\u201cNow I can understand and identify the gender discrimination's existing in our society, and trying to \nchange myself.\u201d \n-Statements from the male members \n \n \n9.", "How will your team use this information to change the way you work?": "How will your team use this information to change the way you work? \nBased on the learnings of Year 1 of OAK Phase-3, in Year 2 the plan is as followed: \n1. Partner organisations have been provided with handholding support on BECOME Tool, MHPSS, \nGender and Sexuality, Safeguarding etc. since the understanding of the tools and other relevant \ntopics under this intervention required more support. \n2. 1 state level consultation in West Bengal, 103 multi-sectorial coordination meetings and 76 liasons \nhave been done with various formal and informal child protection duty bearers to make the \ncommunity level safety net functional with a focus on sustainability, advocating on prevention of \ntrafficking at all levels of government and engaging with relevant agencies of the state to address \nthe rehabilitation and reintegration needs of the survivors. \n3. Considering the power dynamics, participation of men seems crucial as typically men are the \ndecision makers within the family, hence in Year 1, 669 male members can recognise negative \ngender norms behind revictimization of survivors and harmful practices; like forced marriage and \n564 male family members show support to girls by preventing early marriage and to survivors by \nencouraging them to live a stigma free life. \n4. Through development of the module on gender and sexuality, training sessions were organized with \nthe frontline wo rkers on Gender and Sexuality, and the project engaged  with 3032 influential \nleaders and communicators in various social events to conduct discussions on the issues of gender \nand sexuality as well as engaging with community beliefs towards addressing stereotypes. \n5. Community safe spaces have been created in all the 70 locations to ensure safe spaces for the CYP \nto engage in dialogue. \n6. Online training programmes are created on Child Protection, Gender and Sexuality, MHPSS, \nSafeguarding for the service providers associated with district level child protection institutions. \n7. The inter-agency collaborations were strengthened to envisage new avenues of skill building and \nlivelihood opportunities for women through linkage with varios government schemes, scholarships \nand vocational trainings. \n \n \n8. Training has been provided to the organisation level and field level focal points on the 5 modules \nof safeguarding  to ensure that the organizations ensure suitable ways to \u2018respond\u2019 to the harms that \nhave happened beyond reporting or identify measures to address the immediate needs of the victim. \n9. Pandemic induced victims were taken into considerations where the children who have lost one or \nboth parents during the pandemic were linked with various schemes of the gover nment like \nsponsorship scheme, and the education system through admission in Kasturba Gandi Vidyalayas, \nand dry ration support through linkage with CHILDLINE etc. \nThrough the   following initiatives based on the feedback received from children during the ba seline \nevaluatuion, the voices of the children raised have been considered at all levels of intervention. \nIn Year 2, the aim is to achieve results that could not be achieved in Year 1, and to respond to the \nrecommendations from the evaluation, such as implementation of the child protection policy of Ministry of \nWomen and Child development in every school in the intervention areas, leveraging learnings to inspire \nsimilar initiatives in the sector, create models to demonstrate results by strengthening organiz ations with \ncertain strengths in the strategic direction, leveraging organization\u2019s capacity on psychosocial interventions, \nregistration system at Panchayat level for tracking and monitoring, Influencing Gram Panchayats to \nprioritize vulnerable families un der the list of potential beneficiaries of different welfare and poverty \nreduction programmes and engaging with relevant agencies of the state to adequately address the \nrehabilitation and reintegration needs of survivors. Based on this, the following actibivities for the 2nd year \nare planned: \n1. Capacity building support to  grass root level workers who are continuously engaging in all the \nactivities at field level. The capacity building workshops have been planned to be done primarily \non Gender and Sexuality and MHPSS through face to face discussions and activity oriented sessions \nwhich the frontline workers can use during field level implementation. \n2. Based on feedbacks received from the frontline workers during the review meetings and partners \nmeet, handholding support in Empowerplus upgraded version and the Livelihood Preconditioning \nTool will be provided.   \n3. Training of Trainers (TOT) on Problem Management Plus (PM+) a WHO transdiagnostic \npsychological intervention for common mental health problems for the fro nt line workers for \npsychological intervention program, that can be delivered by non-specialist counsellors. \n4. The Core Committee Group which has been formed in West Bengal and Jharkhand will be \nrestructured again since the group is of revolving nature to fo ster the principles of partnership, \nparticipation and collaboration in the project more effectively. \n5. The Technical Advisory Group (TAG) will be revived in West Bengal and Jharkhand in Year-2 The \nmembers of the TAG will support in providing technical inputs for revising the tools, align the tools \ndeveloped with Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015 and will provide support in \nstrategic advocacy with government. \n6. E-learning materials will be developed on the 5 basic child protection laws of India in  local \nlanguages (Hindi and Bengali) which will promote understanding among the frontline workers on \nthe legal framework. \n7. The plan in Year 2 is to conduct a series of state and district level consultations in West Bengal and \nJharkhand on Gender Responsive Prevention and Response to Child Protection with Child \nProtection Duty Bearers and with Media on Ethical Reporting to focus more on the engagements \nwith government bodies and media and boost up the advocacy initiatives. \n8. Tdh staffs will be more available to the partners (specially Jharkhand) to support Gender and Norm \nintervention, MHPSS Intervention through sports and art methodologies due to the low  level of \nunderstanding among partners. \n9. Tdh will create more space for knowledge and information sharing among the partners as exchange \nof ideas, actions and good practices play an important role in design and plan for advocacy.  \n \n \nLongitudinal study will be conducted to understand \u201cdiffusion in social norms change around gender \namong adolescent and young people and its outcome on stigma against the survivors of exploitation, their \nsocial cohesion and psychosocial resilience. The objective of the longitudinal study is to understand how \nstructured CYiM led social behaviour change communication interventions contribute to organised \ndiffusion in social norms change and supporting social cohesion, psychosocial resilience and then \neffectively reduced stigma against survivors of exploitation. This study will further help us to understand \nthe conditions that help or hinder changes in gender norms. \n \n \n10.", "How will you share what you have learned inside and outside your organisation?": "How will you share what you have learned inside and outside your organisation? \nThe learning that is being generated within the Project have been disseminated in various ways. \n\u2022 Tdh\u2019s Social Media Platform: Good practices and learnings are shared through Tdh\u2019s Facebook, \nInstagram and LinkdIn page with readers, like minded organisations, academics, mental health \npractitioners and members. \n\u2022 Partners meet: Project updates, good practices and experiences are shared thr ough the partners \nmeet.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nProgress Report for the period of 1/07/2021 to 31/10/22 \n  \n  \nDuring Second wave of Covid-19, we started working in the field to form community groups. As \nmany issues were discussed during Micro level planning, the groups started forming based on \nvarious issues associated with different communities like farmers groups for agriculture related \nissues, women groups for livelihood related issues, adolescent groups for child marriage or \nmigration related issues. Through general issue discussion and introducing the objective of this \nproject, several women and adolescents girls related issues like negligence to menstruation health, \nearly child marriage, school drop out, early pregnancy, random child birth at home, gender based \nviolence(especially domestic violence)  etc. Considering these issues a few mixed adult women and \nadolescent groups were formed and Mukti field ACV staff started organizing several workshops on \ngender discriminations with the help of various participatory tools supported by Rupantaran and \nPrajaak. 8 Adolescent girls boys and 5 women groups( total 320 groups members) got support to \nbuild their perspective on gender related issues and gradually started identifying gender \ndiscrimination in their personal life. The basic sensitization workshops also conducted among adult \nmen groups. As a result, women started taking active role in the collective discussions making \nprocess and the woman man ratio in every meetings are nearly became 1:1 as other men are also \nstarted taking positive initiative to create a safe and non judging space for women. Adolescent \ngroups have also started identifying their issues and through root cause analysis, they are getting \na clear understanding on gender discrimination and how it impacts their lives( issues came during \ndiscussion like - restriction in higher education for girls, mobility restrictions, gender role etc)  \nAs an outcome, Heramba Gopalpur women group joined in a community led event organized on \n15th Aug 2022. For Heramba Gopalpur women group, it was the first time for them when they \nparticipated in a rally and slogan writing. In the main part of the program they also gave a speech \non Independence day.  \n \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \n  \nDuring the community groups formation, we initially faced a huge political challenges as most of \nthe group members were belong to  different vulnerable groups, the ruling party members started \ngiving objections to conduct any meetings regarding their issues. For these political pressure, a \nlarge number of members started dropping out from the groups and refuse to take part into any \ndiscussions. At that time, the whole ACV working team started approaching to the panchayat \nmembers to join the meetings to understand the objective of this project. But due to the presence of \nthe Panchayat members, some kind of pseudo domination in each discussion started taking places \nand these discussions spaces turned into a space for ruling and opponent party members and the \nreal issues left undiscussed. In such situations a few perspective building workshops conducted by \nthe facilitation of  ACV team among all the groups to develop the capacity of the community \nmembers as well as the Panchayat members to understand the concept of right based and \ncommunity led approach and to develop the relationship between community members , ACV team \nmembers and Panchayat or other powerful stakeholders( teachers, doctors, health workers). With \nseveral set of meeting and discussion or activities ( perspective building support and \nmodule provided  by Praxis, Rupantaran, DRCSC, NCAS and Prajaak) , the groups became stable \nand the power influence tends to decrease over time.    \nIn the beginning of 2nd year ( 1/07/2021),  new field staff and program coordinator were recruited \nwho were not completely aligned with the project goal. Hence, it became a bit challenging to the \nACV staff to be the facilitators and as a result, most of the proposed solutions started \nbecome partially influenced by the project staff itself such as the decisions taken by collective \ndiscussion on training topics, scheduling the meetings, issue identification etc. This challenge \ngradually solved with the continue handholding support of other ACV resource partners and \ninternal staff meeting and orientation program.            \n           \n \n \n \n7.2.a.

The issues mostly addressed by the women groups are - 1. \nLimited scope for sharing personal opinion in the group meetings,2.Lack of confidence to talk \nabout the violation of their basic rights(mobility, earning options, decision making, domestic \nviolence, health related issues). The sensitization program performed by Mukti ACV field staff \nhelped those women to understand the reason of these issues through but it takes a lot more time to \ndevelop their confidence to talk about those issues freely in front of other community members. In \norder to achieve the safe environment for all the women members from different \ncommunities(Farmers, daily labour, Migrant workers etc) many orientation program conducted and \nas a result, women started taking initiatives to raise voice against discrimination. Initiative taken \nby the Women collective - 1. Rally to raise awareness on gender based discrimination, slogan \nwriting 2. Motivational speech on woman's empowerment by women members, 3. Awareness \nprogram on Menstruation Health, 4. Developing business and marketing idea for sanitary pad \nproduction 5. Started taking action on community led advocacy to avail free ambulance \nservice(which was provided earlier and recently has been stopped by the local Govt) for the \npregnant women.  \nInitiative taken by the Adolescents groups -  1.Both boys and girls equally participated in rally to \nraise awareness on  menstruation health related taboo and developing a street play group to raise \nawareness on early child marriage and Child labour (Adolescent boys are forced to start working to \nsupport their family from early ages and this situation increases the possibility of unsafe migration) \n. 2. Active role has been taken by the adolescent groups in community led advocacy on river \nembankment related issues to collect the required evidence.3. Adolescent groups are also \nplanning to take initiative to reduce the negative impact of unnecessary usage of social media and \nextreme addiction of online gaming in the youth community.       \n \n \n \n7.2.c.

During the 15th Aug program planning, all the woman's collective(5groups - 120 \nwomen) refused to participate actively in awareness program as they were concerned about the \ncomments they might have received for stepping out from their home to participate in  such \ncommunity events and as a result they ended up suggesting the Adolescent groups(8 groups - 100 \nboys and 120 girls) to attend this event to fulfill the purpose. To overcome such challenges, we \nrequested these women groups to arrange a few meetings to talk about this issue. To resolve \nthis,  Mukti ACV team facilitated the risk assessment process and orientation programs to develop a \nclear perspective about the consequences of their initiative and who and how the others will be \nimpacted through these. With several approach, a few women from each groups convinced to take \nlead to mobilize other women and they successfully completed the event.  \nIn community led advocacy group which is working on river embankment issue, several challenges \nwere experienced by the vulnerable community representatives during the larger village level \ncommittee formation. As river embankment issue is one of the major issues in Heramba gopalpur \narea which is untreated by local Govt for past few years, people from most effected \ncommunities refused to talk about their issues to find a possible solution through collective \ndiscussion as they were more concern about their approach might get wrong and they will become \nmore vulnerable. Hence a conflict created in this village level committee and they started deforming \nit. To resolve such issues, the objective of community led advocacy again properly defined among \nthese committee members by the ACV facilitators and by the support of NCAS member, the \ncommittee started becoming united     \n \n \n \n7.3.a.

The process started with several focus group discussion to understand the  current \nlivelihood status of several communities  and the challenges they are facing right now. \nThrough  multiple meetings,  women groups turned into the most vulnerable groups as they all are \ndirectly or indirectly involve in several livelihoods(especially farming, fishing) but don't have \nminimum agency over the earnings and the second most vulnerable community in Heramba \nGopalpur area is the farmers community. Earning through farming became one of the unstable \noptions as in past 4 years, people of Heramba Gopalpur experienced four disasters(Amphan, \nPhaani, Bulbul and Yaash) which created flooding situations in their area. This situation mostly \nforced the farmers community (specially male farmers with limited land) to become \nseasonal migrant workers to run their families. On other hand, the degree of vulnerability of this \nfarmers community is also high due to the lack of knowledge about cropping as most of the lands \nare only used for monocropping so the net worth of annual produce become low as respect to the \nneed of a farmer's family. This situation also leads most of the farmers to become a migrant \nworkers for most of the period of time in a year. In such situation, to revive the soil condition, \norganic farming training has been provided to almost 300 farmers where around 30% farmers \n(including women and men) started making organic fertilizer and pesticides to reduce farming \nexpenses.   \nAnd among the women and mixed groups, these groups started exploring suitable options according \nto their resource and abilities. Through several participatory approach, few livelihood options came \nup from these groups such as chicken rearing (especially native breed) indigenous seed collection \nand selling, crab culture , sanitary pad production, paper plate making, scented stick and candle \nmaking etc. Along with skill development training, several orientation program and marketing skill \ndevelopment process also going on among these groups. The training needs came up through local \ndemand and supply chain analysis. Presently farmers groups(Women and men) and other interested \nmembers from different communities received chicken rearing training and started chicken farming \nin a small scale.    \n \n \n \n7.3.c. Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n \nOak Progress Report.    7 \n  \nThe concept of having an additional livelihood option in their own locality is largely ignored in \nvarious communities in Sundarbans. As farming is the primary livelihood for ~85% of population \nin Heramba Gopalpur GP and most of the lands are used for mono cropping, for the additional \nincome purpose, most of the people (especially male members of the family) became engage in \nseasonal fishing or became migrant worker for a long period of time in the year. These issues were \nobserved during the FGD with the farmers, fisherman and daily labour groups. Through meetings \nand  discussion, as different additional livelihood options were introduced to these groups, mostly \nmale members were refused to take interest for further discussion or initiatives. In such situation, \nthe additional livelihood implementation initiative started with the women groups who are involved \nwith different livelihood ( farming, daily labour, fishing). Through new FGH(Focus Group \nDiscussion) , several needs emerged but also a clear demand came from the communities regarding \nfinancial and marketing support for any production related business ideas such as Pickle, Scented \nSticks, Soft toys etc. Then the ACV team started taking different approach to build capacity of the \ncommunities to understand the local market demands and supply chain for developing own ideas \naccording to the needs of the local market. To develop such capacity, several tools were given to \nhelp them understand the current market demands. Parallelly, a few orientation programs were \nconducted to help them understand their role to sustain their livelihood.  These all initiatives are \ngradually helping to eliminate the concept of dependency to third parties for raw material \ncollection, product manufacturing and marketing.   \nPresently , the woman groups mapped and analyzed the basic local market demands and according \nto that, they have selected two livelihood options - 1. Sanitary pad manufacturing and marketing 2. \nChicken rearing(native breed). Hence to establish their business, the woman groups are making \nstrategies to overcome these challenges.  \n \n \n8.", "Significant changes": "Significant changes.

This scenario started changing gradually when we(the facilitators) become more \nequipped through participating in several capacity building workshops and we started \nunderstanding our role even better to ensure maximum active participation of all members in each \ngroup. This practice helped us create a safe space for women and adolescents. As a clear indication, \na woman from the minority community shared her experience for being humiliated by all the \nneighbors including the panchayat members  due to her daughter refused to accept her abusive \nhusband and chose to marry for second time. During the meeting, she shared this incident in front \nof all other group members and especially to the panchayat member who was present in \nthis meeting to explain how this discriminatory behavior impacted their lives. \n2. Through Participatory Action Research process, the community groups started taking initiatives \nin order to identify issues , analyse the issues, evidence collection, stakeholders mapping and \nstrategy planning through adopting various  participatory approach. Through PAR, most \nof initiatives gradually turn into community-led with the minimal support of ACV facilitators.  \n3. The ACV Mukti project staff became more sensitive in respect to various sense. Before receiving \nany capacity building training, the facilitators were completely unaware of participatory approach. \nHence in the initial meetings, the facilitators dominated the entire meeting. But over the period of \ntime, as we were introduced to participatory approach through training and workshop, our approach \nto community members changed completely. From selecting the meeting dates, making the meeting \nagenda, any activity related planning to implementation - all are being conducted through \nparticipatory approach facilitated by the ACV field staff.                 \n \n \n9.

The discussions set \nthe foundation for subsequent rounds that will build their skills to communicate these issues \nwith adults and partners. \n\u2022 Promoted our AI-powered chatbot (Disha Didi) and conducted SRH sessions in schools \nreaching 1,800 girls. \nYoung men \n\u2022 Conducted sessions with men on relevant SRH information, particularly contraception, and \nemphasized their role in supporting women's SRH. \n\u2022 Used an interactive game to emphasize the connection between reproductive health and \nfinances. This encouraged discussions on the importance of family planning giving segway \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \nto deeper discussions \u2013 including adopting safe sexual practices and using contraception \nthemselves for the benefits it brings to their relationships and families. \nAlso conducted couple counselling with non-users of contraceptive \u2013 youth leaders reported \nthat 2,100 of 2,700 couples have adopted a modern contraceptive (self-reported), with nearly \n55% using condom. \n3. Sensitized 1,840 family members on supporting young women\u2019s SRH \nSensitized mothers and mothers-in-law on SRH-related barriers that came up during discussions \nwith young women. While a lot of these emanated from long-held beliefs and traditionally \nfollowed practices, they also include common misconceptions that hinder adoption of healthy \nSRH practices by young women \u2013 youth leaders addressed these during their sessions. \n4. Strengthened two public health facilities to offer youth friendly SRH services \nOriented all relevant staff in intervention facilities (four CAC providers and two counsellors) on \nprovisions of the MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021 and provision of youth-responsive SRH \nservices, including abortions to young women. \n5. Strengthened six HWCs to offer SRH services and referral \n\u2022 Based on district officials\u2019 request, conducted district-level contraceptive training for 10 \ncommunity health officers (CHOs) to expand their role in contraceptive service provision \u2013 \nthe training was attended by the civil surgeon and other officials, who appreciated the \ntraining. \n\u2022 Conducted virtual orientation for 20 CHOs and a telemedicine hub doctor for initiating \nprovision of injectable contraceptive through eSanjeevani (federal government\u2019s \ntelemedicine program). \n\u2022 Conducted facility strengthening, including provision of equipment, facilitating IEC \nmaterials, strengthening documentation, and introduction to the referral mechanism. \n\u2022 Strengthened six sub centres in the catchment area as referral points \u2013 we oriented relevant \nstaff on SRH and referral mechanism and facilitated display of IEC material. \n      Our complementary efforts at the community and facility levels facilitated provision of SRH \nservices to 14,375 young women. Please refer Annexure 1 for break-up by age group and type of \nservice provided. \n6.

Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nKey learnings and insights: \n\u2022 Communication strategy \u2013 Developed in collaboration with a social and behavior change \ncommunication consultant, the revised communication strategy emphasizes on key \nprinciples \u2013 rights, power, space, participation and inclusion \u2013 and works to address key \nfactors that influence behavior, including social norms, beliefs and values. The youth \nleaders are on a learning curve implementing these newer concepts in the community, and \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \nwe are continuously adapting and refining the strategy (including combining modules) \nbased on their experience and learnings. \n\u2022 Working with the SRH framework \u2013 The revised strategy meant a major shift in the \ncommunity engagement approach of youth leaders, with focus on understanding the target \naudience's attitudes, beliefs, and motivators, and working on changing SRH-related \nbehaviors keeping these in mind. This approach brought forth unanticipated responses from \nthe communities, including seeking solutions for structural barriers (such as movement \nrestrictions) and other allied issues (like child marriage). This in turn has meant more \nintense mentorship by IDF to equip youth leaders to manage such conversations. Keeping \nthis in view, we have planned periodic capacity building of youth leaders to enable them to \neffectively moderate such conversations and offer support/referrals. \n\u2022 Prevailing attitudinal barriers among providers \u2013 We introduced a tool \u2013 an adaptation of \nIpas\u2019s Stigmatizing Attitudes, Beliefs and Actions Scale (SABAS) \u2013 to measure health \nstaffs\u2019 attitudes, perceptions and stigma related to abortion and contraception. The tool \ncomprises of 25 statements that the respondent rates on a Likert scale which is used to \nmeasure three important dimensions, negative stereotyping, exclusion and discrimination, \nand fear of contagion from those who associate with abortion and contraception. The tool \nhelped us discover prevailing negative beliefs and attitudes that hinder service provision \u2013 \nsuch as women who use birth spacing may become promiscuous or having an abortion may \nbecome a habit for women \u2013 that we will work on addressing. \n\u2022 Safe spaces \u2013 Youth leaders created six safe spaces in anganwadi centres and schools to \nprovide young girls an environment where they could have confidential and non-judgmental \nconversations about SRH; these were visited by over 560 young women and girls. While we \nreceived a positive response, we recognized the limitation of this approach with dependence \non youth leaders and the spaces themselves not being accessible by young girls \nindependently. We are re-visiting this and will test an approach where the safe space \nfacilitates unrestricted access \u2013 for example, creating online forums to facilitate these \nconversations, encouraging leadership by the yuva saathis who can work with their peers to \nidentify other such spaces and facilitate these conversations. \n \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective \nStrengthen an enabling environment supportive for adolescent girls and young women (ages 10-\n24 years) to meet their SRH needs in four existing intervention areas of Magrahat 1, Mathurapur \n1, Mathurapur 2, Kulpi in West Bengal \n \n \n \n7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nUsing the revamped strategy (similar to objective 1), we focused on nurturing a supportive \nenvironment for young women and adolescent girls. Our youth leaders reached adolescents and \nyoung women with rights-based SRH information through community and school sessions, \nnurtured support of community gatekeepers, and worked on normalizing SRH conversations at the \n \nOak Progress Report.    5 \ncommunity and family levels. Complementing this, we decentralized SRH services to lower-level \nfacilities and initiated capacity building of community-based young volunteers, yuva saathis. \nSummary of progress on project outcomes: \n1. Oriented 3,620 adolescents (10-19 years) and 1,260 young women on life skills, rights, \nand gender \nAdolescents \n\u2022 Youth leaders provided age-appropriate SRH information, especially the negative impact of \nearly marriage and pregnancy on their health and lives. \n\u2022 Along with foundational conversations on rights, emphasized on positive body image and \nself-esteem, respecting personal boundaries and the importance of open communication \nwith parents, peers, and healthcare providers on SRH issues. \n\u2022 Adolescents are more comfortable talking about SRH \u2013 they are vocal about their concerns \nduring sessions with youth leaders and are active during community events (like world \npopulation day) doing rallies, role plays, discussions on SRH etc that indicates this groups\u2019 \nimproved confidence and engagement with SRH issues. \nYoung women \n\u2022 Introduced them to the rights-based framework, with emphasis on delivering SRH \ninformation in a manner that is more relatable and resonates with them to facilitate behavior \nchange. \n\u2022 Through case studies and role plays, fostered understanding of the practical aspects of \ncontraception, and decision making processes involved in choosing and using contraception. \nWe learnt of a young woman who reported how the role play during the youth leader\u2019s \nsession gave her ideas on having a conversation with her mother-in-law that helped initiate \ncontraceptive use. \n       Please click the link Khadija's diary by ipasdevelopmentfoundation - Issuu for a representative \ncase. \n2. Sensitized 1,300 family members to play a supportive role \nSensitized mothers and mothers-in-law on SRH, especially addressing misconceptions \nhighlighted by young women, ranging from contraception being unnatural and causing weight \ngain or use of contraception impacting women\u2019s fertility. We also facilitated joint meetings with \ntheir daughters-in-law emphasizing the adverse consequences of teenage pregnancy and unsafe \nabortions, and encouraging them to support young girls for SRH-related care. \n3. Sensitized 25 PRI members and 25 SHG members on SRH \nTo garner support for young women\u2019s SRH, youth leaders oriented key community gatekeepers \non our intervention and the importance of SRH for young women. They have been helpful in \naddressing on-ground issues during community events and have supported youth leaders in \ninfluencing family members. \n4. Strengthened four public health facilities and associated Anwesha clinics for SRH \n\u2022 Oriented four providers and three Anwesha counsellors in the intervention facilities on the \namended abortion law, including providing a handout for reference. \n\u2022 Streamlined supply of injectable contraceptives by liasoning with the state FP nodal officer. \n\u2022 The period witnessed irregular services by counselors due to long leave or charge of \nadditional facilities. In such situations, counsellors relied on IDF youth leaders for reaching \nadolescents with SRH information and referring them to service providers. \n \nOak Progress Report.    6 \n\u2022 Identified some misconceptions using the SABAS tool such as IUCD can cause cancer, and \nbiases among providers against women who have an abortion. \n5. Strengthened eight HWCs to offer adolescent/youth-friendly SRH services/referrals. \n\u2022 Initiated and streamlined contraceptive provision through eSanjeevani by training on \ncontraceptives (focus on long-acting reversible contraceptives) for 8 ANMs and 8 CHOs \nand a telemedicine hub doctor[1]. \n\u2022 Strengthened four sub centres in the catchment area as referral points by orienting relevant \nstaff on SRH and referral linkages. \nWe facilitated provision of SRH services to over 53,000 young women, including 16,116 \nadolescent girls. Please refer Annexure 1 for details. \n6. Developed a robust evaluation plan with comprehensive exit indicators with \ncomprehensive additional exit indicators. Please refer Annexure 2 for details. \nIn addition, as part of our efforts to disseminate and implement amendments to the MTP Act & \nRules in the state, using alternate funds, we: \n\u2022 Conducted state-level dissemination of the MTP Act amendments with participation of \nsenior state officials, 49 district officials and 28 CAC master trainers. \n\u2022 Conducted district-level orientation of district and block medical health officers of Diamond \nHarbour district. \n\u2022 Facilitated constitution of Medical Board at Medical College & Hospital Diamond Harbour \nfor late-term abortions. \n[1] IDF led this initiative at the state level through alternate funding \n \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nKey learnings and shortcomings: \n\u2022 Yuva Saathis \u2013 Working with youth leaders, we identified 20 girls from the community to be \nyuva saathis to provide peer support, lead community-based efforts and be the social capital \nthat the project leaves behind (in addition to the youth leaders themselves). IDF led the \ninitial batch of training with support from selected youth leaders and conducted two rounds \nof training \u2013 a technical session on SRH, followed by skill building in areas such as \neffective communication, active listening, facilitation and group management and engaging \npeers to identify SRHR barriers. This experience has been both challenging yet rewarding \u2013 \nit required us to continuously tailor the training (considering their prior knowledge and \nexperience of SRH, cultural background etc) and be patient, creative and adaptive to varying \nrates of learning. However, the energy, enthusiasm to learn, and willingness of yuva saathis \nto work on the issue and support communities was incredibly fulfilling, and kept us \nmotivated. \n\u2022 We were unable to reach a strategic alignment with the organization for sustainable supply \nof low-priced sanitary napkins. \n \n \n \nOak Progress Report.    7 \n \n7.3.a. Objective 3 Objective \nAdapt and expand the adolescent and youth-focused SRH model in three blocks in Sunderbans, \nWest Bengal \n \n \n \n7.3.b. Objective 3 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nIn Year 1, we laid the foundation for our intervention by conducting a community survey and \nfacility-level assessment to identify gaps and better understand the needs of our target audience. We \nstrengthened the capacity of healthcare providers and community intermediaries to provide youth-\nresponsive services and streamlined SRH services, especially at health and wellness centers for \nimproved access. With this strong foundation and our outcome indicators in place, we are now \nprepared to focus our community-based efforts to improve SRH behaviors and practices. \n1. Selected intervention areas for community interventions: \nWorking in consultation with district and block health officials, we selected six gram \npanchayats covering 23 villages in the three intervention blocks for community outreach \nactivities prioritizing panchayats that were further from health facilities and had poor service \naccess. We also selected three facilities \u2013 RH Rudranagar, RH Dwariknagar and RH \nMadhabnagar \u2013 for facility-level interventions. \n2. Conducted community-based assessment: \nTo assess knowledge, behavior, practices and access barriers that young women and adolescents \nface, we conducted a cross-sectional community survey with 767 respondents (including \nadolescent girls, young women and men) in the three intervention blocks. Some key findings: \n\u2022 Young women and girls have high level of stigma, myths, and misconceptions related to \nSRH issues \u2013 most of them around menstruation (69%) and abortion (54%) \n\u2022 Agency is low \u2013 irrespective of marital status, young women and girls majorly rely on \nothers to take decisions on education, marriage, healthcare, and pregnancy. \n\u2022 They have poor negotiating ability \u2013 more than one fourth adolescents reported poor ability \nto negotiate with parents regarding continuing education or time of marriage. \n\u2022 About one third of male respondents reported having a positive outlook towards women\u2019s \nSRH. \n3. Developed outcome indicators: \nBased on the community assessment and our understanding of the current challenges, we \ndetermined outcome indicators and the expected level of change we anticipate by the project \nend. Please refer Annexure 2 for the indicator list. \n4. Strengthened three IDF intervention facilities and associated Anwesha clinics to offer \nadolescent/youth-friendly SRH services: \n\u2022 Facilitated CAC training for two doctors in RH Dwariknagar and one doctor in \nMadhabnagar. \n \nOak Progress Report.    8 \n\u2022 Conducted onsite orientations in two facilities, orienting 24 facility staff including doctors, \nnursing staff and counsellors, with a focus on adolescent and youth specific SRH and the \nimportant role each of them play in facilitating SRH access. \n\u2022 Introduced relevant staff to the referrals by community health intermediaries; provided \nleaflets in the Anwesha clinics for distribution and reference aids for counselors. \n5. Strengthened six HWCs to offer adolescent/youth-friendly SRH services and referrals: \na. Needs assessment: Conducted needs assessment in six HWCs, key observations: \n\u2022 Except one, all HWCs had a community health officer (CHO) in place \n\u2022 Facility staff reported/demonstrated gaps in technical knowledge on contraception, and had \nnot had any orientation on youth-friendly services \n\u2022 While most HWCs followed waste management protocol, there were major gaps in infection \nprevention, documentation and IEC on FP/adolescent health \n\u2022 Sub-optimal SRH service provision \nb. Capacity building: \n\u2022 Initiated injectable contraceptive (first dose) at five HWCs through eSanjeevani \n(telemedicine) \n\u2022 Conducted centralized training for ANMs from all six HWCs with sessions on modern \ncontraceptives, including model and hands-on practice on IUCD insertion; amendments to \nthe abortion law; adolescent SRH issues; and provision of youth-responsive services. The \nDeputy Chief Medical Officer Health attended the training and emphasized on teenage \npregnancy urging participants to focus on newly married young couples for delaying \npregnancy. \nc. Other support: Provided FP and SRH registers and oriented relevant staff on documentation; \nfacilitated display of IEC material on adolescent SRH and technical posters (such as \ninfection prevention) and provided reference aids for providers (including handout on \ncontraceptive methods and decision-making tool for contraception) \n6. Sensitized 169 community intermediaries to needs of adolescents and young women: \nSensitized community intermediaries through block-level orientations. The pre-test \nhighlighted attitudinal barriers \u2013 more than 80% believed that providing contraception and \nabortion information would mislead adolescents, that contraception should not be used before \nfirst pregnancy and that emergency contraceptive was for married women only. Over the next \nreporting period, as we initiate community outreach, we will focus efforts on addressing gaps \nin knowledge and garnering their support for adolescent SRH issues. \n \n \n \n7.3.c. Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nKey learnings and insights: \n\u2022 The project provided an improved understanding of the on-ground realities of the health \nsystem in the selected Sunderbans area. Service providers are non-committal and often tend \nto be non-supportive; there are huge gaps in technical knowledge and skills of facility staff; \nand documentation and recording is poor. The lack of effective monitoring due to the \n \nOak Progress Report.    9 \nremote location and the slow pace of work has resulted in interrupted service availability, \nwhich is further exacerbated for SRH services for young women. This provides us a huge \nopportunity to plug existing gaps and improve provision of regular SRH services for young \nwomen. \n\u2022 We identified prevailing contraception-related beliefs among health facility staff using the \nSABAS tool \u2013 newly married couples do not require contraception and prolonged use of \ncontraception can cause health hazards/make woman infertile.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nPraajak\u2019s work focuses on strengthening CBOs working in Sunderbans, to enable them integrate \nworking on gender & child protection issues within their existing works. \nOver the last year the CBOs have been have been equipped with the knowledge and perspectives to \nidentify and address issues of gender-based violence and violations of child rights within the \ncommunities they are working with through trainings. The CBOs have initiated outreach activities \nwithin women & children in the communities which is helping them understand the different \ngender & child protection issues in the communities that needs to be addressed. The CBOs, limited \nto working with men of the communities on livelihood issues are now expanding their works with \nwomen & children in the communities. Women, children & adolescents from the communities are \nalso coming out for the first time as they find a platform to speak about themselves, share their \nconcerns. \nIncidents of gender-based violence, violence against children are being reported with increased \ninteractions of CBOs with women & children. This generated a need within CBOs to equip \nthemselves to deal with such situations of violence and accordingly training plans were made with \nPraajak. Since dealing with cases require different systems and mechanisms to be in place, \ndiscussions on setting up organizational policies & systems were initiated. Thus, the management of \nthe organizations have been part of discussions and planning on the development of child protection \npolicies so as to ensure proper reporting mechanisms & handling of cases. \nThe outreach activities are leading to formation of women and adolescent groups and there is a \nmove towards collectivisation and working with the collectives, identifying leaders & developing \nleadership skills. \n  \n \n \n \n7.1.c.

The pandemic was yet another challenge as all the initiatives \nthat were undertaken had to be stalled and reworked upon in the last year. Praajak along with the \nCBOs were unable to meet the initial plans and there was almost a year\u2019s gap when the process \ncould be initiated. \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \nThe concepts of gender and child protection being new to the CBOs, it remained confined to the \nproject activities with limited engagement from the management to further the issue within the \norganizations.

But gradual \nprogression saw CBOs coming together for different trainings and orientation processes as there \nwere certain common needs emerging. \nBut the collaborative phase has just been initiated with joint training, orientations and the \nsubsequent discussions at formal and informal plains, where CBOs are discussing collaborations \nwith different stakeholders, collaborations among themselves for effective implementation of the \nprograms. CBOs are in the process of identifying stakeholders within the communities to work \nwith. Thus, there is a focus on understanding participation which would be the foundation of co-\noperation and collaboration between the CBOs and with the various stakeholders.   \nAccordingly various discussions on participatory approaches, methods of communication, needs of \ncollaboration are being organized with the CBOs.

Identification of stakeholders and ways of collaborations was initially \nchallenging as organizations are not adequately equipped with ways to ensure active participations \nof stakeholders, including women and children.

Objective 1 Objective \n\n \nOak Progress Report.    2 \nTo advocate for health system strengthening for improving access to rights-based SRH services \nincluding comprehensive abortion care in Kalchini and Kolkata districts.  \nFPA India has been providing SRH information and services in the aforementioned operational \nareas of Kalchini and Kolkata. Based on the steady increase in footfalls to the clinics of FPA \nIndia, or the number of beneficiaries reached through community-based interventions, there is a \nsustained need for SRH interventions. The public health infrastructure within the operational areas \nis also reliant upon the FPAI teams for last-mile service delivery (Kalchini), or to conduct male \nsterilization procedures (Kolkata). Ever since the onset of the pandemic, FPAI has received \nrequests to increase the range of services provided (especially in Kalchini) and expand services to \nnewer geographies (particularly in Kolkata). Through this objective, it is proposed to increase \nresource allocation, optimize the utilization of available resources and improve the capacities of \nhealth care providers for improving access.  \n  \n \n \n \n7.1.b. Objective 1 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nAn expansion of SRH Programme for Indigent Populations' Rights and Empowerment. \nThe Project ASPIRE supported by Oak Foundation is being implemented in West Bengal through \nFPA India\u2019s Kalchini and Kolkata Branches. It aims to expand access to sexual and reproductive \nhealth and empower individuals and communities to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights \nwith gender equality, economic empowerment and thus poverty alleviation. \nThe project has been implemented in West Bengal through FPA India\u2019s Kalchini branch located in \nnorth of Bengal and FPA India Kolkata branch which is catering to the population of south Bengal. \nUnder the project, FPA India Kalchini branch has expanded the geographical reach with SRH care in \nMadarihat block of Alipurduar District. The Satellite clinic established by FPA India in Madarihat \nunder one of the specially funded projects for comprehensive abortion care was closed down after \nthe funding was stopped, with Oak Foundation\u2019s partial grant support, this clinic has been revamped \nwith the staff, commodities, and maintenance. It is now being accessed by the people in and around \nMadarihat block. This block is divided into a diverse culture of different communities like Bengali, \nNepali, Muslim, Adivasi, Rava, Mech, Garo & Toto, having their origin back to different places in \nIndia. The services provided at the Satellite clinic are being accessed by these communities and \nreferral for SRH care has been done with FPA India\u2019s Kalchini RHFPC.  With an expansion under \nASPIRE project, Kalchini branch has taken up 17 new tea gardens in Madarihat and also covering 9 \nnew tea gardens in Kalchini block which were not regularly covered due to accessibility issues. The \nexpansion is estimated to cover an additional 2,50,000 population together. \nFPA India Kolkata branch has been working in urban, peri-urban areas covering slum population in \nand around Kolkata including Howrah, Hooghly as well as parts of Sunderbans closer to the satellite \nclinics of FPA India Kolkata branch near Lake garden, Topsia and Rajarhat. Under ASPIRE project, \nit intervenes in south Bengal through to 5 selected blocks of Sunderbans, i.e. Basanti, Canning, \nGosaba, Kultoli in 24 south Parganas and Hingalganj block in north 24 Parganas. With an expansion \nin 24 Parganas, Kolkata would be reaching out to approximately 8,00,000 new population over the \nperiod of project. \nExpansion includes working with women, men, transgender population, female and male sex \nworkers  in selected areas of key population such as Sonagachi.   \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \nUnderstanding the health needs and capacities. \nKalchini: \nTo understand the communities\u2019 health needs, social heath determinants and current capacities of the \nexisting healthcare system, Kalchini conducted 7 FGDs with ASHAs, ANMs, AWWs, PRI members, \nTea garden health service providers and tea garden community members. The findings indicated the \nneed of clinical training to the current service providers for sexual and reproductive health. There is \nno apprehension amongst the community members for accessing services at the public health facility \nhowever, public health facilities and tea garden hospitals are not equipped with the staff and \ncommodities.  It is resulting in either people ignoring the health needs or availing health services at \nthe private health facilities. Most of the tea garden hospitals in the selected intervention areas are \nnon-functional and some tea gardens in Kalchini are accessed by the community but these hospitals \nare largely dependent on external sources like FPA India for commodities and services. \nKolkata (Sunderbans): \nIn Sunderbans however, in depth interviews were conducted with local women along with 26 FGDs \nwith local women and men\u2019s groups, frontline workers, PRI members because it was completely new \nintervention area taken by FPA India for SRH care. The healthcare infrastructure in Sunderbans in \nselected 5 blocks was found to be fragmented largely because of its locale which poses difficulty in \naccessing the islands. Institutionalized health care is either non-existent or inadequate. This leaves \nhealthcare choices for the people of these areas limited to indigenous healthcare providers using \nherbal medicinal supplements from forest resources and private healthcare providers which demand \nout of pocket expenses. There is a question on the qualifications of the private health care providers \nas well. Both the branches have started their interventions in the selected areas, however building \nrapport and increasing accessibility may take time for focused SRH intervention especially to avail \nsafe abortion care and services related to gender based violence. \nAdvocacy and networking with key stakeholders for health system strengthening. \nHealth systems and polices have a critical role in determining the manner in which health services \nare delivered, utilized, and affect health outcomes. Health is a state matter and therefore, to influence \nthe systems for positive outcomes, FPA India works in close partnerships with central and most state \ngovernments. With respect to West Bengal, FPA India is a Member in various district level \ncommittees like District Health & Family Welfare Samiti (Executive Member), District Task Force \nMeeting (Executive Committee Member), District MTP Committee (Executive Committee \nMember), Block Health & Family Welfare Committee, kalchini (Executive Committee Member) \nand Block Disaster Committee-Kalchini and Kolkata (Member) and the representative of FPA India \nfrom Kalchini and Kolkata participate in the meetings being held by these committee heads on \nregular basis. The Kalchini branch also attends regular district MIS meetings organized by the health \ndepartment to understand the progress, to review the available resources with district authority and \nprovide recommendations with district level policy makers. During the reporting period, 12 meetings \nwere conducted at district level which were attended by FPA India representative. Issues related to \nsafe abortion services and budget for Palaki ambulance project in Buxa Dooars were discussed \nduring these meetings and forwarded to State NHM.  As a result of previous series of meetings in \nthis regard and participation in 12 meetings during the reporting period, Buxa Dooars Palaki \nambulance project is sanctioned in District and state PIP by NHM.   \nThe Palaki ambulance is an initiative by FPA India as a public private partnership model (PPP) with \nhealth Alipurduar district health department to transport pregnant women and persons in need of \nfacility based emergency and other Medical care, including, Institutional delivery and other general \nhealth, from the terrain of the Buxa Dooars to the nearest Govt. Hospital. The Palaki is being used \nwith support of volunteers of FPA India and local people. \nIt has been equipped with informative materials on protection of girl child, institutional delivery and \nother SRH issues. It operates or twenty four hours per day, seven days a week, providing a Basic \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \nLife Support (BLS) medical care. Palki Ambulance\u201d has made a positive impact on pregnant women \nand the local populace and has been recognized by district health system as a best practice. \nCapacity building of health care providers. \nKalchini: \nKalchini branch conducted following meetings to plan capacity building trainings for SRH care for \nthe Government health care Providers during the reporting period: \n\u2022 Madarihat Rural Hospital under Madarihat Gram Panchayet which was attended by BMHO, \nMOs, GNMS- ANMS and 36 ASHAs from Madarihat. \n\u2022 Meetings with Birpara State General Hospital were attended by Superintendent, Mo and other \nstaff. \n\u2022 MOs and GNMs of Sisujhumra PHC, Sisubari PHC, Totopara PHC also attended the meetings \norganized for them to initiate the discussion for SRH trainings. \nKolkata: \n\u2022 One training on SRH care was conducted in Bharatghar Nursing Home in basanti by Kolkata \nbranch for the clinical and para medical staff. Apart from the nursing home staff,  7 private \nmedical practitioners from the Kochukhali and Satjalia gram panchayats in Gosaba block \nattended 1 SRH training each. \n\u2022 Kolkata branch conducted one meeting with the Basanti Gramin Hospital which was attended \nby BMOH and other staff. The focus of the meeting was SRH training and smooth referral \nfor general health care. It will need subsequent meetings and follow-up to train the staff to \nprovide the SRH care. \n\u2022 For the partnership with private health care providers, 2 RMOs, 30 on call doctors and 18 \nstaff nurses from the private hospitals in Birpara are at the discussion stage, trainings will be \nconducted, and partnership will be formalized with them in the 2nd phase. \n\u2022 A total of 182 ASHAs and 56 ANMS have been sensitized by Kalchini branch for SRH care. \nMobilizing champions to advocate for SRHR. \nKalchini: \nTotal 19 mothers clubs were formed in newly selected tea gardens by Kalchini branch wherein 190 \nnew women members were included in the group of network for SRHR and mitigation of gender \nbased violence. Members of the Mothers Club are community-based volunteers who work towards \ncommunity empowerment.   \nKolkata: \n\u2022 FPA India\u2019s intervention in Kolkata has resulted in formation of total 35 women\u2019s groups \ncomprise of 275 members across 15 gram panchayats. All the groups have attended at least 1 \nsession each on gender based violence and sexual reproductive health care. These groups will \nbe further strengthened to address the violence as well as to sensitize the young people from \nthe community on SRH and GBV issues. \n\u2022 Total 27 meetings were conducted for sensitization on SRHR and GBV with these groups. \nThe formal trainings will be conducted subsequently to strengthen the capacities for \nadvocating for the rights of women.  \n\u2022 Kolkata branch has appointed 6 new link workers in Sunderbans in 2023, along with \nthem,  local ASHAs and ANMS were mobilized through total 50 + meetings during the \nreporting period to sensitize about SRH care. Total 9 SRH trainings were conducted for these \nfrontline workers. \n \n \nOak Progress Report.    5 \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n\u2022 The local district authorities rely on the FPAI team in Kalchini to deliver last mile \ncontraceptive supplies and immunization services to needy populations in hilly terrains where \nthere are no motorable roads or government health facilities. While the intervention by FPA \nIndia helps to build partnership with Government, it consumes lot of resources in order to \nmake health care available and accessible to the most needy population. \n\u2022 It is challenging to get cooperation of BDOs for capacity building and interventions in \nSunderbans with health facilities as they expect approval from dept of Sunderbans affairs or \nstate government to implement activities. However, local administration like panchayat \nmembers are cooperative and provide support to the team. \n\u2022 The selected intervention areas of Sunderbans are financial and human resource consuming. \nThe meetings in regard to advocacy and partnership with government officials for capacity \nbuilding, trainings of grassroot level staff, doctors, and strengthening the hospital systems \netc.  require participation of experienced and senior staff at the initial stage. These areas are \ngeographically hard to reach and in order to return to the cities after intervention, teams need \nto adhere to timings of transports available. Hence, simultaneously meetings and service \ndelivery become difficult to cover both service delivery and advocacy aspects hence it also \nresults in delay/ slow progress.   \n\u2022 Currently there is no programme implementation plan being directly implemented as per the \nbudget at district level. District health administration has been collecting information through \nthe meetings conducted with public health officials and other partners where the issues of \nimplementation and special project budgets are being discussed. However, as the PIP of 2022-\n2024 is already done and revision will be done in 2023, there is no action, directive suggested \nso far. The 1st scope to put forward the suggestions would come in the mid- review meeting.  \n\u2022 While most of the Tea garden hospitals are defunct, the staff is present in the hospital and \nmany of them have not undergone any clinical training for a long time. This training will be \nconducted at the later stage when funds for commodities are strengthened at the tea garden \nlevel to ensure that the staff undergone training have sufficient commodities and resources to \nprovide these services.  \n \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective \nTo empower adolescents, young women, and key population groups from vulnerable and/or \nmarginalized communities with life skills and income generation opportunities in a gender-\njust environment. \nThis objective attempts to address norm change through gender-transformative interventions to \nsupport GBV survivors; create an enabling environment that pre-empts gender-based violence and \nsupports the rehabilitation of survivors, and works towards primary prevention of GBV and \ntransitioning of adolescents into responsible citizens through comprehensive sexuality education.  \n \n \n \nOak Progress Report.    6 \n \n7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nMobilizing young voices. \nKalchini: \nDuring the reporting period, FPA India Kalchini branch formed total 6 new youth groups in \nMadarihat block, which has been selected for an expansion. The groups have a total of 66 youth \nmembers from Gopalpur, Tulsipara, Singhania, Dalmore and Dumchipara. On forming the groups \nyouth members were oriented about the project and participated in the sensitization meetings \nconducted for them on gender-based violence, SRH and youth and safe abortion care. \nKolkata: \nKolkata branch formed 30 new groups in Sunderbans with young people across 5 blocks. The initial \nwork with young people had started in the areas which are connected to city by road like Basanti and \nCanning. The branch originally had some contacts in Basanti with CBOs and other Kolkata based \nNGOs who work in Basanti block on various issues. These earlier collaborations helped the team to \nbuild the rapport with young people during the initial health camps conducted in the villages of \nBasanti block.  Out of total 30 groups formed; 13 groups of 55 young people are formed in Basanti \nblock followed by Hingalganj in north 24 parganas which is an isolated block. Together in Jogeshganj \nand Sahenkhali of Hingalganj, there are total 7 groups formed with 34 young people. These groups \nare at the initial phase and in some areas,  the group is as small as 2 members at present. However, \nthese young people help the teams in mobilization, accompany them in case of meetings with stake \nholders etc. gradually they are expected to expand the group with their peers. \nCapacity building and connecting dots for partnership. \nKalchini: \n\u2022 FPA India Kalchini has a partnership developed with Birpara Welfare Organization for the \nreferrals of clients for livelihood skills learning. In the reporting year, total 8 gender-based \nsurvivors identified from the Madarihat areas were sent to Birpara Organization who attended \ntailoring course. \n\u2022 FPA India has initiated the partnership with NGO Pratham, a grantee NGO of Oak Foundation \nfor referrals of GBV survivors from north Bengal intervention areas to avail life skills and \nalternative livelihood opportunities. A pilot batch of identified GBV survivors will be sent to \nPratham and clients will be followed up for the retention of job opportunities provided to them \nby Pratham on completion of the course.   \nKolkata: \n\u2022 In Sunderbans meetings have been conducted with community members to understand the \nlivelihood options and women and young people from the community, have suggested few \noptions like bee-hiving, local spices and flowers business etc. However, it has been seen by \nthe community members as an opportunity for income generation in general and not specific \nto the women survivors of gender based violence. The concept of gender-based violence \nwithin the family and peripheries take time to shape up and communities in Sundarbans are \ngoing through the process of it and at initial phase.  \n\u2022 Another oak Grantee, Liver Foundation, has planned their intervention in Sunderbans and 3 \nmeetings have been conducted with Liver Foundation for the partnership. This partnership \nwill result in training the volunteers of Liver foundation in SRH and gender-based violence \nwho can further provide the care in the community.  \n \nOak Progress Report.    7 \nComprehensive sexuality education for young people \nKalchini: \n\u2022 In north Bengal, through FPA India\u2019s comprehensive Sexuality education programme total \n61 sessions were conducted in Madarihat through which 3,948 young adolescent boys and \ngirls from schools were sensitized, these participants were from class 7th to 11th. \n\u2022 For the out of school adolescents such 37 sessions were conducted on Relationship, \nCommunication Skill, HIV/AIDS, Safe Abortion, GBV, RTI, Contraception which reached \nout to 949 young people \nKolkata: \n\u2022 In Sunderbans the SCEs were conducted in the 8 schools. Total 350  school going children \nattended the CSE sessions as follows: Basanti ( 108 children), Goasaba ( 81 children), Kultoli \n( 55 children) and Hingalganj ( 106 children). \n\u2022 While partnerships with schools are taking shape in Sunderbans, the intervention in the \ncommunity via CSE sessions has much progressed. Total 64 sessions on CSEs were \nconducted across 5 intervention blocks which reached out to 1,220 young people. The \nresponse for these sessions in the community is highest in Kultoli block.  The community \nstrategy is also helping to build the rapport with parents and bringing young people together \nto advocate for SRHR. \nTaking the onus, capacity building of teachers for CSE \nKalchini: \nTo build capacities of the schoolteachers to conduct comprehensive abortion sessions for the \nadolescents, total 5 teacher trainings were conducted in north Bengal\u2019s schools which were attended \nby 63 teachers across 28 schools. On completing the ToT, total 35 sessions were conducted by the \nnewly trained teachers in the schools.   \nFPA India Kalchini branch\u2019s presence in Madarihat with comprehensive abortion care services is \nresulting in healthy partnerships with other stakeholders well. \nKolkata: \nTotal 8 ToTs were conducted by Kolkata branch for 40 teachers across 4 blocks except Canning. \nThe response to initiate the training independently was not very positive in Sunderbans. A top-\ndown approach may work, but it won\u2019t have the onus from the schools for sustained intervention \nwhich has been observed in Kalchini.   \n \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nIt is challenging to get cooperation of BDOs for capacity building and interventions in Sunderbans \nwith health facilities as they expect formal health and family welfare department, West Bengal to \nimplement any activities. At present, the blocks selected under Sunderbans have weak public health \nfacilities and it is a new geography for FPAI, hence, for the participation of ASHAs, AWWs, school \nstaff is taking time without formal approvals. While some of the ASHAs are very cooperative and \nsupporting during the health sessions being conducted, organizing capacity building trainings with \nthem in a big group at a time is difficult. However, local administration like panchayat members are \ncooperative and provide support to the team and with their help it will be taken up. \n \nOak Progress Report.    8 \n \n \n \n7.3.a. Objective 3 Objective \nTo strengthen access to a comprehensive range of quality SRH services through clinic and \noutreach-based models of service delivery, leveraging technology and partnerships in new \nand existing operational areas under FPA India Kalchini and Kolkata Branches. \n \n \n \n7.3.b. Objective 3 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nStrengthening the access to sexual and reproductive health care: Outcome of satellite clinic \nunder the project in North Bengal (Kalchini): \n\u2022 Total 6,338 new clients registered at the Satellite clinic at Madarihat and availed the SRH \ncare. \n\u2022 Total 557 women availed the management of medical abortion during the reporting period.  \n\u2022 Total 157 new users received 10 years intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCD) at Satellite \nclinic which accounts to 6% contribution to the total IUCD insertion to women in the \nreporting period by Kalchini branch. \n\u2022 557 new women and 20,366 continued users availed the oral pills through Satellite clinic as \na family planning method. \n\u2022 2,626 women were screened for gender-based violence and provided counselling. \nStrengthening the access to sexual and reproductive health care: Reaching out to unreached- \nthe outreach intervention \nKolkata intervention: \nThe service delivery model for Sunderbans by Kolkata branch is through outreach based special \nservice sessions. During the reporting period, the team provided general health and sexual \nreproductive health care to total 8,745 people out of which 4,742 were women, mainly from \nreproductive age group. \nThe two most critical islands which FPA India has taken up under this project: Chota Mulla Khali \nand Kumirbari, provided health services to 570 people in just two outreach camps which shows the \nneed of health services in that area. Total 293 women benefitted through 2 camps on these islands. \nApart from common ailments and anemia, issues like white discharge, irregular menstruation were \nfound to be common amongst women.  These islands are away from the land and Hospital \naccessibility to Canning is not just cost extensive but also has limited transportation \noptions.  However, Chota Mulla Khali has a PHC in semi functional state where delivery facility is \nalso available.  So far, multiple meetings have been conducted with stakeholders in Chota mulla \nKhali, and the local leaders and members on village committee have shown willingness to work \naround health issues of people living on these islands.  FPA India Kolkata will be building capacities \nof the Hospital staff to provide sexual and reproductive services in subsequent phases which will help \nboth the island to avail health services at low cost and with regular intervals. \n \nOak Progress Report.    9 \nFor FPA India Kolkata, the 1st year of intervention was crucial to build rapport in selected blocks of \n24 Parganas. The capacity building of existing health facilities and health care providers for sexual \nreproductive care is a long process, hence, while the team was parallelly working around collating \ndata, building rapport with health facilities, establishing contacts with various local CBOs and \nfrontline workers, there were multiple visits conducted to the intervention blocks with the team of \ndoctors and para medical staff to provide the health care in the outreach camps. \nThe team conducted total 44 outreach health service sessions in the villages of selected 5 GPs ( 10 in \nBasanti, 9 in Gosaba, 11 in Kultoli, 5 in Canning, and 9 in Hingalganj)  with general health and sexual \nreproductive health care provision which benefitted total 8,745 people. 54 % of the population who \navailed services were women. \nThe branch also conducted 5 special service sessions in the high need areas of female sex workers at \nSonagachi, Tollugunj and Rambagan reaching out to 430 women, 65 men and 3 children from key \npopulation. While these sessions were focused on sexual and reproductive health, general health care \nwas also provided on demand. \nKalchini intervention in outreach: \nDuring the reporting period with support from Oak Foundation grant and FPA India\u2019s initiatives, \ntotal 49 health service sessions were conducted in new intervention area which were combined health \nsessions for general health and sexual reproductive health care. Total 2,223 community members \navailed the services out of which 1,471 (66%) were women in reproductive age groups, 533 (24 %) \nwere men and remaining 219 were children under 14 years.  \nThe outcomes of all Service delivery points: RHFPC, Satellite clinics, Associate clinics, CBDs \nand Outreach for Kalchini and Kolkata: \nThe following table[i] depicts collated impact of the SRH intervention done by FPA India\u2019s Kolkata \nand Kalchini branches.

Total 2, 95, 582 additional services were provided \ntogether by Kalchini and Kolkata compared to the baseline which are reported as per the \nquality service guidelines.  We are expecting 7-10  % increase every year in the uptake of \nSRH services by expanding the geography in the most needy areas.  \n\u2022 While the number of abortions provided by RHFPCs has increased by 25%, there is a 19% \ndecline in the Associated clinic performance. On the ground of noncompliance of the quality-\n \nOak Progress Report.    11 \nof-care norms, some associated clinics\u2019 data is not included as per the decision in data \ncollection methodology taken by FPA India. More details on this are available in the", "Significant changes": "significant changes section. While there was a good response to reopening of satellite clinic, \nthere is sharp decline in the abortion care provided at the satellite clinic compared to the \nbaseline. Till 2020- mid 2021, this satellite clinic was supported with a special grant to provide \nfocused comprehensive abortion care. This support had given an opportunity to take medical \nmethod of abortion to the grassroot with the quality. The cost of these services is high, while \nFPA India is looking for other opportunities to revamp these services, reaching out with \nabortion care with same quantum is currently difficult within available budget. The loss of \nfunds has impacted the couple year protection also, which is calculated basis the contraceptive \nservices provided in the year. \n\u2022 The association with SHGs and LVGs has increased with 20% by inclusion of 73 new SHGs \nat both the branches. \n\u2022 As both branches entered into new intervention areas, a large number of clients availing \nservices were screened for gender-based violence and provided with the counselling. As a \nresult, with an additional 4,990 screening and counselling the number of GBV screening has \nalmost doubled ( 88% increase) from 5,670 to 10,660. \n\u2022 The Teachers\u2019 training on CSE were focused during the year which resulted in new \nassociations with total 512 teachers ( original intervention areas of FPA India and new areas) \nwho can be motivated further to conduct the SCE sessions in the schools. \nDisaster preparedness and MISP. \nThe intervention areas selected from Sunderbans are susceptible to natural calamities like cyclones \nthat can throw planned interventions out of gear, stretch health systems and exacerbate \nvulnerabilities. Therefore, under the project, disaster preparedness trainings are considered for the \ncapacity building of the community members and stakeholders. The intervention for disaster \npreparedness under ASPIRE project is anticipated in phase 2. FPA India has received a special grant \n: SPRINT IV, for the capacity building of the staff and community members for disaster preparedness \nthrough MISP (Minimum Initial Service Package) training.  During the reporting period, 1 MISP \ntraining was held in May 2023 where youth volunteers, local NGOs, local link workers, participated. \nAlthough the training was planned for 3 full days, it was conducted only for one day due to gram \npanchayat elections. A fresh training will be conducted in phase II. \nUnder SPRINT project, sexual and gender-based violence training was also conducted in Sudnerbans. \nThe topics covered in the training program were: concept of SGBV, contributing factors of SGBV, \nconsequences of SGBV, global and national SGBV prevalence, national legal frameworks, guiding \nprinciples of providing survivor centered care and communication skills. \nOne media sensitization program was organized in May 2023 by involving all the local and national \nnews channels to sensitize about disaster preparedness. \nNGOs like Sunderban KNS foundation, Indian Red Cross Society, Benkunthapur Shishu Seba \nKendra, Leprosy mission,  Satjelia Vivekananda Milan Sangh, SNP+, Sonagachi Durbar, Manab \nTirtha Sevashram, Human Rights Association participated and partnered for the MISP and disaster \nintervention.  \n[i] These are total impacts meaning they include impacts that were already being averted previously \nbecause some women were already using family planning services. \n[ii] The disability-adjusted life year is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number \nof years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death. It was developed in the 1990s as a way of \ncomparing the overall health and life expectancy of different countries \n  \n  \n \nOak Progress Report.    12 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n7.3.c. Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n\u2022 Despite the doctors in the public facilities are more qualified and skilled than the private \ndoctors, their skills are not being utilized optimally for marginalized people. Frequent \nabsenteeism and unavailability of commodities are still leading to avoidance of public health \nfacilities by people. As a result, people visit local private practitioners, ignoring the available \npublic health units, and pay beyond their financial capacity. There is a persistent negative \nattitude towards public health facilities which has been observed and that will take time to \nchange while the work with facility and authority will continue to strengthen the system. \n\u2022 Since there was a provision of budget through special grant under humanitarian work being \nconducted by FPA India, FPA India Kolkata branch had planned more trainings with gram \npanchayat workers, secretaries and Pradhans in areas of Sunderbans, however due to gram \npanchayat elections, it had to postpone over two months. Post election, new people joined in \nsome of the GPs and rapport built with earlier people could not be utilized formally as a \npartnership with panchayat people. \n \n \n8. Significant changes. If applicable and not addressed in the challenges and obstacles question for a particular \nobjective, please state any changes that occurred over the last grant period affecting grant terms and goal delivery (i.e., key \nstaffing, leadership, timeline or organisational structural changes).   \n* Please note that financial-oriented updates (i.e., actual funding received, funding spend-down changes) should be \ncommented on within the Oak Budget to Actuals Report. \n\u2022 In December 2022, FPA India had conducted the national level training for Ministry of health \nand Family Welfare (MoHFW) on insertion of subdermal single rod contraceptive implants \n(hormonal implants). Dr. S.K. Sikdar, Advisor, FP, MoHFW and his team attended the hands-\non training in Delhi.  Through this experience, the Country Lead for Jhpiego requested for a \ntraining program for 5 doctors from Assam which was conducted in January 2023.  Similarly, \nMoHFW planned national level training of 30 Master Trainers (MTOT) on insertion of \nsubdermal single rod contraceptive implants in 3 locations with the support of FPA India. \nThese trainings were conducted in Delhi, Dharwad and Kolkata. The participants for MTOT \nwere from Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and \nOrissa. The trainees majorly from Medical Colleges, will have to further conduct the implants \ntraining for service providers in their respective districts as per the plan formulated by \nMoHFW. \nDr. Rathnamala Desai, President, FPAI was the Core National Master Trainer for all the 3 \ntraining programmes. \n \nOak Progress Report.    13 \n\u2022 In year 2023, FPA India took a decision of re-looking the methodologies of collecting data at \ndifferent service delivery points. In the process, some of the branches including FPAI Kolkata \nbranch had to drop out some partner associated clinics due to their inability to meet the criteria \nof quality-of-care services expected to be delivered/ reported.  Hence, these branches of FPA \nIndia are unable to renew the partnerships and that has impacted the overall volume of the \ndata being reported for ASPIRE project. \n  \n \n \n9. Additional question(s): Please use this space to respond to any question(s) sent to you by the Oak programme team.  \nIf none were received, please leave this section blank. \n\u2022 What is the infrastructure in the gardens - are their social workers or women volunteers, local \ncommunities in these gardens? \nMother\u2019s club is an initiative in the tea Gardens for the community development through women \nempowerment with support from tea garden management. The chairperson of these clubs are the \nGarden Managers and the Hospital MO In-Charge or/ Labour Welfare officers or Assistant \nManagers plays the role of Member Secretary with 10 women members under each tea garden. \nFPA India works closely with these women volunteers in the tea gardens for the empowerment \nand enhancing sexual and reproductive health care in the tea garden community through the \nKalchini branch. These women are part of the community; hence, they are also available outside \ntea gardens for SRH care. \n\u2022 How did you arrive at the catchment population of 250,000? \nAs per the census 2011 population mentioned on \u2018Grammanchitra\u2019, the site of Ministry of \nPanchayati Raj, govt. of India which was referred for mapping, the population of Kalchini is \n3,85,108 out of which most of the areas FPA India is already working through intervention. The \npopulation of Madarihat shows 1,73,707 in 2022 census. The total population comes to \n5,58,815.  The Census site shows some indicator based expected increase in the population which \nconsidered following MoHFW published Population projection report, where, the population \ngrowth of west Bengal is  indicating 8%. Considering that, the estimated population of Madarihat \ncomes close to 1,90,000 . the remaining population estimation was taken for Kalchini\u2019s new tea \ngardens and few villages near Jaigaon are included. Thus, the estimation of 2,50,000 was \nconsidered for expansion. \n\u2022 Are there any of the clinical activities carried out in the gardens? \nApart from awareness and sensitization meetings, FPA India organizes special service sessions \nin the tea garden for general health care and SRH care. The screening of cervical cancer is also \ndone in the selected tea gardens for women. \n\u2022 Does this refer to the doctors or others as well? (The findings indicated the need of clinical \ntraining to the current service providers for sexual and reproductive health.) \n      This was with reference to the doctors as clinical service providers. \n\u2022 What is the contribution of the health department to the Palki Ambulance? \nFPA India volunteers have been active in Buxa doors to support for immunization, helping \nwomen to access hospitals for an institutional delivery. Kalchini branch had proposed the idea of \nPalki Ambulance to the district Administrator to ensure the safe and relatively easy transport of \npregnant women and other patients which was then proposed by him to health department for the \n \nOak Progress Report.    14 \napproval and implementation. The health department sanctioned the project implementation and \nalso planned to make more palkis which would be lighter in weight.  \n\u2022 Are there any training activities that target the doctors and nurses at the tea garden hospitals? \n(A total of 182 ASHAs and 56 ANMS have been sensitized by Kalchini branch for SRH care.) \nIn the past, FPA India had covered about 12 tea gardens for the training of clinical staff with \nsupport of special grant focusing on SRH care. However, in the last one and half years there are \nno trainings conducted for the tea garden clinical staff such as doctors and nurses. \n\u2022 Have you shared any recommendations from the FGDs findings with the department which \nmay have implications for the PIPs? \nThe recommendations were not shared in the meetings conducted so far. The data sharing in the \nmeetings was pertaining to the special project supported in Buxa Doors for SRH \nactivities.  However, it will be done in subsequent meetings where revisions in the PIP budget \nmay be considered. It will be done along with seeking approvals for the training of the doctors \navailable in the government facilities in Kalchini and Madarihat. \n\u2022 Can you share the age groups, gender and social profiles of the trainees? \nThe women referred for the livelihood skills trainings were mostly between the age groups of 30-\n35. Two amongst them were 24 years old. While all 8 were married at one point, the younger two \nwere deserted by their partners. All except one were survivors of domestic violence either by their \nintimate partners or family members. Four of them were from tribal community and three reported \nto be originally Nepali. \n\u2022 Since Gosaba is a common area for both, there is potential for providing comprehensive health \nawareness and referral services. \nDefinitely there is a potential to have for providing comprehensive health together. \nUnder the partnership with Liver foundation, FPA India will train all three categories of \nvolunteers of liver foundation in batches on sexual reproductive health, gender-based violence \nand minimum initial service package for humanitarian situations. On receiving trainings, \nvolunteers who are essentially from Gosaba block, can use the knowledge in the community along \nwith their dedicated work and also refer the clients when there is any health camp, they can also \nsupport in mobilization when the camps are being conducted. \n\u2022 Do you have sex-disaggregated data for the children and young people who attended these \nsessions? \nThe table below can explain gender disaggregated data for children and young people for the \nsessions attended in school and out of school (sessions in the community). Please note that the \ntable shared in the narrative report has data up to June 2023. The table shared below , has data up \nto July 2023 as received by the branches. Also, the data in the reporting system comes for entire \nintervention areas and not segregated for project specific. \n  \nTotal children and young people attended CSE sessions. 37,728 \nTotal male children and young people attended CSE sessions 14,349 (38.03%) \n  \nTotal female children and young people attended CSE sessions 23,340 (61.86%) \n  \nTotal other children and young people attended CSE sessions 39 (0.10%) \n  \n \nOak Progress Report.    15 \n    \nTotal children and young people attended CSE sessions in \nschools. \n25,153 (66.67% of the total) \nTotal male children and young people attended CSE sessions in \nschools. \n9,342 (37.14%) \nTotal female children and young people attended CSE sessions \nin schools. \n15,811 (62.86%) \n  \n    \nTotal children and young people attended CSE sessions in \nthe community (out of school). \n12,575 (33.33% of the total) \n  \nTotal male children and young people attended CSE sessions in \nthe community (out of school). \n5,007 (39.82%) \n  \nTotal female children and young people attended CSE sessions \nin the community (out of school). \n7,529 (59.87%) \n  \nTotal other children and young people attended CSE sessions in \nthe community (out of school). \n39 (0.31%) \n  \n  \n\u2022 Can you elaborate on some of the partnerships? (FPA India Kalchini branch\u2019s presence in \nMadarihat with comprehensive abortion care services is resulting in healthy partnerships with \nother stakeholders well.) \nThe partnerships with grassroot workers like ASHAs , AWWs which were developed earlier \nhelped the team to reach out to the community with health camps, and also to get referrals. While \npartnership with PRI members doesn\u2019t help in actually organizing the services, they were made \naware of the work being done in SRH field and the support of ASHAs , ANMs. Their support and \npresence in the outreach activities positively influences community people to access the services \nprovided in the outreach and also to access the Satellite clinic services. In terms of comprehensive \nsexuality education sessions, the classes taken earlier in the schools had helped to build \nrelationships with schoolteachers. Hence organizing ToTs resulting in teachers conducting the \nsessions  was possible within one year\u2019s time.  \n\u2022 How does the CSE module integrate aspects related to gender and diversity? \nFPA India has a comprehensive sexuality education module, designed to equip adolescents with \nknowledge, skills, attitudes and values related to sexuality and relationships. The aim of this CSE \nmodule is to encourage young adolescents to enjoy the growing up phase safely, responsibly and \nhealthily. As one of the components, \u2018Gender and Diversity\u2019 is introduced in the module. The \nsessions based on Gender and Diversity cover difference between gender and sex; exploring \ngender roles and attributes; understanding perceptions of masculinity and femininity within the \nfamily and across the life cycle; society\u2019s changing norms and values; manifestations and \nconsequences of gender bias, myths; and inequality, recognizing and understanding the range of \ndiversity in our lives (e.g., faith, culture, ethnicity, socio-economic status, ability/disability, HIV \nstatus and sexual orientation); recognizing discrimination, its damaging effects and being able to \ndeal with it; developing a belief in equality etc. \n\u2022 Have you spoken to IPAS in this regard as they have a strong presence in the state \ndepartments? \n \nOak Progress Report.    16 \nThere is an update on this which is of August 2023. At present, total 265 ASHAs and 2 ANMS \nhave undergone the training in Sunderbans on SRH. The meetings were conducted by FPA India \nKolkata BM in this regard with block medical officer of health, Basanti Rural Hospital and with \nhis directive and approval the training was conducted on 24th August in Basanti. \nFPA India has a partnership with IPAS independently for SRH work as well and wherever \napplicable, the partnership will be explored for work in Sunderbans. \n\u2022 Please send me the baseline reports as it was meant to provide the benchmarks to assess the \nannual progress. I suggest that you use them to reflect the % changes as currently the figures \nare mentioned in absolute terms.  Although the text  under the accomplishments is well-\nwritten, it will be great if you can refer to the approved outcomes in the future. Also, \nwherever applicable please provide sex- and social group- disaggregated data. \nI am sharing the baseline report separately as an attachment as it is a bit heavy in size. Also, \nhenceforth we will project the changes/ progress in the indicators as per the % change and \nalso basis the approved outcomes. \n\u2022 what is the strategy for engaging with the tea garden management for ensuring services to \nthe workers and their families ? and the plan to engage with state departments to inform \nprogrammes/policies based on the refined findings from  the FGDs and the direct \ninterventions? \nRegarding the strategies to engage the tea garden management for ensuring services to the \nworkers and their families, currently FPA India is providing the general health and SRH care \nservices in the Tea gardens along with awareness / sensitization meetings with \nmanagements\u2019  permission. The regular contact with other club members like youth club, \ncommunity clubs in the villages reflect in the referral services to the RHFPC to ensure the \nservices are accessible and affordable to the community women. FPA India has worked in the \npast with some of the tea gardens (about 12 gardens from Kalchini) and trained the clinical \nstaff, however, considering the turnover of clinical staff, referrals are made to the hospital for \ngeneral care and for SRH care mostly people prefer to come to FPA India.    \nAlso, as a next step, in December 2023, while PIP revisions may happen in review meeting, \nFPA India Kalchini branch has planned to send a proposal for special projects where the FDG \nfinding will also be presented. There will be an attempt to involve youth members or women \nvolunteers from the community during the meetings. \n\u2022 Is there a reason for not mentioning this source (Sprint IV) in the table 5 of the finance report? \nContribution of Sprint IV has been included under IPPF, as the grant is coming from IPPF, \nalso , inserting additional row was not working in the protected file.    \n\u2022 With respect to the finance report, please check the year 1 budget figures (both Total and \nOak)  from the grant letter as they do not match. Do let us know if you are expecting any \nrevisions in the year 2 budget. \nAs per instruction given in \u201cOak Budget to Actuals Report\u201d (please refer point no.4.) , the \n\u2018Annual budget\u2019 must match exactly what was approved In the grant letter unless a Budget \nRevision Form was approved, in which case the revised amount should be listed. Therefore, \nannual budget for reporting period showed  as per Budget Revision i.e. (Total project) INR \n183,04,576 & (OAK) INR 92,62,337. \nBasis the mail from Oak Foundation indicating the in principal approval on six field workers \nfor Sunerbans for the project period, some revisions are made in the budget along with \nadjusting the original budget. The revisions made will be shared by the Finance and Accounts \nteam for Year 2 (July 2023 to June 2024). The variance in % contribution is mainly due to \nadditional budget for field workers. \n \n \nOak Progress Report.    17 \n \nII.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nBackground: \nUnder this project, the activities started with learning and understanding the process and  using the \ndifferent tools like social mapping, listing, scoring and ranking, power analysis, daily routine \nactivities, mobility map, migration chart, SWOC (strength weakness opportunity and challenges) \nanalysis of the vulnerable families under participatory vulnerability and capacity assessment, base \nline study were done. \nThere were vulnerabilities found among the marginal farmers families, women particularly of women \nheaded families, agri-labourer, landless labourer and migrant labourer, adolescents both boys and \ngirls of the resource poor families particularly, aged and physically challenged persons, who are in \nvery difficult situation in socio-economic, environment and cultural point of view. \nOn the basis of the findings of vulnerabilities came out, the micro plan chalked out. Accordingly the \nprocess of empowering of the community groups started with them after prioritization of the problems \nof the reference groups of adolescents, women, marginal farmers and labourers, aged and physically \nchallenged persons. \nThe three reference villages are 1) Ram Nagar Abad, 2) Gurudaspur, 3) Paschim Sridhar Pur of \nDigambarpur Gram Panchayat of Pathar Pratima block of Sundarban, West Bengal, India. \nThe activities   were as follows: \nAdolescents both boys and girls groups formed: \n       Total groups of adolescents formed : 14 (one boys and one girls group, other 12 are mixed \ngroups) \nTotal members of those 14 groups are 312 (boys-70, girls-242) \nBecoming proactive to take action thinking in a safe space of knowledge building, \nunderstanding and sharing and trust building: \nAdolescents are beginning to think and sharing their problems with peers, where confidentiality is \nalso maintained, where there is free and open space for sharing and understanding with game mode \nof facilitation, question and answer session, storytelling, interacting session etc. \nThey have started to think on doing some work and taking shared responsibility for any action of \nplantation and nurturing, plastic collection and rejection campaigning, wall writing and wall painting \nfor community awareness, other social actions. Collective leadership is promoted among them. \nInterest grown among the adolescent groups getting opportunities of fun and learning together. \nBonding and friendship made among the adolescents with identity mapping, ground rules setting, \ngoal setting etc. \nBehavior changes among boys, they realized that girls should be regarded equally with boys where \neve- teasing and other negative thinking and behavior towards girls should be changed and stopped \nand treated equally. Negative mannerism that is demeaned to girls customarily by boys is being \nreduced as the girls shared. \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \nParents are being cooperative and supportive towards engagement of their children. Parents are \nspending time with children, talking to them, listening to their views. Building strong relationship \nand understanding with the parents of adolescents on their engagement in groups/collectives and \ndiscussion on building knowledge, and change of attitude and behavior in daily life. \nPlanning to collectively talk to panchayat for regular supply of sanitary pad for the adolescent girls. \nAlso to go in to dialogue with school authority for hygiene to be maintained at school toilet for girls \nparticularly. Knowledge building of the adolescent groups on gender, wants and need, basic human \nrights, child rights, know yourself, understanding on societal context, adolescent health and hygiene, \nissues of menstruation, thinking and understanding of what is right and wrong concepts and practices \nduring menstruation cycle, physical and mental or emotional changes of adolescent ages, which is \nnatural and normal as realized. \nThe other changes what are seen among the groups of adolescents as follows: \ni. The adolescents both boys and girls have mutually accepted the physically challenged, \nminority group(muslims), school drop out and all the castes altogether in their groups, \nbonding and friendship made with each other. \nii. They are attending meeting regularly as scheduled. Their parents are also becoming \ncooperative. \niii. Case of sexual abuse is shared with field worker. Free and open space created where they are \nsharing their opinion, problems and thinking to mitigate the same. \niv. They have built trust on the facilitator as their friend and guide. They are gradually able to \novercome their uneasy complexity to express views and opinion on issues and matters, what \nthey cannot share with parents and members of their families. Few cases of child abuse, school \ndropout, and early marriage have come out. \n\u2022 Collective action taken so far by the adolescent groups- in progress: \ni. Celebration on Children Day: \nii. Collective action by the adolescent collectives on awareness on pandemic: \niii. Peer to peer support to reduce school dropout and child labour: \niv. Advocacy for VLCPC formation : \nv. Celebration of world environment day, wall painting, plantation by the adolescent group: \nvi. Plastic rejection propagation drive by the adolescent groups and plantation: They have also \nplanned to continue the process initiated by them to collect plastics on regular basis at their \nhome and surroundings, which will be collected by the panchayat sending van to their locality. \nvii. Celebration of independence day by the adolescents group: \nviii. Engagement of adolescent groups with local water user committee: As per their aspiration it \nshould be functioning well for the benefit of the water user families and the community at \nlarge. The adolescent group also said that they would also visit and meet another water user \ncommittee where the problems if any, can be solved in this way. \nix. They have begun to have sanitary napkin from the health personnel where some are hesitate \nto talk. \nActivities with Physically challenged adolescents: \n10 adolescents of 10-16 years of age group identified and households visited. Out of ten, the three \nhave no registration card i.e. certificate of disability. \nThe respective families are trying to contact with subdivisional hospital of Kakdwip to have their \ndoctors certificate at first and then to apply for handicapped certificates. \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \nThe others seven have card and accessed the social security scheme of Manobik pension. \n  Marginal farmers group formed: \n\u2022 Total farmers group formed : 7 \n\u2022 Total members involved with the farmers group: 127 (M-  14, F- 113), \nFarmers are beginning to learn and expose skill and knowledge, understanding, sharing and \npractices of agro-eco system management: \n\u2022 Mostly women farmers are engaged in the process of development and coming forward with \ntheir leadership.

Fruitful discussion cannot be \nhappened with active participation from all as the absentees are unable to link thoughts with \nnew content. \n\u2022 Particularly boys of 16+ are less interested to join the group, is a great challenge to bring them \ninto the process. \n\u2022 School time and sometimes sudden and frequent changes of tuition time of the adolescent \nboys and girls did not match with the time of meeting. \n\u2022 Basically farmers are reluctant to adopt new scientific method of farming due to their \nnegligence of hard toil. Sometimes they present lame excuse to avoid this cultivation process. \nInstead women are becoming interested and given focus. \n\u2022 Farmers mostly expect some material supports of direct gain. Few farmers think, it would be \nof help in farming. \n\u2022 Some parents are having less caring and importance over their siblings, which cause \nirregularities in attending adolescent meeting. \n\u2022 It is difficult to have much number of male farmers in time of training or discussion due to \ntheir busy schedule of livelihood activities and having lack of interest to join. \n\u2022  Heavy rainfall, tuition, occasion and festival cause to postpone the session of adolescent \ncollectives. \n\u2022 Men and women are also busy in household chores, very less time in hand to attend meeting \nas they shared. \n\u2022 Some are also hesitating to talk. \nLearnings and adjustments: \n\u2022 Rapport building with the community is to be made very intensively. \n\u2022 Ensure community participation in any session growing interest among the participants \nthrough creating an open and learning environment, a special day for them. \n\u2022 More information and more support which is beneficial for community are to be provided, \nwhere they are also facilitated to thinking any new for their own. \n\u2022 Home visit with interaction on regular basis with the parents/farmers for trust building and \nclearing of any doubt can be a good strategy. \n\u2022 Community leadership and feeling of ownership by the community would be effective in \nexecuting any plan. \n\u2022 Regular monitoring and handholding support to the reference people are to be provided. \n\u2022 Date, time and venue of meeting are fixed by the community as convenient for them. \n \n \n \n7.2.a.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nSwaniti Initiative conducted a baseline study to determine the accessibility of Government \u2018Social \nProtection\u2019 schemes by tea garden workers, across gardens in four districts of West Bengal i.e \nDarjeeling, Alipurduar, Kochbihar, and Jalpaiguri.  \nThe study included a sample of 7488 respondents from these four districts of West Bengal. The \nstudy was conducted using three methods: Household surveys, semi-structured interviews, and \nfocused group discussions. The data was collected by Swaniti team and volunteers through digital \nintervention of Surveyman\u2013a survey management tool.  \n  \nUsing this report as a backbone, Swaniti designed interventions across all the 4 districts mentioned \nabove. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n7.1.c.

However, our swaniti team  and volunteers were able to explain the \npurpose of the study and its potential benefits to the tea workers.  \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \n\u2022 Access to information was another challenge, with most respondents needing to be made \naware of important social protection schemes. The surveyors had to explain these schemes \nand how the tea workers could benefit from them. \nKey Learning \nOverall, the study highlights the need for greater awareness and accessibility of  Government \n\u2018Social Protection\u2019 schemes for tea garden workers in West Bengal. There is a need for robust \nmechanisms to be placed to ensure that all the tea garden workers receive benefits from these \nschemes. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n7.2.a.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nSwaniti initiative collaborated with the Department of Post, Government of  West Bengal, and \norganized the Aadhaar enrollment and Correction camp in Balasun, Dhooteria, Lingia, and \nGopalpur Tea Gardens. The camps aimed to reach out to as many people as possible and efficiently \nconduct the enrollment and correction processes. These camps successfully reached out a total of \n1,309 beneficiaries, further to which Swaniti will work on linking these beneficiaries to different \ngovernment schemes. \n  \nExample: A voice from the community - \n  \n\u201cHello my name is Sujata Manger and this is my son Ankit Manger he was unable to \nobtain an Aadhaar card, but thanks to this camp, he was able to get it without difficulty. He \nis not alone, there are a number of other people in the tea garden who also do not have \nan Aadhaar card. I am now optimistic that my son will be able to access different \ngovernment schemes after getting his Aadhaar card\u201d - Sujata Manager - Dhajea TG, \nDarjeeling \n  \nOutcomes of the Aadhar Correction Camps: \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \n1. The camps were able to enroll and correct the Aadhaar details of a total of 1,309 \nbeneficiaries. These beneficiaries were able to obtain their Aadhaar cards without any \ndifficulty and ensure their details were updated and accurate. \n2. Many tea garden workers in the vicinity, including Tumsun TE, Munda, Miling, Kalej \nValley TG, and Samirkpani TE, were able to get their Aadhaar cards corrected conveniently \nas a result of the camps. This helped them avoid the inconvenience and expense of traveling \nlong distances to access Aadhaar services. \n3. The teams working at the camps conducted awareness sessions to educate people about the \nimportance of Aadhaar and its benefits. This helped people understand the significance of \nthe Aadhaar card and its role in accessing various government schemes and services. \n4. The successful acquisition of Aadhaar cards by the beneficiaries will enable them to access \nvarious government schemes and services with ease. This will help them avail themselves of \nimportant benefits and support provided by the government. \n5. The Aadhaar card helps the government to maintain accurate and updated data on tea garden \nworkers, which can be used for planning and policy formulation. \nOverall, Swaniti's efforts to link tea garden workers with different government schemes through the \ncorrection of their Aadhaar cards will help ensure that tea garden workers have access to the \navailable social protection schemes, thereby building a more inclusive and equitable society in \nWest Bengal. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n7.2.c.

These \nefforts were made in the face of significant opposition from various stakeholders (like private \nassociations, local leaders, etc.) who stood to benefit from maintaining the existing status quo, \nrather than facilitating social and financial inclusion for the dependents of tea gardens. The \nopposition that the team encountered was multifaceted and ranged from vitriolic political \ninterference sometime creating a major bottleneck in service delivery. Despite these challenges, the \nteam was able to organize Aadhaar Enrollment/ correction camps that enabled more than 1300 \ndependents to become eligible for a range of social welfare schemes.  \nLearnings: \nAs a learning strategy, Swaniti plans to onboard the district administrations of all four districts \nwhen organizing the Aadhaar camps and other interventions for a smooth flow of work processes. \nSwaniti also plans to onboard and work with the  forms of government and private ( Team \nassociations) stakeholders to reach the maximum number of garden workers through the \nintervention plan in place. \n  \n \n \n \nOak Progress Report.    5 \n \n7.3.a.

We are in the process of creating pockets of evidence that can \nwork as proof of concepts for scale up and adoption by the key decision makers. To achieve this we \nhave designed the following strategy : \nNeeds assessment: \nA thorough needs assessment was conducted to identify the specific challenges faced by tea garden \nworkers in accessing social protection schemes. That includes issues related to documentation, \naccess to information, and barriers related to caste or gender. \nStakeholder mapping and engagement: \nTea garden workers themselves, as well as community leaders, civil society organizations, and \nother Government stakeholders, were mapped to be engaged in the policy development process, \nensuring that the needs and perspectives of the aforementioned groups are considered. \nCapacity building: \nThe policy framework includes provisions for building the capacity of tea garden workers to access \nand utilize social protection schemes. This includes training on documentation and application \nprocedures, as well as outreach and awareness raising efforts to ensure that workers are aware of \ntheir rights and entitlements. \nInterdepartmental coordination: \nCoordination between different government departments and agencies being crucial for ensuring \nthe effective implementation of social protection schemes, the policy framework works to ensure \ninterdepartmental coordination and collaboration. \nMonitoring and evaluation: \nRegular monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the policy framework involving \nregular feedback from tea garden workers and other stakeholders, as well as quantitative data on \nenrollment and utilization of social protection schemes. \nGrassroots implementation: \nThe implementation of the policy framework ensures that tea garden workers are aware of the \navailable schemes and their accessibility. \n  \n \n \n \nOak Progress Report.    6 \n \n7.3.c.

Objective 1 Objective \nTo promote understanding and responsibility of employers, monitoring & regulatory bodies for \ncreation of safe workplaces that are free of sexual harassment for institutionally employed women \nespecially from resource poor background. \n \n \n \n7.1.b. Objective 1 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nSanhita, in its effort to reach out to the most marginalised women workers within the organised sector, \nchose to engage with the women of the two most important industries in the state\u2019s economy, viz, \nJute & Tea. The Jute Mills in the state employs around 25000 women workers and the number is \nconstantly increasing over the past two years. Historically, tea plantations have always been a \ntraditional employer of large number of women. Almost 61% of the 3.2 lakh workers employed in \nthe tea plantations of West Bengal are women. However, information on the safety of women workers \n(ie. sexual harassment as an aspect of working condition and welfare) is lacking in both the industries. \nIn order to create a body of evidence which would help in advocacy for safe workspaces, Sanhita \nconducted Situation Analysis in both the industries to understand the safety of women workers (in \nthe context of sexual harassment at workplace). The studies investigated the perceptions and \nprevalence of sexual harassment, the accountability of key stakeholders towards promoting safe \nworkplace for women and the implementation of 2013 Act. These reports will serve as an important \ndocument on the safety of women workers in the jute mills and tea plantations. \nThe Situation Analysis in Jute Industry was conducted in 2019 among women workers of 6 Jute Mills \nand leadership of 7 Jute Federations and 6 Jute Unions in Hooghly and North 24 Parganas districts. \nThe Situation Analysis in Tea Plantations was conducted in 2022 and covered government and non-\ngovernment stakeholders like the district administration, the Labour Department of GoWB, the tea \ngarden management, trade unions, tea associations; besides the women workers themselves from 24 \ntea gardens in two (Dooars and Terai) of the three tea growing regions. \nSome of the key findings common to both industries that have emerged from the two independent \nstudies are: \n\u2022 Lack of awareness regarding safe workplaces (including sexual harassment of women at \nworkplace (SHW), the POSH Act, 2013 and its provisions) of almost all respondents in the \njute mills & the tea gardens. \n\u2022 Compliance with the Act is marginal. \n\u2022 The issue of safe workplaces, in the context of sexual harassment, has not even been \nconsidered to be an integral component of working conditions or labour rights of women \nworkers. \nThe very large numbers of women employed in the two industries studied are vulnerable due to their \nposition at the bottom of the hierarchy, casualisation of employment, overall isolated and dependent \nwork conditions which are further compounded by poverty, low wages, migration status, domestic \nviolence and low literacy levels. \nThe government departments like the district administration (District Officer) who is responsible for \noverall implementation of 2013 Act in the respective districts or the labour department who is \nresponsible for overall welfare and rights of workers have not adopted any appropriate measures \ntowards ensuring safe workplaces for marginal women workers. \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \nSanhita has utilised the Situation Analysis findings as a tool for advocacy and intervention with \nmultiple stakeholders. The outreach to women workers has been channelled through intense and \nconsistent engagement with the Trade Unions who are directly working with them. Parallelly Sanhita \nconducted evidence-based advocacy with the employers, employers\u2019 association, Labour Department \nand District Administration for creating safe workplaces for its women workers through \nimplementation and monitoring of the 2013 Act. \nOverall Outcomes in both Industries \n\u2022 Knowledge Creation on status of safe workplaces for marginalised women workers: The \n2 Situation Analysis studies have created thus far unavailable information and evidence on \nthe safety of women workers in the jute mills and tea plantations in West Bengal. \n\u2022 Voices of Women Workers were documented and shared with relevant stakeholders: \nThe hitherto unheard voices of the underrepresented women workers in the jute mills and tea \nplantations were brought to light by Sanhita through Situation Analysis study and the \nintervention programmes. The voices served as evidence for Sanhita\u2019s dialogue and advocacy \nwith the key stakeholders like the monitoring bodies, the employers and the trade unions. \n  \n\u2022 The plight of the women workers in Jute Mills and Tea Plantations get highlighted in \nprint Media articles: During the course of dissemination of the Situation Analysis findings, \nSanhita organised 2 centralised meetings with the Jute Mill Unions and Tea Plantation Unions \nrespectively. These events and the study findings got very well covered in the media articles. \nFollowing this different groups working with marginal/unorganised workers have reached out \nto Sanhita seeking further information. The Situation Analysis report soft and hard copies \nhave been widely disseminated among these different groups and organisations. \nMajor Outcomes in Jute Industry \n\u2022 The Employers got evidence-based knowledge of the SHW issue and the implementation \nstatus of the 2013 Act: \nThe findings of the Situation Analysis were shared at all levels, the Labour Department, GoWB, \nEmployers\u2019 Association and Trade Union Leaders. In case of the Jute Industry, taking this \ninformation to Indian Jute Mill Association (IJMA) was a critical need as IJMA is an apex \norganisation representing the management of the jute mills in India.  In a scenario where reaching \nout to IJMA was proving to be a challenge, the Labour Department\u2019s timely intervention helped \nimmensely. The Labour department, which was already well acquainted with Sanhita\u2019s work, \ntook cognizance of its efforts and referred Sanhita to the Indian Jute Mill Association (IJMA). A \nseries of dialogue and interactions with the Addl. Labour Commissioner and IJMA Chairman \nresulted in the initial capacity building of member jute mills of IJMA.  Sanhita collaborated with \nIJMA for a day-long orientation for Senior profile officers representing Human Resource, \nPersonnel & Administration Departments and the Labour Officers of the Jute Mills. Further \ncapacity building for HR/ Labour Officers of the member jute mills of IJMA shall be conducted \nin collaboration with IJMA in 2023-24. \n\u2022 Recommendations for implementation of the POSH Act were acknowledged by the \nEmployers and Trade Unions:  \n\u2022 IJMA agreed to collaborate with Sanhita in this initiative. It has a total number of 35-member \njute mills, out of which 33 owned by 29 companies are located in West Bengal. Sanhita \nreceived requests from member jute mills for further capacity building of the HR of the Jute \nMills to develop systems of prevention and redress of SHW. Based on the requests Sanhita \nplans to collaborate with IJMA for conducting the Orientation Programs in 2023-24.  \n\u2022 The Trade Unions acknowledged their lack of awareness regarding the issue & the 2013 Act \nand also recognized the need to include sexual harassment free safe workplaces on their \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \nagenda and focus on rights education for women workers. This becomes more relevant in the \ncontext of gradually increasing number of women workers in the jute mills, and their proposed \nengagement in the night shift. Senior leaders of the Trade Unions agreed to collaborate with \nSanhita in conducting a series of Orientation Programmes on the rights of women workers in \nthe jute mills as laid down in the 2013 Act. Till March 2023, Sanhita had conducted 5 such \norientation programs covering 8 jutes mills in collaboration with 2 trade unions. \n\u2022 Implementation of 2013 Act becomes part of the agenda of the Trade Unions: \nFinally, as a result of Sanhita\u2019s continued dialogue and interactions with the trade union \nleaders \u2013 central & mill based, over the past four years, the issue of SHW has been included \nin the Charter of Demands of the Jute Mill Workers dated 28th January 2022. Point No 8 (b) \nof the Charter of Demands addressed to the Labour Department and the jute mill owners says: \n\u201cSeparate rest rooms, wash rooms, creche should be provided. \nLaws relating working women \"The Prohibition of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace \nAct, 2013'' must be strictly adhered to and Internal Complaint Committee should be formed as per \nlaw\" \n  \nMajor Outcomes in Tea Plantations: \n\u2022 Representative of Labour Department has expressed willingness to facilitate \nengagement with Tea Associations and Management: Through continued dialogue and \ninteraction over the past two years with the Tea Advisor to the Labour Minister, GoWB, has \nacknowledged Sanhita\u2019s work and referred Sanhita to tea associations during the Situation \nAnalysis study.  The findings of the study were shared with him and he has agreed to extend \nsupport to Sanhita and advised Sanhita to dialogue with the Labour Secretary and seek support \nduring orientation for the tea associations and management.  \n\u2022 Intervention Plan in place for taking forward the initiatives: Based on the Situation \nAnalysis findings and recommendations received on the Situation Analysis report from \ndifferent stakeholders, Sanhita has developed an Intervention Plan to reach out to The \nEmployers \u2013 tea garden owners and management, The Tea Associations, The District \nAdministration, the Labour Department, The Trade Unions and Women Workers with the \ninformation about SHW Issue, provisions of the Act, rights covered in the Act, complaint & \nredress mechanism. \n           Gaps & recommendations for implementation are acknowledged by the Trade \nUnions:  The findings of the Situation Analysis study were shared with 37 senior profile Trade \nUnion leaders, both central and garden level. It has been a challenge to             bring different \nunions together and create a synergy on the issue and needs of the women workers. With persistent \nefforts, the unions have agreed to collaborate with Sanhita in organising orientation programmes for \nwomen workers and garden level             union leaders on the issue of SHW and the Act at zonal \nlevel of Terai and Dooars region. \n \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n\u2022 There is risk on the part of the women workers to raise the issue either in small group \ninteractions or openly in any meeting as the majority of the women are casual workers and \nthere is fear of losing work if they talk about their experiences or complain against their \nsuperiors. \n \nOak Progress Report.    5 \n\u2022 Trade Unions had neither prioritised the issue of safe workplaces in the context of SHW nor \nhad any clear concept about the issue and the Act. \n\u2022 Trade Unions in West Bengal are still dominated by male leadership. Raising the issue of \nSHW in this patriarchal bastion posed a serious challenge. Sanhita developed a strategic \npartnership with a civil society organisation, Nagarik Mancha who has a long history of \nworking on labour rights issues. The partnership helped reaching out to the Trade Unions and \ncreating a positive influence among the Trade Union leadership in recognising the work of \nSanhita and the importance of the issue of SHW. \n\u2022 Major roadblock was faced in reaching out to the jute mills employers. Sanhita\u2019s long \nassociation of working with the Labour Department helped reaching out to the jute mill \nemployers through IJMA. \n\u2022 The tea gardens in the state are undergoing a massive state of turmoil. The workers are \ndemanding for land patta and implementation of Minimum Wages Act in place of Plantation \nLabour Act, which means a paradigm shift in the wage structure in the tea gardens. \n\u2022 Moreover, the political situation in the Hilly Regions is also volatile. Reaching out to the tea \nplantations workers, grassroots trade unions and the tea garden management and raising the \nissue of SHW in the hilly region posed a major challenge amidst such a situation. \n          Labour department has not included the issue of SHW and its prevention on their agenda and \nthey do not consider themselves the enforcing authority for the 2013 Act. \n \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective \nTo create access of women workers to information regarding SHW Issue & the SHWW Act \nthrough various institutions and support redress of complaints \n \n \n \n7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nSanhita has taken multiple routes to ensure that marginal women workers gain access to the \ninformation on SHW issue, the 2013 Act and their rights to a safe workplace. One of this has been \nintegral to the intervention process both during the course of conducting the Situation Analysis as \nwell through sharing the findings of the report with the women workers. The other approach has been \nthrough dissemination of stakeholder specific IEC materials which provided information both on the \nissue and the Act.  \nWomen Workers in the Jute Mills received information on the issue of SHW and the 2013 Act \n\u2022 Through a series of orientation sessions, it has been possible to directly reach out to 225 \nworkers from around 8 Jute Mills in the Hooghly and North 24 Parganas districts. 86% of the \nworkers i.e 194 were women. Strategically, some interested and active male workers were \nalso included in these orientation programmes. \n\u2022 The programmes were organised in the Muhallas of the jute mills in Gate Meeting style. \n \nOak Progress Report.    6 \n\u2022 The women workers who participated initially with trepidation have over a period of time \ngained the confidence to speak out about their own experiences in the workplace and instances \nof sexual harassment faced. \n\u2022 There has been a gradual swell of women\u2019s active participation in the meetings as well as \nwithin the unions. \n\u2022 Trade Unions collaborated with Sanhita in this initiative. They took an active role in selecting \nthe meeting venue in the vicinity of the jute mills, ensuring participation of the women \nworkers from the adjacent jute mills and arranging logistics for the programmes. \n\u2022 The meetings served as a platform for raising the awareness of the women workers on the \nissue, the Act and their rights as workers. This understanding of their rights is what is \nmotivating the women to break their silence and speak out. \nReaching out to Women Workers in the Tea Gardens \nA similar process is underway with select Tea Gardens in North Bengal wherein the findings of the \nSituation Analysis will be shared with the women workers in the plantations. This initiative has \nalready been included in the Intervention Plan for 2023-2024.  \nStakeholder specific IEC Material \nPrimer on the POSH Act, 2013 \u2013 A comprehensive document in English which presents the \nprovisions and nuances of the POSH Act, 2013 in a lucid and easy to understand format. This has \nbeen extensively shared with Employers, Employers\u2019 Associations, Internal Committees (ICs), \nNGOs & Human Rights Activists, Monitoring Bodies and the Trade Unions. The Primer is being \ndisseminated in both soft and hard copies.  \nBooklet in Bangla (\u2018Karmakhetre Jouno Henosthar Mokabilay Narikarmee\u2019) \u2013 In a scenario where \nthere was not a single material available on SHW issue and the Act in Bangla language which could \nbe read and understood by women workers Sanhita developed and printed this booklet. It not only \nexplains the issue and the Act in simple language but also gives practical information on what women \ncan do during a crisis situation. The booklet has been disseminated to marginal Women Workers and \nTrade Unions among others. \nThere has been a demand from the unions in North Bengal & the Jute Mills for the booklet to be \nprovided in Hindi and the translation has already been completed and printing in progress. \nLeaflet in 3 languages (Say No to SHW) \u2013 Printed in English, Bangla and Hindi the leaflets provide \na snapshot view of the Act viz a viz employers responsibility and women\u2019s workplace rights. This \neasy to comprehend content has been extensively circulated among women workers and other \nstakeholders. These leaflets are also available in white board animation format. \nSituation Analysis Reports \u2013 The Situation Analysis not only captures the voices of women workers \nin Jute Mills and Tea Plantations, but its findings are also being taken back to the women workers so \nthat they gain an understanding regarding the status of safety at their own workplaces. \nSanhita\u2019s footprint at the Kolkata Book Fair 2023 \u2013 Sanhita\u2019s strategic partner Nagarik Mancha\u2019s \nstall at the Kolkata Book Fair was dedicated to the issue of Marginal Women Workforce. The stall \nhad a display of all of Sanhita\u2019s IEC materials which were widely disseminated. The issue of SHW \nin the context of marginal women workers got highlighted for the first time ever at a prestigious event \nsuch as the Book Fair. \nCrisis Intervention Services \nTo support redress of complaints, Sanhita adopted multi-pronged strategies \u2013 support to aggrieved \nwomen, support to SHW Committees in dealing with complaints, identification of procedural and \nknowledge gaps in handling of SHW complaints, and understanding of barriers in effective case \nredress for strengthening the justice delivery mechanism in the capacity of external member, support \ngroup or advisor. \n \nOak Progress Report.    7 \n  \nIn the capacity of External Member \nPresently Sanhita is representing at about 14 Complaints Committees across Education Institutions, \nMedical Colleges & Hospitals, Central & State Government offices which employ a large number of \nwomen workers and/or working as Sanhita\u2019s strategic partners. These SHW Committees receive \ntechnical support at regular interval from Sanhita to deal with the complaints effectively. \nIn the past one year (April, 2022 \u2013 March, 2023) Sanhita has dealt with 5 complaints in the capacity \nof External Member in the Internal Committees (ICs) and in two cases Sanhita has played the support \nrole. 1 case has been reported in a Security Force of Central Government, 2 cases were from a Central \nGovernment organisation and 2 cases were from 2 different Medical Colleges & Hospitals.  \nAs a result of Sanhita\u2019s presence, facilitation and participation, the following outcomes were \nachieved in dealing SHW complaints in the ICs.  \nThe procedures were followed properly, the case was conclusive and aggrieved women received \njustice through the Internal Committee in the Security Force of Central Government and 2 Medical \nColleges and Hospitals. \nIn one case of the central government organisation, ICs had to take Ex-parte decision due to absence \nof complainant in three consecutive hearings and in another case, the IC has submitted report of the \npreliminary inquiry to the disciplinary authority recommending the need for final inquiry as the IC \nhas found merit in the complaint during the preliminary inquiry. \nAs a result of Sanhita\u2019s advocacy, a central government organisation employing a large number of \nwomen has launched its online complaint format on SHW. \n  \nIn the capacity of Support Group and Advisor \nIn the past one year, Sanhita also provided the technical support to the Presiding Officers, Members \nand External Members. On 10th February, 2023, Sanhita conducted a centralised training for the ICs \nfrom 9 government department/organisations, 19 non-government organisations and 8 private \norganisations through centralised training. In these committees, Sanhita does not represent as external \nmembers. \nAs a result of Sanhita\u2019s role as a support group and advisor, the following outcomes could be \nachieved. \nIn two complaints from two different eminent Universities, Sanhita provided legal advice and \ncounselling support to the aggrieved persons who approached the organisation directly. \nA group of engineering students (both female & male) lodged a mass complaint against one of the \nfaculty members to the IC of their university. The complainants also approached media houses. \nSanhita assisted the senior journalists from a renowned media house who reached out to Sanhita in \norder to understand the ethics and strategy of reporting the mass complaint on SHW. \n \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nReaching out to women workers \nThe employers are reluctant to give access to the casual, unorganised and marginal workers within \ntheir organisations. When it comes to ensuring safe workplaces for women employees, the \n \nOak Progress Report.    8 \nemployers accountability extends to only women working in offices. Though the industries are \ndependent on the women workers in their factories, mills and plantations these women don\u2019t exist \nin their policies and there is no eagerness to change the status quo of this invisibility. The only way \nfor Sanhita to access the women workers is through strategic partnerships with trade unions \nworking with them or with NGO which are either directly working with them or working with the \ncommunities that they are part of. \nIt has been rather challenging to raise the issue of sexual harassment in such public forum which is \na first of its kind experience for the mill workers. \nWorking with the Unions \nThe unions being patriarchal structures are not too keen to work with feminist/women\u2019s groups. They \nare also weary of NGOs in general and are skeptical about what results a collaboration can yield. \nSanhita\u2019s strategic partnership with Nagarik Mancha and its persistent endeavours helped in not only \nbreaking the ice with the unions but also bringing different unions together on a common platform. \nWorking closely with the unions, Sanhita was able to reach the women workers. \n  \nCrisis Intervention \nExperiences of Complainants \nAlmost all complainants have been experiencing \u2018Character assassination\u2019, \u2018humiliation\u2019 and \u2018hostile \nwork environment\u2019 irrespective of their designation, employment status & work sector. \nSanhita experiences the following concern areas in dealing SHW complaints as a support group & \nadvisor: \nChallenges in following Inquiry Procedure  \nIn most of the cases, Sanhita experienced lack of technical knowhow about inquiry procedure among \nIC members. ICs where Sanhita is not the External member were also unaware about the SHW issue. \nKnowledge Gap among Aggrieved \nSanhita noted a knowledge gap among students who approached Sanhita for legal advice and \ncounseling support. The engineering students were definitely empowered, but, were found to be \nlacking even in basic information about their rights laid down in the 2013 Act. They also did not have \nany understanding about how to deal with such harassment.  \nICs not Equipped \nIn two complaints, where Sanhita has played a support role, the ICs were not equipped enough to \nhandle the complaints. Sanhita identified the gaps in Technical knowledge, like process of inquiry, \nservice  rules of the organization, legal aspects etc and also found lacunae in documentation \nprocess. As a result of this, the aggrieved faced hostility from their ICs. \nNon-cooperative Authority /Administration \nAggrieved also faced non-cooperation from the Authority/Administration in both the education \ninstitutes. \n \n \n \n7.3.a.

Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nBeing part of the process of developing the Theory of Change for the Oaks Country Programme was \na great learning experience for Team Sanhita. It helped the team understand the gaps in the \nMonitoring, Evaluation and Learning approaches within the organisation. The proposed approach, \nstrategies and interventions in the Tea Gardens were reviewed, fine-tuned, and sharpened during the \nTOC development process. \nSanhita\u2019s Organisational ToC is in place: Following this Sanhita also developed an organisational \nTOC with the help of NIITI Consulting. This helped the team in structuring and streamlining all \naspects of the work and in clearly defining expected outputs and outcomes. Sanhita\u2019s projects have \nbecome more outcome oriented. \nSanhita has also arrived at a template for its work through which it is able to simultaneously achieve \nall the following results: \n\u2022 Reach out to women workers directly and hear their voices and concerns. \n\u2022 Implement interventions on a Pilot basis and evaluate outcomes. \n\u2022 Document outcomes, progress and learnings and disseminate it with key stakeholders as well \nas a wider audience. \n\u2022 Share all of the above and continue its evidence-based advocacy with relevant stakeholders. \nIn keeping with its commitment to expand its fund base, Sanhita had secured a second funding from \nPaul Hamlin Foundation (PHF). This project has successfully completed its first cycle of one year \nnine months following which there was an external evaluation. On the basis of the recommendations \nof the evaluation they have agreed to continue the support for another two years. Under the PHF \nsupport, Sanhita will reach out and closely work with marginal/frontline workers of Government \nDepartment on the issue of safe workplaces. This is also a first of its kind initiative. \nIn response to the increased projects, Sanhita\u2019s core team has also expanded with the addition of one \nmore member. \nCurrently efforts are underway to secure another additional funding from within the country. \nSanhita\u2019s FundRaising Strategy Paper is in place \nThe strategy paper for 2022 \u2013 2025 outlines Sanhita\u2019s Funding Needs, Strategies and Challenges to \nput the organisation on a sustainable long-term financial footing so that it will be able to deliver on \nits objective of creating safe workplaces for women workers across sectors. \nIn the financial year 2023-2024, Sanhita\u2019s total Annual Budget is INR 70 Lakhs. Considering the \norganisational capacity and the programmatic needs, Sanhita sets the maximum limit of the \norganisational annual budget i.e. INR 90 Lakhs in the coming financial years. \nSanhita has been adopted multiple strategies for fundraising such as exploring the contacts with \ninternational and national level donor agencies/organisations who would support work in the area of \nsafety of women workers, developing partnership with select government departments, private \norganisations, employers\u2019 associations, NGOs, trade unions or education institutes who are willing \nto sponsor or share costs of training  programmes and planning to collaborate with the organisations \nat national level involved in research related to women workers\u2019 issue where Sanhita can bring its \ntechnical expertise and domain knowledge of sexual harassment at workplace.  (Strategy Paper is \nattached as Annexure) \n \nOak Progress Report.    10 \nMajor Outcome \nIn the second cycle, Sanhita approached the Paul Hamlyn Foundation with an innovative and \nchallenging proposal of working directly with Anganwadi Workers in two districts of West Bengal. \nIn addition, Sanhita will do advocacy with the monitoring and relevant government departments for \ncreating safe workplaces for frontline workers. The Paul Hamlyn Foundation is supporting this new \ndomain of Sanhita\u2019s work for the next two years (April, 2023 \u2013 March, 2025).  \nIn the past one year, Sanhita has established the programme specific partnership with Department \nof Panchayat & Rural Development, Indian Jute Mill Association and an NGO named Nari O Sishu \nKalyan Kendra for different initiatives.   \n \n \n \n7.3.c.

The issue moreover is tied to workplace dynamics and the \nemployers/organisations among other stakeholders hesitate to support the cause as this \nmight lead to clash of interest  \n\u2022 Sanhita does not encourage online donation from the individuals/associations in the context \nof stringent FC & IT rules & regulations \n\u2022 Sanhita has been receiving requests to conduct training from public sector, central \ngovernment, private organisations, NGOs and state government departments. But some state \ngovernment departments and private organisations offer no or a very nominal amount of \nfacilitation fees. But for strategic reason and visibility, Sanhita accepts such offer from some \nimportant government departments. Sometimes it becomes difficult to select organisations \nand balance between the visibility & fund generation.    \n         Being a small organisation with limited human resources, it is often challenging to balance \nbetween the existing project commitments and training assignments against fees as part of the \nfundraising.  \n \n \n8.", "Significant changes": "Significant changes.

Objective 1 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nChangemakers Program in Assam: \nThe Changemakers Program was launched in Assam in April 2022 by Nazdeek\u2019s grantee partner, \nPAJHRA. The purpose was to support 14 Adivasi youth to build knowledge and capacity towards \nholistic leadership skills. They were provided 6 in-person residential trainings, 2.5 days long each, \ncovering sessions on (1) culture, history and society, (2) civic education, and (3) skills such as \nresearch, writing and reporting. Each training was followed by supervised field work in communities, \nwherein the participants conducted Focus Group Discussions, Individual structured interviews and \nsubmitted 4 reports per participant in the duration of the Program. Each of the reports were a part of \ntheir homework, which involved field work on a selected issue (such as the Public Distribution \nSystem or Anganwadi) and then preparing a report to document the activity and analyse the results. \nTo culminate the program, 08 of the fellows were taken on an Exposure Visit where they visited \nhistorical monuments and interacted with organisations such as DISHA, Durbar, and Jana Sanghati \nKendra. The idea behind the visit was to provide a chance to these Adivasi youths hailing from remote \nplantations and with limited opportunities for travel and urban exposure to learn about metropolitan \nlifestyles, Indian art and history, and to gain a wider understanding of socio-economic issues and \nCSO based interventions outside the plantations space and with demographies other than Adivasis. \nOf the 14 participants, 09 were women and 05 were men; most hailing from a social work and legal \neducation background. The syllabus, pedagogy, design and monitoring, and selection process was \ndeveloped under the guidance of subject matter experts such as Prof. Virginius Xaxa. For each \nsession, training modules (15 in total) were created. \nIn terms of the progress in achieving Objective 1, as the first in a three-year process, this Program \nwas successful. Based on the skills mapping and expectation analysis conducted with the cohort, it is \nevident that they increased, and in certain subjects acquired first time knowledge, on matters of Indian \ngovernance structure, entitlements on health, food, labour, grievance redressal systems, information \napplications, issues-stakeholder-risk analysis, desk and field research and writing. Significantly, as is \nalso reflected in the Most Significant Change stories attached herewith, they developed and \nstrengthened critical thinking, public speaking, networking and outreach skills and grew \ndemonstrably in confidence and self-respect. Motivated by the learnings, participants from the \nprogram have gone on to work as Accredited Social Healthcare Activists in tea plantations, gender \ncommittee President of tea worker women\u2019s collectives, while some are conducting independent \nresearch on Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme for tea workers, have enrolled in graduate level Labour \nEconomic courses, and have become more active as members of workers\u2019 collectives. In various \nfeedback sessions, the participants have shown a keenness to work within their community and on \nissues concerning tea workers at large in their professional or individual capacity, as feasible. \nOther Capacity Building Activities, Community Consultations, Meeting with line departments: \n \nOak Progress Report.    3 \nApproximately 34 capacity building, trainings of trainers, and community consultations were carried \nout by PAJHRA, with technical support from Nazdeek. Out of these, 04 offline and 03 online \nconsultations were held to study the new labour regime and state rules, and formal comments thereto \nwere submitted to the Labour Welfare Department, Assam. To commensurate the efforts, 07 meetings \nwere held with government line departments (E.g. District offices of National Health Mission, \nDepartment of Health & Family Welfare, Social Welfare, Gaon Panchayat and local Police Units; \nState level Directorate of Social Welfare and NHM Headquarters) on issues connected with maternal \nhealth and maternity benefits, ration, sexual harassment at workplace, tea garden hospitals by \ncommunity members and women collective\u2019s representatives. \nThe participants of the listed exercises included PAJHRA staff and volunteers, women and student \ncollective\u2019s leaders and women community members. Through this process of knowledge sharing \non entitlements, recording ongoing issues and grievances, identifying redressal strategies, and \nsharing the same with communities, PAJHRA staff, volunteers, and women collective leaders were \nnot only able to enhance their \nown understanding of entitlements and grievance redressal mechanisms (helpline numbers, postal \ncomplaints and in-person complaints submission directed primarily towards ration services, \nhealthcare including maternal and child, Anganwadi system), they were also alongside able to \nstrengthen and expand their rapport with communities. For the communities, at this stage of the \nproject, it led to an increased awareness of their entitlements, approaches and processes to access \nthem and filing grievances, and learning through direct demonstration by guided visits/helpline calls \nto authorities for filing complaints, advocacy, and seeking information from the authorities.  In \nDibrugarh for instance, PAJHRA\u2019s field educators organised community meetings with Aanganwadi \nWorkers (AWWs) and ASHA workers for pregnant and lactating women, where the latter filed their \ngrievances before the AWCs, shared their mutual challenges\u2014especially those related to \ndocumentation and form filling. As a follow up, they persuaded the ASHA to accompany them to \ntheir sub-center to review the status of their maternity cash entitlement applications as per official \nrecords, submit additional documents, and file complaints over non-payment of cash installments. \nFollowing this, of the 10 partcipants, 3 received partial instalments, 2 full instalments, and the \nremaining were able to submit necessary documents. Some of the other key impacts observed \nincluded formation of unit committees of the women\u2019s collective in Dibrugarh, Nagaon, and Golaghat \nDistricts, and initiatives taken by women community members and collective\u2019s leaders to address \ntheir grievances, especially those related to pregnant and lactating women, through meetings with \ngovernment representatives. For instance, in a community meeting held in Duliajan (Dibrugarh), 28 \nwomen community members identified inadequate food, nutrition, clothing and shelter, expensive \nand inadequate medical services, poor and inaccessible education as main issues plaguing the tea \nplantation workers. They were aided in the issue identification process by PAJHRA\u2019s field educator \nand by the local ASHA, AWWs, AWW helpers, and Auxiliary Nursing Midwife (ANM) who had \nespecially been invited as government representatives to this meeting for information exchange, \nadvocacy, and grievance resolution purposes. The community members discussed best options for \ntheir advocacy on the identified issues and decided to tackle them by way of collectives. The \ncollectives\u2019 leaders (who were also present in the meeting) explanation of the purpose, process, and \nimpact of women\u2019s collectives played an important role in this decision. They observed that \ncollectives\u2019 strength and resources were necessary to support them in elevating their grievances to \nthe government office bearers. Thus, they collectively decided to form a unit committee of the \ncollective at Duliajan Gaon Panchayat and a regional committee at Duliajan. \nScoping for local partner organisations: \nDuring the reporting period, Nazdeek engaged in scoping for partner organisations in Assam and \nhas identified 3 potential partners, including one in the Barak Valley. Owing to the prevailing \nsituation, the progress on this activity has been gradual with great emphasis on financial and legal \ndue diligence. We are also conferring with experts, current local partner organisations and \n \nOak Progress Report.    4 \ncollectives to help us identify the way forward in Assam. Nazdeek intends to complete the \nreassessment and reorientation of its Assam engagement by the end of this year. \n  \n \n \n \n7.1.c. Objective 1 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nThe current legal and policy conditions have been the primary challenge during the reporting period. \nIncreasing threats to human rights defenders have also affected the pace and depth of work. The \nsuspension of PAJHRA\u2019s FCRA certificate in October affected program activities in the last quarter \nof the project. While Nazdeek was able to ensure completion of the Changemakers program through \nanother grantee, the other remaining activity (exposure visit for women collective members) was \nwithdrawn from the project as it was considered neither prudent nor feasible to conduct the same. \nDespite the above situation, it may be noted that Nazdeek was able to accomplish all activities \ncommitted to by it in year 1 of the grant. \nWith the continued suspension of PAJHRA\u2019s FCRA certificate, Nazdeek is currently reassessing its \nstrategy in Assam, in consultation with relevant experts and the Oak Foundation. \nAt the grantee\u2019s level, a program at the scale of the Changemakers program was novel to them and \nserved as a sharp learning curve for their team. They experienced logistical and coordination \nchallenges in the initial part of the program. As expertise on certain subjects is limited within the \ncommunity, they initially struggled to identify resource persons. But with Nazdeek\u2019s technical \nguidance and support from experts based outside of Assam, they were able to overcome these issues \nduring the 2nd quarter of the project. \nEnsuring women community members\u2019 participation in community and collective activities, \nespecially in new project areas was also a challenge faced by the grantee. In order to overcome the \nsame, the grantee staff engaged in dedicated outreach and rapport building and also utilised the \nsupport of women collective\u2019s leaders. \n  \n \n \n \n7.2.a. Objective 2 Objective \nEnhance capacity of local civil society organisations in Barak Valley to bring greater access to \nsocio-economic rights to tea plantation workers (timeframe: 3 years). \n \n  \n \n \n \n7.2.b. Objective 2 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \n \nOak Progress Report.    5 \nNazdeek, as per the year one commitment, engaged in scoping for a partner in Barak Valley. We \nconducted this activity through consultations with our existing partners and networks, subject \nmatter experts, community collectives active in the region to build a list of potential partners. In \npursuance of the same, we visited an organisation in Barak Valley, interacted with their Director \nand Board Member, office staff to better understand their approach and current work. We are also \nexploring possibilities of our current partners being able to support us in activities in the Barak \nValley. Due to the ongoing situation, Nazdeek is doing careful considerations in legal and financial \ncompliances and making gradual progress on this objective. Nazdeek intends to complete the \nreassessment and reorientation of its Assam engagement by the end of this year, and this will \ninclude the finalisation of a partner for the Barak Valley part of the project, if the new engagement \nplan allows the same. \n \n \n \n7.2.c. Objective 2 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nAs mentioned earlier, the current legal and policy conditions have forced us to take a measured \napproach towards this objective in Year 1. We are following the advice of financial and legal \ncompliance experts in the matter and for now intend to continue our scoping activity in Year two. \n \n \n \n7.3.a. Objective 3 Objective \nEnhance capacity of local civil society organisations through training of trainers in West \nBengal to bring greater access to socio-economic rights to tea plantation \nworkers (timeframe: 3 years). \n \n \n \n7.3.b. Objective 3 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nAs this is Nazdeek\u2019s first grantee-based initiative in West Bengal, this Objective and especially the \nactivities in Year 1, were crafted to combine scoping and baseline studies on tea workers issues in \nNorth Bengal and a need-based training of trainers (ToT) model for the grantee. After an initial \nbaseline study (attached herewith) conducted in 9 tea plantations, focusing on issues and context \nmapping, our grantee BMJ with Nazdeek\u2019s technical support, was able to (1) identify ToT topics \nand design, (2) select Cha Sundari Scheme (a tea workers\u2019 housing scheme launched by WB \ngovernment in 2022) for field research and report writing, (3) identify line departments for \nconsultations, and (4) identify topics for filing Right to Information (RTI) applications where \nofficial guidelines and data was required for any further activities. \nBased on the above, 4 ToTs were conducted on Indian Governance and Legal structures for \nentitlements; Right to Information; Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace; and on Anti-\nGender Discrimination. The participants for these trainings included consultants associated with \ngrantee, community members, and leaders of community collectives. 4 training modules were also \n \nOak Progress Report.    6 \ndeveloped for the purpose of the ToTs. These trainings allowed for systematic knowledge sharing, \nwhich was further transferred to communities via community meetings by the participants. The \ntrainings also helped the grantee in assessing the current levels of knowledge on issues and policies \namong community leaders and members, and in further refining the project. The training \nparticipants, especially after the trainings on sexual harassment and gender discrimination, resolved \nto (a) be more vigilant of such cases in their plantations and to record and track the same, (b) \nconduct awareness exercises with the community, especially women and their families, (c) use \nstrategies such as RTI filing and engagement with plantation management and local officials over \nnon-compliance with the POSH Act. \nFurther, at least 120 community consultations were carried out by the grantee across 30 plantations. \nTopics ranged from the need to collectivize on common issues, formulating workers\u2019 claims\u2014\nespecially for gratuity and provident fund\u2014available grievance redressal mechanisms, maternity \nbenefits and entitlements, prevention of harassment at the workplace and reporting mechanisms, \netc. These consultations enhanced the workers and the communities understanding of their issues \nand how they must be understood, how to identify and utilize available resources, and a clearer \nknowledge of utilization of policies and systems pertaining to their work. \nFollowing the trainings, 5 RTIs were filed by the training participants and grantee consultants on \nthe Cha Sundari scheme. 4 meetings were conducted by the Grantee, workers collective\u2019s leaders, \nand local legal experts with relevant officials from the Housing and Labour Departments to \nunderstand the technicalities of Cha Sundari scheme and the progress in drafting of rules to the new \nlabour codes by the West Bengal government. The RTI responses and information received through \nmeetings contributed in the development of the Cha Sundari Report that was launched in \nJanuary 2023. This report is to be utilized for generating scheme related awareness among \ncommunity members and to help them draft and establish claims thereunder. As the report states, \nthere is ambiguity at the policy level for this scheme and the grantee intends to engage with the \nrelevant authorities to clarify the same and advocate for changes where required. \nFurther, as an impact of the meetings with the line departments, the grantee was invited to prepare \ndraft rules on labour codes and submit the same to them in order to support the government\u2019s own \ndrafting process. With technical support from Nazdeek, the grantee developed and submitted draft \nrules on (1) Industrial Relations Code and the Occupational Safety, Health, and Working \nConditions Code and (2) a summary of on the remaining two codes and (3) state amendment \nrecommendations for all 04 codes. These were submitted to the Office of the Deputy Labour \nCommissioner, Alipurduar. In year two, the grantee intends to continue engagement with the \ngovernment departments in the drafting and finalization of these rules which will have a wide-\nranging impact on tea workers\u2019 status and entitlements.   \n \n \n \n7.3.c. Objective 3 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nThe challenges faced during Year 01 were: \n1. Difficulty in maintaining a steady and consistent cohort. The remoteness of the \nplantations, limited transport options, and the loss of a day\u2019s wage for participants in order to \nattend the trainings posed a challenge for the grantee. This was especially an obstacle in \nparticipation of women. As a consequence, most trainings had to be held on weekends and \nintensive planning had to be undertaken for arranging the logistics and ensuring attendance. \nFor the Year two, a process similar to Changemakers\u2019 program is being considered to maintain \nconsistency of participation.    \n \nOak Progress Report.    7 \n2.

As the project area and head office of the grantee were \nnot close and the latter itself was based in a small town, it became a challenge for the staff \nand consultants to coordinate on financial matters, for example submission of bills and \nreceipts had to be undertaken manually and the regularity of the same was affected. Owing to \nthis challenge, it was decided by Nazdeek to identify a more suitable grantee. Thus, Durbar \nhas been selected and we are currently conducting its financial due diligence.    \n \n \n \n7.4.a. Objective 4 Objective \nEnhance national-level advocacy on labour laws and business and human rights (timeframe: \n3 years). \n \n \n \n7.4.b. Objective 4 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nIn year 01 of the grant period, Nazdeek facilitated three consultations on draft rules to the four labour \ncodes, as issued by the Assam government. Representatives of Assam tea workers, civil society \norganisations, student and women\u2019s collectives participated in these discussions. This activity was \nundertaken under the aegis of the Assam chapter of the Forum for Rights of Tea Workers and \ncomments to all 04 draft rules were submitted. As the draft rules published by the Assam government \nwere not given wide publicity and the deadline for comments submission was unlawfully short, this \ngroup, in a meeting with the Principal Secretary, Labour Department sought an extension of the \ndeadline and also translation of the same into Assamese (official language of Assam) to ensure \nwidespread accessibility. As an impact of the meeting, the deadline for the submission of the \ncomments was extended by almost 2 months. \nAt the national level, Nazdeek provided strategic and technical support to its West Bengal grantee in \ntheir advocacy in favour of workers\u2019 claims before Justice Sapre Committee. This is a one-man \ncommittee instituted by the Supreme Court of India to assess claims for workers\u2019 dues in closed and \nsick tea plantations in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. Through our network, we \nsupported the grantee in connecting with workers and petitioners in Assam, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu \nand in assessing the ground realities. This was especially the case between our West Bengal and \nTamil Nadu partners, and our Assam and West Bengal partners who were able to meet and discuss \nstrategies towards collaborative advocacy for the coming years. The impact of these activities is \nvisible in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent order directing payment of Rs. 650 crores to 25 tea plantations\u2019 \nworkers in Assam as their legal and rightful dues, where partnerships between our grantees/partners \nplayed a crucial role in securing the workers\u2019 claims.         \n \n \n \n7.4.c. Objective 4 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \n \nOak Progress Report.    8 \nThe main challenge to attaining this objective has been the legal and policy climate around tea \nindustry and consequent impact on the civil society spaces. We and our partners are making careful \nconsiderations to work in full compliance with the laws of the land. \nThe delay in the enforcement of the new central codes, and in the formulation of rules thereunder by \nthe central and state governments has also affected our plans of national-level legislative advocacy. \nIrrespective, all our grantees and partners are in the meantime dedicated to ensuring that vast majority \nof our communities have an understanding of these laws and their implications, so that we are able \nto ensure their participation in the legislative drafting process once it resumes. We continue to seek \ncommon ground and initiatives for the fulfillment of this grant objective on other issues as well. \n \n \n \n7.5.a. Objective 5 Objective \nStrengthen civil society in the regional and global tea sectors (timeframe: 3 years). \n \n  \n \n \n \n7.5.b. Objective 5 Progress. \nWhat progress has been made toward the above grant objective(s) over the last grant period?  Please focus your response on \nprogress against desired outcomes or changes that occurred because of the activities; do not only describe what activities \noccurred or products of these efforts (i.e., Training manuals; policy briefs, etc).  \nDuring year 01 of the grant period, Nazdeek conducted 3 scoping visits within South Asia, with 01 \neach in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The purpose of these visits was to meet with potential \npartners, understand their work and our mutual synergies, as well as to conduct initial scoping visits \nin tea plantations to acquaint ourselves with country-specific contexts and status of tea workers within \nthe industry and the legal regime. In each of these countries, we also met workers and their \nrepresentatives and received information on the current collective bargaining norms and processes in \nplace. In Nepal, we conducted meetings with 3 organisations (2 in Kathmandu, 1 in Jhapa) and visted \n3 tea plantations; in Bangladesh, we met with 2 organisations, one of whom is an existing grantee, \nand visited 3 tea plantations; in Sri Lanka, we met with 2 organisations and visited 2 tea plantations. \nAt this stage, in Bangladesh we have identified a partner organisation and are in the process of \nassessing others in Nepal and Sri Lanka. \nIn order to strengthen intra-regional understanding, cooperation, and development of a common \ndemand of tea workers, their representatives and concerned CSOs, the inaugural session of the South \nAsia chapter of Forum for Rights of Tea Workers (FRTW-SA) was organised in Sri Lanka on May \n21, 2023. The participants hailed from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia (observer). \nThe day-long discussion saw the participants provide updates on the most pressing workers\u2019 issues \nin their regions and identified common factors and impacts at an intra-regional level. The issues \nidentified were non-fixation of minim wages and dilution of collective bargain power within the \nregion, the increasing informalization of the tea work with the rise of small tea growers, women\u2019s \nsocio-economic status and low representation despite being the majority tea workers, and lack of \nhousing title for tea workers across the region. The participants, as next steps, agreed to have (1) a \n2nd session of FRTW-SA early next year to discuss coalition structure and standard; (2) engage in \nbilateral collaborations and comparative studies on tea workers and entitlements to enhance mutual \nunderstanding and areas of cooperation. Further, the participants were also able to attend the \nMalaiyagam event commemorating 200 years of tea and migration/employment of Tamil workers in \n \nOak Progress Report.    9 \nup-country plantations in Sri Lanka. This event served as an opportunity for us to gain a deeper \nunderstanding of the challenges and aspirations of the tea workers community in Sri Lanka and \nallowed us to meet their representatives and relevant experts. We were also able to contribute to the \ndrafting of the final Declaration of the Malaiyagam, especially on points of women workers\u2019 \nentitlements, housing and land, and on collective bargaining processes. \n \n \n \n7.5.c. Objective 5 Challenges and obstacles. \nWe expect that the work toward grant objectives may not occur as originally planned due to internal and external factors.  \nPlease share a candid assessment of areas of challenge and learning and whether any adjustments were made. \nThe primary challenges faced were: \n1. In Nepal, as our desk and field research revealed, there are no organisations helmed by \nworkers or otherwise, that are working specifically and directly on the entitlements of tea \nworkers. There are unions that are active but they carry strong political party affiliations. \nKeeping the above in mind, we are looking to first develop knowledge partnerships with \norganisations that work on socio-economic issues with similar demographies and build \nrapport with workers\u2019 representatives, especially women. \n2. The organisation of FRTW-SA posed unique challenges in terms of legal technicalities and \nlogistics in a foreign country. We had to spend considerable organisational time and effort in \nunderstanding the legal complexities involved and in arranging travel partners for logistical \npurposes. \n \n \n8.", "Significant changes": "Significant changes. If applicable and not addressed in the challenges and obstacles question for a particular \nobjective, please state any changes that occurred over the last grant period affecting grant terms and goal delivery (i.e., key \nstaffing, leadership, timeline or organisational structural changes).   \n* Please note that financial-oriented updates (i.e., actual funding received, funding spend-down changes) should be \ncommented on within the Oak Budget to Actuals Report. \nThis reporting period has been challenging for a number of reasons. Some of them are as follows: \n\u2022 Political, Legislative, and Civil Challenges: Due to the ongoing political, legislative, and \ncivil instability within the country, we and our partners have been experiencing heightened \npressures and have had to scale back on work to address the current challenges. While \ncontinuing to support projects and grantee organizations, we have in the last few months \nfocused towards strengthening our communication and data policies, revamping and updating \nour data security systems, and collaborating with area experts to ensure security of our \nconsultants and partners. Due to the probable risks being faced by community-led \norganizations that are associated in different capacities, we are undertaking new ways of doing \nour work to ensure the safety of all parties involved. \n\u2022 Organizational Restructuring: In light of the current circumstances and long-term goals of \nthe organization, Nazdeek has chosen to undergo a phase of organizational restructuring. We \nhave been undertaking workshops, sessions, and consultations on issues related to \nsafeguarding, risk mitigation, communications strategy, and much more. As the organization \nand the consultants work through this transition, including introduction of new consultants, \neveryone is learning to adapt to the new systems and methods of work. Despite these \nchallenges, Nazdeek is looking forward to this year as we embark on more scoping visits, \nsupport grantees in conducting robust workshops, and provide enhanced technical and \nresearch advisory for grantees and communities to utilize. It is expected that this transitional \n \nOak Progress Report.    10 \nphase will come to a successful closure this year and the organization will be able to continue \nits work even more impactfully through its new form. \n\u2022 Grantee Change for Cycle 2 of the Grant: it was observed by Nazdeek that the distance \nbetween project areas and the grantee\u2019s headquarters had led to accounting, coordination, and \nreporting challenges for the grantee and its field workers under the project. Thus, Nazdeek \nrequested for a change of grantee from Bolpur Manab Jameen to Durbar Mahila Samanwaya \nCommittee. As Nazdeek had had the opportunity to meet with Durbar\u2019s leadership and staff \nand to understand their work, and also had the experience of working with them as a funder \nfor a short grant, Durbar was selected as the grantee for West Bengal leg of the project in \nCycle 2 of the grant. This change was also requested to the Oak Foundation and was approved \nby them. At this point, Durbar\u2019s financial due diligence has been completed and we have \nreceived our CA\u2019s approval to go ahead with the organisation as a grantee. \n\u2022 No-cost extensions: Nazdeek had sought and received 2 no-cost extensions from the Oak \nFoundation. The first was to complete the final remaining activity under the Assam leg of the \nproject, for conducting financial due-diligence of Durbar, and for Nazdeek\u2019s audit to be \ncompleted. As the auditors in US were not able to complete the process, we had to seek \nanother no-cost extension. \n \n \n9. Additional question(s): Please use this space to respond to any question(s) sent to you by the Oak programme team.  \nIf none were received, please leave this section blank. \nThe key focus areas for year 2 with indicative milestones are: \n1. Enhance knowledge and skills of participants from tea workers\u2019 community in West Bengal \non issues identified in the baseline study and during the first year of project by engaging them \nin structured training programs so as to develop them into a cohort of at least 6 paralegal \nvolunteers. \n2.

Village Coordination Groups (VCGs) are formed with the existing Government committee (PRI, SHG, Mothers committee, ASHA workers, school management committee etc.) members to make the institutions effective and avail government schemes and entitlements. There\u2019s no overlap of members between TFSCs and VCGs. Though, it was proposed to establish 25 TFSCs in each village but in some villages the habitations were too far from the main village (more than 3 kms.) and it was decided to have additional TFSCs. So, 28 TFSCs were formed. Total 123 monthly TFSC meetings have been conducted as on August 2023 to discuss about the issues pertaining to agriculture and livelihoods in their respective habitations. \nSimilarly, to avail government schemes and entitlements, Village Coordination Groups (VCGs) are formed in 37 habitations spread across Bankura and North 24 Parganas. Out of 89 VCG members in Sandheshkhali \u2013 1, 68 members are female and in Ranibandh, 76 members are female out of 250 total VCG members. \nThrough VCGs, awareness meetings and orientations were organized on various existing government schemes like Kanyashree, Rupashree, Swasthya Sathi and Krishak Bandhu, among others. During these meetings, VCG members/community members are also trained on how to file petitions for both individual as well as community needs.  \nThe efforts of our VCG members and field staff have resulted in sanctioning of 15 individual entitlements (ST certificate) out of total 266 petitions submitted to Boyarmari \u2013 I Gram Panchayat under Sandeshkhali \u2013 I Block, North 24 Parganas. In Ranibandh, 118 (individual as well as community) petitions are submitted to Duare Sarkar and the petitions are yet to be sanctioned.", "Project Objective 2: Promoting agro-ecological practices, crop diversification and water resource development for food & nutritional security": ".\nEstablishment of Demo-Plots\nTo promote agro-ecological practices amongst the farmers of Ranibandh block, 33 demo-plots are established out of which 24 are in Barikul GP and the rest are in Ranibandh GP. Out of 33 demo plots, 24 demo plots are established to promote vegetable crops such as cauliflower, pumpkin, cabbage, radish, tomato, bitter gourd, ridge gourd, bean etc. by following agro-ecological practices. Demo plots are owned by the farmers and are in the range of 1 \u2013 1.5 bighas of land. The demo plots are our farmer field schools (FFS) where the progressive/interested farmers are brought for exposure and training on the agro-ecological practices. 9 plots were established to demonstrate the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) method.\nTable: Details of Farmer Field Schools (FFS) conducted \n\nTotal 45 FFS are conducted in our project location under Ranibandh block, out of which 13 FFS were conducted under Ranibandh GP and 32 FFS under Barikul GP. Total 518 farmers including 53 women farmers have attended the FFS where the farmers are trained on different package of practices (POPs) for crops. \nThrough FFS, the farmers are also trained on preparing organic pesticides and fertilisers, land preparation, seed treatment, seed sowing techniques, weed control and pest management. FFS is an avenue to learn new knowledge related to agriculture that involves participatory process where farmers learn by doing under the able guidance of our field staff and experts. Liaising with PRIs and other line departments are done through regular sharing of information and meetings. The team members sought the advice of ADA on pest management in pumpkin and also on availing seeds. As the department is distributing only high yielding seeds and not indigenous, they were procured from outside. \nAgriculture Implements\nTable: Agriculture Implement Given to TFSCs in Ranibandh\n\nFarmers to ease the burden and reduce the time spent on threshing wanted to procure paddle paddy thresher, weeder and battery sprayer to increase the productivity. TFSCs procured Paddle Paddy Thresher (28), Cono Weeder (28), Battery Sprayer (6 and the remaining TFSCs will be provided soon) and Drums (56).  \nPromotion of Pulses, Oilseeds and Vegetables \nDuring the Kharif season, 619 farmers received vegetable seed (cabbage, pumpkin, okra, horse gram, tomato etc.) support as part of promoting vegetables amongst the tribal farmers\nSimilarly, during the Rabi season, 26 farmers received mustard seeds of 1 kg on an average out of which the total mustard seed production was 597 kgs. Further, 59 farmers received support to promote kitchen garden. \nThe farmers use high yielding variety of seeds in paddy and indigenous seeds for other crops. The shift to natural farming is a gradual process and so the gradation of change process is followed in CPF. In the initial phase, with few agro-ecological practices are promoted. Farmers are trained and encouraged to apply organic fertilizers (Ghanjeevamritam and Jeevamritam) and organic pesticides (Neemastram and Agniastram). The farmers treat the seeds before sowing by following the process of Beejamritam. \nCapacitating Maintenance of Watershed Structures \nThough the area receives good rainfall, the water is not being retained as the watershed structures constructed by government are not functional. So, the farmers are being given trainings on the maintenance of watershed structures. \n13 watershed structures were identified for repair and maintenance. 1 water tank was desilted in Parashiya village (Barikul GP) with the project cost of Rs.1.38 lakh and farmers contribution were Rs. 12,000. Around, 180 farmers did Shramdan for 5 days. CPFs intervention had a ripple effect and the communities desilted another tank on their own. Further, they also repaired a check dam by contributing Rs.12000/-. \nSoil Test \nTo introduce the scientific method of understanding the soil, the farmers were trained on undertaking soil tests. Soil samples were sent for testing to KVK Sonamukhi, Bankura. In the first batch, soil samples of 121 farmers were sent and the result indicated that most of the soil contains high acidic content. The results and recommendations are shared with the farmers to improve the soil health. For instance, if the NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium) content is low, the farmers are advised to increase the NPK by applying vermicompost, farm yard manure and green manure.  \nAnother batch of 107 Soil samples have been collected from the farmers and sent for testing. The results are yet to come.", "Project Objective 3: Enhancing access to alternative livelihoods among landless, resource poor and other forest dependent communities": ".\nAs majority of the communities (70%) are dependent upon Non-Timber Forest Produces (NTFPs) for additional incomes, it is imperative that the communities are made aware about the importance of forest and their conservation. Towards this end, CPF has conducted 5 trainings on sustainable harvesting of NTFPs and value addition. \n\nLocal experts and forest department officials were involved as resource persons to provide awareness to the NTFP collectors of our project villages. NTFP collectors were informed about the negative impacts of over harvesting of NTFPs and the need for value addition (leaf plate making, pickles etc.) to fetch more incomes. As far as marketing of the NTFPs are concerned, the project staff has explored different options by speaking and consulting number of persons/organizations such as the DFO of Bankura South Division, Ranibandh Range Officer, PRADAN, traders and NTFP collectors themselves. Two of our community field facilitators (CFFs) were trained on leaflet making and are aware of markets linkages. So, CPF is exploring to reestablish the market linkages through them and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in each GP under Ranibandh Block for the marketing of NTFPs. As suggested, TRIFED option also will be explored. \nTo enhance the income of landless, resource poor and single headed households, backyard poultry farming has been promoted. 42 community members from Ranibandh and Barikul were provided with poultry of local breed (3 each). \nAwareness meetings on Forest Rights Act (FRA-2006) are being conducted at the village level to make them aware about the Community Forest Rights (CFR) and the claim process. CPF has built rapport and collaborated with the Forest Department in plantation and value addition of NTFPs. The SDLC through Block Land Records Office (BLRO)/BDO has distributed IFR titles few years ago but in our operational areas no CFR titles have been submitted. The West Bengal Tribal Development Portal mentions that in Bankura district 210 CFRs have been distributed (https://adibasikalyan.gov.in/forest-right-act ) and we are trying to know where these titles are given. In the next year, we are planning to submit CFR claims in our villages after the formation of Forest Rights Committees (FRCs).", "Project Objective 4: Enabling project communities to access and avail their constitutional rights and entitlements": ".\nDuring the VCG meetings (as highlighted in the 1st Objective), project communities are made aware about the existing Government services and entitlements. To build rapport between the community and the government representatives, various programs and meetings are held. The World Environment Day was celebrated at Chendhapathar village on June 5th 2023 which was participated by forest officials, local intellectuals, school children and other community members. \n\nIn collaboration with the forest department, plant saplings are distributed amongst the project communities. Plantations were carried out by TFSC members in school compounds, ICDS centres, Dam/pond bund at Parashya and few at individual agricultural plots. \n\n\n\nChallenges\nIn West Bengal, the government officials are not accepting filing of petitions on a regular basis for social security programs and entitlements and they are only accepting during the Duare Sarkar camps and they are also not being held regularly.  We have approached the Right to Food and Work Network (RTFWN) and planning to meet them at the earliest. \nIn Sandeshkhali area, the bureaucratic hurdles in getting permission to operate in villages has taken considerable time and energy. However, now in all the 12 villages, we got permission to operate.    \nIt took some time to ground the project but with persons having agriculture qualifications and experience has helped in grounding the project at faster pace. \nThis Kharif season, due to prolonged dry spell coupled with extreme heat, the vegetable crops in few villages got damaged."}}
