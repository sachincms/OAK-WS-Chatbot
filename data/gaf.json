Context (The context section should not exceed two pages.)\n6a. Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, \ngovernance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nThere is much discrimination in our society based on economic condition, gender, \ncaste, age, educational qualification etc. We believe that being treated equally \nwith dignity is the basic thing one should expect from the society. With a vision of \na transformed society built on equity, dignity and peace Rupantaran Foundation \nwas formed in 2009 as not for profit, non-political organization. The word \n\u2018Rupantaran\u2019 literally means \u2018the process of positive transformation\u2019. As our name \nsuggests we are facilitating an empowering process of transformation towards \nequality, dignity and peace with the disadvantaged people to shape a just, \nequitable and nonviolent world. \nPresently we are directly operating in 4 blocks of Sunderbans in South 24 \nParganas district and Kolkata in West Bengal on the issues of child protection, \ngender equity, education, and livelihoods. Our aim is to build leadership, enable \nsocial justice and promote responsive citizenship among communities through \nengaging young people, women and marginalized people. Rupantaran also works \nas a resource and capacity building organisation for social partners and institutes.\n \nRupantaran Foundation is registered as a Society under West Bengal Societies \nRegistration Act XII of 1860, bearing Registration Number S/1L/60699 of 2009 \u2013 \n10. The Society is governed by a Governing Body comprising 8 members: Ms \nShruti Kundu (President), Mr Himangshu Das (Vice President)  Mr Abhishek \n(Secretary), Ms Debjani Barman (Assistant Secretary), Mr Snehasish Sarkar \n(Treasurer), Mr Gajendra Kumar (Member), Ms Jayati Mal (Member) and Ms \nUrmita Ghosh (Member). \n \nDirector Ms Smita Sen is currently leading Rupantaran. The organization has \nProgram Coordinator, Supervisor, Field Worker along with a considerable number \nof paid volunteers.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20135\n6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\nThe financial situation of Rupantaran Foundation has been on a growing curve \nwith every passing year, especially after receiving the FCRA registration.  In \nprevious year, the annual operating costs of the organization was around 67 lakhs \nand this financial year its expected to reach 1 crore.\n \nRupantaran Foundation is grassroots implementing organisation as well as it \nserves as resource organisation. One of Rupantaran\u2019s modes of raising funds for \nits programme initiatives are to provide knowledge services to likeminded \norganizations operating in the development sector.\nAlong with that Rupantaran Foundation has good individual donors base which \nserves as a backbone and cope with shock in any sudden change in funding \ncontext e.g. recent FCRA amendment. Also, Rupantaran is supported by few \nindividuals who have provided us with Corpus Fund which will act as a reserve for \nmaintaining its core program and team. As on date, Rupantaran Foundation \ndoesn\u2019t have any outstanding debts.\n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nDespite representing a large proportion of the population, adolescent and youth are \nwidely excluded from the decision making process, as they have limited access to \ninformation, space and opportunity to acquire and share knowledge, and limited \nparticipation. In this light, Rupantaran Foundation has started its journey in 2009 \naims to create a safe space, where marginalization cease to exist, and adolescent \nand youth can build their own agency and voice their opinion. We started our \njourney from a single village in Sundarbans. Through participatory vulnerability and \ncapacities analysis and micro plan with the youth, the need for working on \neducation, prevention of early marriage and child labour etc. were pointed out as \nthe menace to be fought against. In that time, our team along with those youth \ndesigned and shaped the initial programmes of Rupantaran. Gradually, along with \nyoung people we started engaging with women and other marginalized communities \nand activating government delivery mechanisms and bodies.\n \nPast Achievements:\n\u2022Two of our youth collective members from remote villages from South 24 \nParganas received the Bravery Award, 2020 from West Bengal Commission \nfor Protection of Child Rights for their extraordinary community \ndevelopment work during pandemic.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\n \n\u2022In one of the panchayat where we did our pilot work with VLCPCs, the \nVLCPCs over the period of 3 years addressed 11 cases of trafficking, 200 \ncases of child marriage, 97 cases of dropout prevention and 70 cases of \ngender based violence (including eve teasing).\n \nA sample of 220 adolescents and youth with whom we worked reached out to 11818 \npeers, 3652 family members and 3527 community members on awareness on Child \nMarriage, Trafficking, Reproductive Health Rights, Gender equity, Education and \nOnline Safety.\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nRupantaran\u2019s key strategies are:\n1) Collectivisation and creating safe spaces for the marginalised\n2) Strengthening the local governance  \n \nWe believe that collectivizing or bringing together the marginalized people in a \nsafe space enable them to articulate their oppression and strategize for individual \nand social change. In rural areas, especially in Sundarbans there is a crunch of \nspace to engage the marginalised people in the social development processes as \nthe politics of spaces significantly plays its role in allowing and rejecting dialogues \nand discussions. For us at Rupantaran, creation of safe space was not about \ncreating a physical space rather, creating a socio-cultural and psychological space \nwhere marginalization would cease to exist, celebrates a bond of trust, encourages \nbuilding their own agency and facilitating a platform for a transformative journey \nfrom self to society.\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nThe development landscape of backward areas such as the Sundarbans points at a \nglaring dearth of people-centred processes and sustainable initiatives of change. \nWhile a number of development interventions are being implemented in the \nSundarbans, the relative degrees of participation and leadership of local \ncommunities, especially those hailing from vulnerable sections, appears to be low. \nThere seems a significant scope for assimilation of an agenda for nurturance of \npeople-centred agencies of change, for greater sustainability of interventions and \nempowerment of people\u2019s agencies.\n \nThe proposed intervention aims at addressing the non-availability of a facilitative \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nplatform for vulnerable people in the Sundarbans to come together, diagnose their \nvulnerabilities and act upon the same. Such a platform has been elusive on \naccount of high opportunity cost of participation of vulnerable groups in processes \nof development, lack of any favourable prior experiences, and increasing alienation \nfrom their core habitat and livelihoods.\n \nThe proposed thrust of the intervention, i.e. creating enabling conditions for \nspecific groups of vulnerable people in the Sundarbans to assess and act upon \ntheir vulnerabilities, is likely to pose multiple challenges to facilitating agencies. \nThe challenges were identified through the participatory vulnerabilities and \ncapacities analysis along with micro plan. This includes related to mobilisation of \nvulnerable groups amidst their day-to-day struggles, finding acceptance within the \ncommunity for a slow process of change, and potential resistance on the part of \npowerful vested interests. Internally, these include the challenge of restraint \nneeded on the part of facilitating agencies, especially at the frontline level, in \norder that they do not pre-determine the directions of the process and allow the \nsame to emerge naturally from the community level processes and perspectives of \nvulnerable groups. Other challenges relate to probable gaps in understanding and \ncommitment needed to a rights-based community-led approach to development, or \nprobable non-availability of necessary skills of facilitation at the frontline level, \namong others. \n \nThe proposed intervention offers a great opportunity for strategic leveraging of \navailable strengths of other identified organizations, towards creation of pathways \nfor emergence of people\u2019s agency for sustainable change.", "7.

The HQ Operations department has \nbeen restructured into 4 portfolios: Africa, MENA, Asia-South America-Europe and \nFAST (dedicated to humanitarian crisis). This new organization supports project \nimplementation in a more efficient way, without changing roles and \nresponsibilities at country level.

Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nIndia has 450 million internal migrants (2011 census), an increase of 45% since \n2001. Of this, 68% are women. A study[1] conducted by Association for \nStimulating Know-how showed that West Bengal and Jharkhand are among the \nstates from where women migrate for work in high numbers. Children migrate \neither alone or with their family to work. While migration does not necessarily lead \nto trafficking, it creates conditions which make migrating women and children \nmore vulnerable to being traf?cked for sexual exploitation/labour.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these vulnerabilities, putting children \nand young people at increased risk of trafficking and exploitation.\nArriving at a new place, the survivors are cut off from the outside world and forced \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nto live in prison-like conditions by their captors. Documents of identification and \nmoney are immediately seized, and their movements restricted and continuously \nmonitored. Repeated violence triggers suicidal tendencies and trauma in many \nsurvivors. Rescue typically occurs through police raids, help from clients, or \ncaptors releasing the survivors due to age, health conditions, etc. However, their \ntrauma does not end with withdrawal.\nWhat follows is a chaotic and unprepared journey, into an extremely challenging \nprocess of reintegration. Survivors suffer constant terror, guilt, shame and \nhopelessness. Unaware of service providers and bereft of a social support system, \nsurvivors lack adequate occupational skills to begin anew, feel too weak to voice \ntheir concerns and consequently, find it impossible to reintegrate into their own \nsociety.\nThe study conducted by Tdh highlights survivors\u2019 experiences of stigma and the \nhardships they face upon return to their communities, that are major barriers to \ntheir successful reintegration.  Continued stigma, denial, rejection in their own \ncommunities and lack of preparedness of family members to handle the social \nstigma leave them feeling crippled and isolated.\nTdh has been successfully implementing the Learning Grant supported by Oak \nFoundation since 2013 and is currently in Phase II of the grant that concludes in \nOctober 2020. The grant has supported 35 partners to strengthen their existing \npractices of working with survivors and support their mental health and wellbeing. \nIt has also supported development of child centric participatory tools (BECOME, \nEMpowerPLus, Livelihood Precondition) and Counselling Handbook to support \nfrontline workers carrying out the reintegration process.\n44 social workers have been trained on mental health and counselling that has \nincreased their self-confidence and helped them build a trust-based relationship \nwith children.  In 2019, 1124 children were cared for individually, 445 children \nwere supported to receive services and 6508 family members were counselled and \nassisted. 1,933 stakeholders were reached through meetings, workshops and \nconsultation including village and block level child protection committees (VL/BL \nCPCs), Panchayats and Self-Help Groups. The project has engaged with 91 \nVLCPCs for providing support to children and young people.\nPartners have been supported to take up joint advocacy initiatives on the gaps in \nservices.\nUsing the seed grant from Tdh, JLKP was able to support 30 young girls and 45 \nwomen vulnerable to trafficking earn livelihood through making and selling sal \nleaf plates, in an initiative supported by the Pradhan and other villagers. This has \nimmensely enhanced the confidence and self-esteem of the girls whose average \nmonthly family income is now between Rs. 6000-7500. With the money earned \nfrom selling the plates, some women have also initiated poultry farming and \npiggeries.  Villagers have also been connected to government schemes such as the \nJharkhand Tribal Agency.\nUsing the BECOME and Livelihoods pre-condition tools, GGBK staff are now able \nto help survivors identify livelihood options and in the last two years, 46 out of 52 \ngirls receiving livelihood support are earning an income and slowly increasing \nprofits.\n[1] https://www.verite.org/ask-indias-migration-initiatives/", "7.

(600 words):\nThe project aims to promote inclusive social change by amplifying the voices \nof tribal households in 8 villages in the SBR region of the North and South \n24 Parganas and representing them in research, governance and development \ninterventions. In 4 phases, it aims to (1) enable communities in identifying \ntheir vulnerabilities and development needs and aspirations, and assess their \nOak Application Form     8\nvulnerabilities and climate risks, (2) develop community-led interventions to \naddress those needs and aspirations and reduce vulnerabilities to climate \nchange, and (3) implement these interventions through women-led processes, \nfacilitated by like-minded organizations, (4) assess the effectiveness of the \ninterventions and disseminate the knowledge gained with relevant actors.\nCore Problem: Tribal communities are specifically vulnerable to the effects \nof climate change and have limited assistance to adapt to climate change.\nAccording to researchers from Jadavpur University, the majority of the over \n200,000 tribal people in the SBR remain the most resource-poor and \nvulnerable, inhabiting forest fringe areas characterized by high hazard risks. \nPredominantly landless and ecosystem-dependent, the tribal households have \nlow adaptive capacity. Efforts to uplift tribal communities in the SBR are \nunderwhelming, with limited research on their situation and needs and few to \nno interventions support them adapt to climate change.\n \nUnderlying Problem 1: Needs of tribal communities are unknown and \nunaddressed as they are not represented in research, policy, governance and \nleadership.\nDespite the existence of several pro-tribal policies in India, tribal communities \nremain largely socioeconomically marginalized and poorly represented in \nresearch, policy and governance. Several lacunae in policymaking, such as the \nmandate that the tribal population of a location/region must be at least 50,000 \nor 50% of the total population to qualify for pro-tribal schemes and \ninterventions, exclude and further disempower these communities in the SBR, \nwhere the tribal population is non-dominant and dispersed. With low levels of \nparticipation and leadership, their development needs remain largely \nunknown and unaddressed.\n \nUnderlying Problem 2: Tribal communities have limited or no access to \ninterventions and initiatives to reduce their vulnerability to climate change. \nDue to the lack of alternatives they often rely on indiscriminate exploitation of \nnatural resources and lack sustainable resource management.\nBeing predominantly ecosystem-dependent and non-agrarian, with little to no \nlandholding, makes a significant contribution to the disempowerment of tribal \ncommunities, exposing them to man-animal conflict, denial of forest access, \nand forced migration to urban areas for contractual labour. The loss of \nlivelihood due to natural disasters and lack of sustainable management of \nnatural resources are the main drivers of negative coping strategies adopted \nby the tribal communities. The consequences of these are emissions from \ndeforested mangrove forests and blue carbon loss, decline of fish, crabs and \nshrimps, food insecurity and increase of human-animal conflicts. Though the \nSBR has been globally identified as a key climate change and biodiversity, \nclimate change adaptation for the local communities have been slow and \nunsustainable, owing primarily to the absence of community-centred \napproaches and failure to develop sustainable initiatives which are both locally \nrelevant and accessible. From their previous experience of working for the \ndevelopment and protection of vulnerable rural communities in the SBR, both \nDRCSC and LRRM have noted a dearth of development programs and \ninterventions with a special focus on tribal communities.\nOak Application Form     9\n \nUnderlying Problem 3: Tribal women are specifically marginalized, experience \ngender inequality and often face domestic abuse, neglect and deprivation, with \nno access to mental health care.\nThe disproportionate burden on tribal women remains unaddressed as they \nare severely marginalized by the existing vulnerabilities, climate-related \nstresses and gender inequality. They often assume the role of de facto \nhousehold head in the absence of migrant men, carry overwhelming \nproportions of care work, while also experiencing domestic abuse, neglect \nand deprivation. Women and children in the SBR have no recourse to formal \nmental health support.", "6. PLACE HOLDER": "6. PLACE HOLDER", "7. OBJECTIVES": "7. OBJECTIVES\nThis is the most important part of your application, as it is your opportunity to explain \nwhat you want to achieve and what will be different because of your work. We \nunderstand that social and environmental change is complex and there are a \nmultitude of factors that contribute to change. We want to understand how you define \nyour role in the overall change you hope to make. You may find it helpful to discuss \nthis with your Oak Programme Officer, and others in your own organisation.   \n7.a. Objectives\nList here up to 3 main objectives for this grant (one sentence per objective). Think of objectives as goals \nthat can be achieved within the lifetime of the grant.  We encourage you to think of objective(s) that are \nambitious but also achievable.  \nObjective: Resilience to climate change among tribal communities is \nincreased through identification of their challenges, their empowerment to \nactive participation in finding solutions for the same and consecutive \ndissemination of the knowledge gained with relevant actors. Interventions to \nimprove the resilience and living conditions of tribal communities, that are \ntested, adjusted to the context and identified as effective, are scaled up in \nterms of geographical and target group outreach through a follow-up project \nfor which funding from private and public institutions is secured.\nThe activities will be undertaken by DRCSC and LRRM as local partners, \nresearch consultants and SoH as German re-granting organisation, facilitator \nand supporter of capacity building workshops in India and knowledge \ndissemination and advocacy events/workshops in India and Germany. DRCSC \nwill be responsible for the direct implementation of research and interventions \nin Hingalganj, Sandeshkhali I Block and Kakdwip Block. LRRM will be \nresponsible for direct implementation of research and interventions in Kultali \nBlock. A project Management board fitted with staff members from both \norganizations will ensure the appliance of equal standards, approaches and \nOak Application Form     10\nmethodologies during research and interventions and support cooperation \nbetween the organizations.\nThe project shall lay the foundation for a planned follow-up project to \nstrengthen the resilience against climate risks of tribal communities in the \nSundarbans and to improve their living conditions. The Objective of the \npresent project (knowledge gained on needs & challenges; development of \neffective and context specific interventions; establishment of networks and \nknowledge sharing between local and international practitioners and donors) \nwill serve as a basis for this purpose. The follow-up project shall be timely \noverlapping with the present project (planned start in 2024/25 \u2013 depending \non the evolvement of the present project) and shall have a budget of between \n800,000 \u2013 1,200,000 EUR. Public and private funding will be secured, inter \nalia, through networking activities under Outcome 1.\n7.b. Expected Outcomes (bullet points):\nWhat do you expect will change because of this grant? What does success look like? List here \nthe main outcomes you hope to achieve or make significant contributions towards with this \ngrant, and for whom.  If you have concrete targets, please also list them here. Outcomes \ndescribe significant changes for people, communities, organisations or systems. Some \nexamples are changes in policies and legislation; changes in knowledge, awareness, \nattitudes, beliefs, behaviours or social norms; changes in capacities, level of influence, \nagency or access to services. Please refer to the guidance for additional examples.\nOutcome 1: Needs and challenges of tribal communities are identified through \nan ethnographic research and different Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) \ntools. Interventions adapted to the local context and target group (Outcome 2) \nare assessed and best practices are identified. The knowledge gained on \nchallenges and effective interventions is shared with relevant stakeholders \nand decision makers.\nGiven the currently scant ethnographic engagement with tribal communities \nin the SBR, research consultants in cooperation with DRCSC/LRRM will \nconduct an in-depth ethnographic study to understand the sociocultural \ncontext, practices, development needs and aspirations of vulnerable tribal \ncommunities, assess their vulnerabilities and climate risks in order to promote \nawareness of, and protection for, their cultures, customs, rights and interests \nand to adapt effective interventions for their needs. To avoid further alienating \nthe marginalized communities and to ensure that development initiatives are \nsustainable in the long term, intervention design must be just, fair, inclusive, \nlocally relevant, and developed and implemented through a people-centred \napproach. Insights from the ethnographic survey, vulnerability and risk \nassessment study and relationship-building exercise will enable the project \norganisers to both assess the needs and aspirations of the communities and \nfacilitate their participation and stewardship in intervention design and \nactivity implementation.\n \nOutcome 2: Community-led development interventions aligned to the needs of \ntribal communities have been designed, piloted, evaluated and improved. \nOak Application Form     11\nClimate risk reduction is increased and the socioeconomic resilience of the \ntarget group is strengthened.\nThe planned activities under this Outcome will be based on the findings of the \npreceding research and assessments (Outcome 1). They are designed \nparticipatory together with the target group in a form that indigenous \nknowledge systems are upheld and combined with scientific methods. The \nprocess is community-led, meaning that the collaborating organizations and \nresearchers\u2019 primary moderate the process, contributing their knowledge and \ncapacities rather than taking the direct lead. The interventions are \ncontinuously monitored, evaluated and improved. The interventions focus on \ngroup formation and empowerment, climate adaptive and diversified \nlivelihoods, organic agriculture, shore protection and dissemination of critical \ninformation to the target group. As the process unfolds over time, the \ncapacities of the community representatives are enhanced to emerge as \ncompetent trainers who can achieve self-reliance and continue the community-\nled work after the completion of the project. Local stewardship will not only \nenable the project team to successfully overcome the communities\u2019 hesitation \nor reluctance in adopting the initiatives but also promote leadership, cohesion \nand decision-making agency.\n \nOutcome 3: Physical and mental health challenges of the tribal communities \nare addressed. Good health is promoted and access to government health \nprograms is established.\nThe absence of adequate healthcare facilities is accompanied with a lack of \nawareness of locally prevalent healthcare issues and health-seeking behaviour \namong the communities. While there is scant literature on the condition of \nphysical and mental health in the SBR, there is an absolute absence of tribal \ncommunities in health and well-being-related research, policy and governance \nin the region. In addition to hypertension, pulmonary and gastrointestinal \nissues associated with certain environmental hazards like soil and water \nsalinity, mental health disorders like depression, suicide and deliberate self-\nharm, often linked with experiences of man-animal conflict, frequent disaster-\nrelated losses and morbidities, are also widely prevalent. Mental health \nsupport is limited to non-existent in the region, with health camps and \nawareness-building workshops seldom mainstreaming mental healthcare. In \nthe event of the dual crisis of pandemic-induced reverse migration and \ncyclone-induced rural-urban migration, the lack of infrastructural support and \nsafety nets for migrants and their families became glaringly obvious, and \ncommunities relied only on psychosocial support from their friends and \nrelatives.\nWhile there is no disaggregated data on the health conditions and needs of \ntribal communities, the collaborating organizations are aware that inter-\ngenerational poverty, neglect and exclusion leads to poor physical and mental \nhealth outcomes within these communities. However, knowledge of the \nspecific drivers of poor health and well-being can only emerge from the \nproposed ethnographic survey. The present objective will synthesize relevant \ninsights from the survey to design interventions to reduce the physical and \nmental health challenges of the tribal communities and promote good health \nand overall well-being through the following activities.\nOak Application Form     12\n7.c.

The \nsuccess and failure of different activities and the outcome will be assessed \nthrough household surveys repeated annually and issue-based focus group \ndiscussions in terms of specific indicators.\nThe assessments under Outcome 1 will examine the degree of vulnerability \nand the scope of climate risk reduction, and agency, leadership and self-\nreliance within the vulnerable communities, particularly women and youth. \nFor that matter a performance indicator matrix will be set up and baseline \nindicators will be assessed.\nMonitoring and evaluation of the progress of the initiatives will be primarily \ngeared upon a WSHG-led process. The collaborating organizations will \nevaluate at 2 levels: (1) internal, to continuously examine how effective, \npeople-centric, culturally-sensitive and gender-responsive the decisions, \napproaches and interventions are throughout the lifecycle of the project. The \nresearchers will conduct yearly and final evaluation surveys, prepare survey \nreports, and identify avenues/indicators of improvement; and (2) at the \ncommunity level, where the group leaders shall continually examine the \nprogress of the initiatives over time, in terms of indicators of inclusivity, \ngender-responsiveness, vulnerability reduction and self-reliance etc.\nb) Learning: The project seeks to learn about the unique vulnerabilities, \nneeds and aspirations of marginalized tribal groups in the SBR, that are \nlargely invisible in research and unreached in development governance. \nThese ethnographic insights will create a support base for planning, up-\nOak Application Form     16\nscaling and implementation of suitable community-led initiatives in future, to \naddress the needs and reduce the vulnerabilities of this population.", "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGES\nWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your \noutcomes and how will you address these?

We encourage you to be \nopen to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your \noutcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? \n(300 words):\nThe project\u2019s approach and proposed thrust of interventions i.e., \nencouraging vulnerable tribal communities in the SBR to articulate their \nvulnerabilities and unique development needs, and piloting suitable \ninterventions to address these through WSHGs and local youths\u2019 groups, is \nlikely to pose multiple challenges and risks. Some of these anticipated \nchallenges relate to mobilization of disempowered groups like tribal women \nand youth amidst their regular duties and struggles, and finding acceptance \nwithin the community for the implementation of innovative and modern \ninitiatives which demand significant behaviour change and inform a slow \nprocess of transformation. The anticipated risks include potential resistance \non the part of powerful vested interests and political lobbies, which poses a \nthreat to community-led work at the frontline. The collaborating \norganizations can reduce these risks by facilitating regular and transparent \ncommunication between the community representatives, state and local \ngovernments and the project team. Another challenge would be in promoting \nsustainable livelihood options among some of the tribes, like the Shabars, \nwho are traditionally hunter-gatherers, predominantly non-agrarian and \ndependent on forest and ecosystem services. The research team shall \naddress this challenge through knowledge-sharing efforts, learning from \nindigenous in similar conditions from other parts of the country/ world as \nwell as by negotiating with the Department of Forest for sustainable use of \nforest resources. Other challenges relate to knowledge gaps about tribal \nconcerns and interests, and gaps in understanding of, and commitment to, an \ninclusive approach to sustainable development, and probable non-availability \nof necessary skills and local resources for facilitation at the frontline level. \nThese knowledge gaps and capacity deficits will be addressed through \nresearch to gain relevant ethnographic insights and training and information \nmaterials for the staff, facilitators, researchers and community \nrepresentatives, to enhance their understanding and capabilities vis-\u00e0-vis \nrights-based, gender-responsive, culturally-sensitive and locally-relevant \ncommunity-led approaches to tribal development.\nOak Application Form     17", "11.

Set up in 2007, Praxis UK aspires to change the \npractice of the North \u2018talking on behalf of the South\u2019 to the South engaging \ndirectly in debates and policies. Praxis UK acts as a platform for grassroots \nNGOs, CBOs and people\u2019s movements from the South to express their voices \nin the North. It is part of a global movement that encourages ordinary and \noften marginalised people to exercise their right to participate in their own \ndevelopment.\nUndertaking participatory action research, enhancing capacities for \nparticipatory development work and engaging with the state through voices \nof disadvantaged identities are some of Praxis\u2019s core domains of work. Our \nvision, beliefs and values influence our work at the local, national and \ninternational level. Our work is wide ranging and spans individuals and \ncommunities and extends up to governments and intergovernmental agencies \nacross the globe. We engage closely at all levels to facilitate community \nleadership and work to implement the most appropriate and effective solution \nin any particular situation. The breadth of our network, combined with our \nknowledge, experience, resources and collaborative approach, enable lasting \nchange to be realised.\nThe trustees of Praxis UK include a mix of senior development sector and \nindustry practitioners who guide the organisation\u2019s work, fundraising, legal \nand other matters.

Praxis\u2019 breadth of experience ranges across most sectors of \nsocial development in Asia and Africa. Three recent relevant achievements \nare:\n1.         Developing community-led ethical review processes to challenge \ninstitutional review boards and ensure that for research to be an intervention \ncommunities affected by the processes have a say in how the research study, \nquestions and instruments are designed and findings analysed. Supported by \nDurham University (2020- 2022)\n2.         Landscape analysis to inform international evaluation in the service \nof equity to explore the paradigm shift, particularly within global evaluation \npolicies and practices. In collaboration with partners in Latin America, Africa \nand Asia, the research included exchanges with a range of funding \nmechanisms to explore how the most excluded and historically oppressed \npeoples, specifically those in the Global South, play a role in determining the \nimpact and value of any program, policy, or initiative developed in \u201ctheir \nOak Application Form     6\nname\u201d and for \u201ctheir development.

(600 words):\nSundarbans is an ecologically fragile zone spread across two countries. There \nis a space for learning from interventions across both. In Phase 1, 114 groups \nof vulnerable people in five Gram Panchayats of Patharpratima (Digambarpur, \nGopalnagar, Herambagopalpur, Achintyanagar and Banashyamnagar), South \n24 Parganas, West Bengal, were identified and brought together to diagnose \ntheir vulnerabilities, articulate aspirations and avenues of change, and work \ntogether. The project covers 20 villages with a population estimate of \n1,06,650.\nAfter Phase 1, field staff assessed that 29% groups were active and functional \n\u2013 meeting frequently, discussing issues of relevance, taking part in activities, \ntaking ownership of issues and expressing a need for continued engagement. \nGroup members found value in learning new information, finding confidence \nand exercising collective bargaining power.  \nThey identified issues for action in Phase 2:\n\uf0a7Effects of climate change (life and livestock threatened by eroding \nembankments and frequent flooding; livelihoods impacted by \nincreasing soil salinity, limited water resources, poor market linkages);\n\uf0a7Gender-based discrimination and violence (early marriage; domestic \nviolence; limited opportunities for girls in education /livelihoods; lower \nwages for women workers; menstrual taboos);\n\uf0a7Limited access to rights and entitlements (poor healthcare; limited \nawareness about government schemes);\n\uf0a7Unsafe migration (dropouts, especially among boys;)\n\uf0a7Lack of sustainable livelihood options (unsafe migration, dropout)\nPhase 2 aims to continue the work done while bridging some gaps:\nOak Application Form     7\n\uf0a7Target-driven activity-focus of implementation that overshadowed \nprocess-oriented actions\n\uf0a7Limited coordination amongst resource agencies affected holistic \nperspective for staff and communities\n\uf0a7Community leadership devoid of perspectives / stands\n\uf0a7Focus of what should change rested with organisations rather than with \ncommunities\n\uf0a7Hesitation / reluctance to PRI engagement\nTo meet these gaps, the consortium framed a theory of change which is \npresented below:\n1. How is change within community visualised?\nAfter forming their own micro-level plans, the dynamics between community \nand organisation changed to dependence because of the nature of \ninterventions and expectations of communities. The transformation being \nvisualised in the community is\n\u2022From formulating plan to owning the plan by periodic revisiting / \nevolving their change journey driven by their unique needs (and \nperspectives)\n\u2022From individual actions / actions that benefit individuals to collective \nactions\n\u2022From receiving organisation\u2019s strategies and directions to community-\nled actions that are more organic, impactful, and sustainable \ntransformation\n\u2022From implementing organisation\u2019s agenda to informing organisation\u2019s \nagenda through careful assessment of their strengths, weaknesses, \nrisks and opportunities\n2. How is change within organization visualised?\nAs community groups assume leadership roles, the organisation\u2019s role \ntransforms\n\u2022From direct control to providing facilitative support\n\u2022From providing trainings to mentoring community resource persons\n\u2022From leading networking initiatives to strategic advice on stakeholder \nengagement\n\u2022From a culture of learning (one-way) to a culture of reflection (analytical \nprocess)\n\u2022From becoming visible in Patharpratima to networking and \ncollaboration that visibilises ACV beyond Patharpratima\n3. Is the project truly being able to reach the most marginalised \u2013 \ncommunities within the village and villages within the block?\nThe consortium must discern whether there are still communities that are \nsidelined because of identity / the work they do / their inaccessibility / their \ninability to give time etc. and what further actions are warranted. For this to \nOak Application Form     8\nhappen within the people-centred, community-led model, it is important for \ncommunities to form their own perspectives around marginalization.\nPraxis UK sees Phase 2 as an opportunity to showcase ACV as a model of \ncross-learning and introspection in other geographies, contexts and funding \nscenarios. ACV\u2019s learnings can be offset with similar experiences of \ncommunity development in Bangladesh and other countries. Praxis UK will \nreprise the role of facilitating collaborative partnerships to sustain and \namplify this model of excellence.", "6. PLACE HOLDER": "6. PLACE HOLDER", "7. OBJECTIVES": "7. OBJECTIVES\nThis is the most important part of your application, as it is your opportunity to explain \nwhat you want to achieve and what will be different because of your work.

We want to understand how you define \nyour role in the overall change you hope to make. You may find it helpful to discuss \nthis with your Oak Programme Officer, and others in your own organisation.   \n7.a. Objectives\nList here up to 3 main objectives for this grant (one sentence per objective). Think of objectives as goals \nthat can be achieved within the lifetime of the grant.  We encourage you to think of objective(s) that are \nambitious but also achievable.  \nTo strengthen people-centred approach in Patharpratima block of \nSundarbans whereby vulnerable communities give voice to their aspirations, \nbetter understand their vulnerabilities and work towards a collective \nresolution of challenges they face \nAchieving highest standards of cooperation among collaborating \norganizations, leading to deep institutionalization of values of partnership \nand commitment for community-led approaches to development that are \nvisibilised before other geographies, contexts and donor organisations\n7.b. Expected Outcomes (bullet points):\nWhat do you expect will change because of this grant? What does success look like? List here \nthe main outcomes you hope to achieve or make significant contributions towards with this \ngrant, and for whom.  If you have concrete targets, please also list them here. Outcomes \ndescribe significant changes for people, communities, organisations or systems. Some \nexamples are changes in policies and legislation; changes in knowledge, awareness, \nattitudes, beliefs, behaviours or social norms; changes in capacities, level of influence, \nagency or access to services. Please refer to the guidance for additional examples.\nOak Application Form     9\nOutcomes of Objective 1\nProgramme looks at a mix of the following: \na) NGOs empower community to collect data on specific issues (a. climate-\nadaptive livelihood; b. gender-based violence; c. different aspects of child \nrights; d. climate and environmental impacts such as embankments) and \namplifies these; b) NGOs create a platform for communities to present their \nvoice; c) NGOs empower communities to create their own spaces, amplify \nissues that are important to them through evidence-backed action. \nBy December 2024, at least three community collectives in each hub of Phase \n1 will take up and follow through issues of community-led stakeholder \nengagement / participatory action research, thereby taking small actions \ntowards collective development (some ongoing issues - access to water and \nstrengthening embankments in Achintanagar / Banashamnagar, improving \nICDS centre and improving library for children - Digambarpur, access to \nambulance - Herambagopalpur, demonstrating models of organic farming and \ntaking actions to sensitise community about child marriage in Gopalnagar). \nAt least five community collectives (model community-led collectives) will \nfollow the trajectory of change from dormant to proactive (existing), from \ncollecting anecdotes / one-time stories to evidence-based analysis, from \nsharing individual and personal experiences to negotiating solutions; and from \nhaving no discussions to having a collective stand on significant issues. By \nYear 2 and Year 3, ten more such model community collectives will be \nstrengthened. (Total 15) (For example, four surveys covering 500+ \nrespondents have been undertaken by adolescents across all hubs on \nmenstruation-related issues such as taboos / menstrual hygiene; this will be \nanalysed through different lenses and the groups will carry out stakeholder \nengagement on accessing menstrual hygiene and addressing root cause of \ntaboos - analysis is ongoing) \nBy Year 3, at least 180 community persons (including 30 fellows and at least \nten members from each of the above mentioned 15 collectives) will emerge as \ninformed change agents equipped to engage on different issues with different \nstakeholders - such as PRI members, VLCPC members, village elders, block \nofficials. The themes the collectives work on will be visibilised through events, \nat different forums and platforms. (Specific focus on use of theatre, folk \nculture and songs, panchayat-level events and three block-level events will \nprovide ample visibility and space)\nIn newer areas, a similar process will be followed, with a maximum of two \ncollectives per new village. \n \nOutcomes of Objective 2\n\u2022Each collaborating organization has initiated attempts to inform and \ninfluence their other programmes and projects with learnings from the \npeople-centred approach of the ACV project. For eg, Mukti's ACV team \nregularly informs and supports its other projects on approaches learnt \nthrough ACV. Rupantaran's team has proposed the use of similar \napproaches in other blocks of South 24 Parganas\n\u2022In Phase 2, organisations must find ways of strengthening \nimplementation of their safeguarding policies, which were evolved and \nOak Application Form     10\nframed in Phase 1 with support from Oak. Praajak will held strengthen \nsafeguarding and implementation of PoSH; financial systems; \norganisational development through cross learning from each other \n\u2022Strengthened donor diversity collectively and individually in Phase 2 \n(December 2024)\n\u2022Consortium-level visibility through events outside Oak universe; in other \ngeographies and locations. For example, participation of partners in \nmenstruation-festival (like Maasika Mahotsav), network with similar \nnetworks working in other states such as Odisha; \n\u2022The consortium brings to the learning space partners from other \nprojects who can strengthen the learning for the members of the \nconsortium, especially in themes such as disaster-preparedness, mental \nhealth, disability where the consortium members have limited expertise \n \n7.c.

Several issues have emerged \nduring Phase 1 which require concerted engagement beyond collectives, \nOak Application Form     12\nthrough nearby Panchayats. (Eg. absence of ambulance in Banshyamnagar-\nAchintyanagar)\nPlan includes to continue engagement with former PRI members whom the \nconsortium has engaged with in Phase 1 and seek their support in \nstrengthening work in Phase 2; Plan includes in developing a strategy for \ninvolving adolescents through module whereby adolescents can voice their \nviews in Bal Sansad (BTS); engage with PRIs (ISWS, RF); Plan includes \nidentifying and engaging with newer PRI members as they are at a stage of \ngetting to know their communities better through rapport building and \nexposure visits (Ex. ISWS through exposure visits to Panchayat was able to \ncreate a space where adolescents raised a demand for a library that the \nPanchayat acceded to)   \n \nActivities timeline of Objective 2\nIn Phase 1, the consortium has achieved a collaborative and constructive way \nof working together.\n1.Strong coordination and collaboration\n\u2022Regular meetings of Steering Committee to be continued for reflection, \ncoordination. Inclusion of at least one community mobilisers from each \nhub within Steering committee to build second-line leadership. \n(Monthly, rotating leadership)\n\u2022Form smaller committees to review consortium's towards goals \nhighlighted in theory of change. These will be anchored by field \ncoordinators and project coordinators. (Quarterly, rotating leadership)\n\u2022In Phase 1, resource agencies struggled to provide coordinated support \nto partners, which resulted in inconsistent pressure on implementing \norganisations. This will be addressed through bi-monthly meetings of \nresource organisations and one organisation taking lead.

COOPERATION": "8. COOPERATION  \nHow will you involve others in your approach to achieving change? If you are \nplanning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived \nexperience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  \nWhy are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are \nchoosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you \nusually work? (300 words):\nIn Phase 1, the consortium publicised different aspects of its experiences in a \nrange of forums, regional, national and international. Through Oak\u2019s grantee \nmeetings too, the ACV experience has received wide attention and interest \nwith organisations expressing interests in supporting the initiative.\nDespite this, the consortium in Phase 1 has been guarded about sharing its \nexperiences widely. This is anticipated to change in terms of visibilising the \nconsortium\u2019s work. The consortium shall proactively seek spaces where \ncommunity leaders can present their experiences of being part of collectives. \nThe planned block-level consultations is a step in this direction. The \nplatforms for the same must be identified through a thorough mapping of \nrisks and opportunities.\nAs mentioned in Section 7.1.a and 7.2.b, the consortium members are also \nidentified spaces where they can facilitate networking platforms, as in \nGopalnagar Panchayat, through partnerships with organisations such as \nTerre des Homme and Welthungerhilfe.\nThere is much scope for engagement with PRIs. In Phase 1, some partners \nactively engaged with PRIs resulting in actions that not only enhanced the \nconfidence of the community, but also created communication channels. This \nwill be taken further in Phase 2.\nOak Application Form     14\nEngagement with media is another area of cooperation which will be \ntargeted in Phase 2.

Increase in self-confidence fo members, especially women \nmembers (women acknowledged that they were being valued as \nfarmers in their own households and decisions around cultivation \nof the second crop was left to them); women organised a solidarity \nevent in Gopalnagar in 2022 on their own, taking part in rallies, \nevents; adolescents carried out a survey of 500+ respondents on \nmenstruation-related taboos and practices \n4. Activities related to embankment protection - In Hermabagopalpur \ncollectives formed groups to monitor the embankments and \nsaplings that had been planted\n5. In Digambarpur, adolescents negotiated with Panchayat to set up \na library for them. Panchayat is carrying out this process     \nb. The consortium has already started the process of instituting an M&E \nframework within the consortium.

RISKS AND CHALLENGES\nWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your \noutcomes and how will you address these?

This built a foundation for the ACV in several locations, \nvisibilising the partners. This also exposed the project in its initial days to \nunreasonable expectations from the community. These were and will be \naddressed through a process of sensitisation.\nThrough gradual processes of trainings, partner staff are being oriented on \nengaging with local administrations such as panchayat, police officers, \nservice providers and others through negotiations and rapport building. As \nthe PRI members in some locations are newly elected, partners can build \nnew relationships through the community members rather than being at the \nforefront of networking.

Context (The context section should not exceed two pages.)\n6a. Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, \ngovernance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nSEWA was founded in 1972 by Smt. Ela Bhatt who was honoured with the \nprestigious National award of Padmashri and Padma Bhushan and gained \ninternational acclaim for her work and was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay award. \nWith her guidance, SEWA has been instrumental in spreading across eleven states \nof India.\nSEWA Bharat, all India federation of SEWA is headed by Smt. Renana Jhabvala \nwho worked in the initial years in Gujarat. She is the recipient of Padma Shri from \nGovernment of India.\nThe Organisation has an executive board which comprises five distinguished \nwomen leaders nominated from the different member organizations of the \nFederation. These members are experienced social workers who have given shape \nto the organization. Their vast experience in the informal economy and with \nwomen workers has contributed to organizing women of the informal sector and \nexpanding the SEWA movement. These leaders have been instrumental in many \npolicy decisions affecting the poor women working in the informal economy, both \nin their states and at the national level.\nThe SEWA Bharat National Coordinator is appointed by the Board to oversee all \nthe activities within the organisation and coordinate with other SEWA institutions \nin a manner that the Federation office can pull in resources from other mature \nSEWAs in addition to the projects that SEWA Bharat implements directly. The \nNational Coordinator is also a bridge between the two National Institutions -SEWA \nBharat and SEWA Union to highlight advocacy issues from the ground to the \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20135\nNational platform.\nSEWA Bharat\u2019s broad organisational strategies are made through the Working \nCommittee, which is elected from the Executive Board with the support of the \nNational Coordinator. The National Coordinator is supported by a Central team of \nsector-specific professionals, Finance & Accounts, HR and Admin teams. Each \nstate also has state coordinators and other programme coordinators and field staff. \nWhere the work covers several districts, the state may have its local admin team. \nSEWA Bharat has a total staff strength of 300+ Employees and full-time \nconsultants.\nA Central Team, consolidated  at SEWA Bharat in 2019, whose core mission to \nfocus on organizational development and strategy, along with the respective state \nCORE teams to work with each other in an integrated approach and create a \nplatform of learning and growth; this enables a streamlined approach to increase \nproductivity and ensure a holistic and integrated approach  towards issues of \nwomen workers \n6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\nFinancial Overview:\nSEWA Bharat has committed funding for the organisation for the next three years \nto the tune of INR 61 Crores. We have committed funding of INR 87lacs - for \nsupporting the project activities in Jharkhand & West Bengal. A dedicated team of \nprofessionals under the guidance of the President and National Coordinator \nthrough networking, bids and any other source of the proposal, tries to raise funds \nfor the normal and special requirements of the organisation. Many of the programs \nwork closely with the Government where the gaps are filled in through \nGovernment support like training space, modules and workshops.SEWA Bharat \ntries to build up a Core and Reserve fund to mitigate against any future risks and \nit explained in details in the following section. \nOne of the challenges that we may foresee is exchange rate fluctuations impacting \nthe FCRA funding. The other challenge is the ongoing pandemic situation, where \nwe have planned certain activities which may not happen in the expected scale if \nthe pandemic and lockdown extends beyond an estimated guess. However, SEWA \nBharat is trying to mitigate these by bringing Digital knowledge to as many of the \ngrassroots leaders through the support of ongoing and potential funding and \nbuilding the capacity of grassroots leaders and staff to hold meetings for training, \nsharing learning and other activities\n \nFunding Model:\nSEWA Bharat has secured funds from various donors like USAID, BMGF, EILEEN \nFISHER, etc to support our ongoing activities. We have also submitted proposals \nfor fundraising which are currently in pipeline through IDS, Pacesetter, Fidelity, \nUpwork Foundation, PCI, etc. We are also applying different strategies for \nfundraising like focusing on individual donors, Exploring online platforms for \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\nfundraising, like Guidestar, Razorpay,  etc. We are also registered as Guide star; \nMilaap; Give India; Upwork; WEIGO; Benevity; Keeto, Equality Fund; USAID; JICA \nCharities Aid foundation. Crowdfunding- we are focusing on our PR and \nCommunications, donations, etc.\n \nReserves and Endowments:\nSince SEWA Bharat goal is to organize workers to achieve their goals of full \nemployment and self-reliance through the strategy of struggle and development. \nThe struggle is against the many constraints and limitations imposed on them by \nsociety and the economy. In order to maintain continuity and to keep our activities \nongoing and address challenges from time to time especially at the grassroots \nlevel, we have created a CORE and reserve fund, where we receive funds through \nan overhead contribution from different projects implemented, interest income, \nmembership fees, donations, etc. Since we are expanding at it is becoming difficult \nto maintain a sufficient level of funds in CORE, we keep on putting our efforts to \nraise funds from different sources. \n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\n1. Establishing SEWA Shakti Kendras (SSKs) as local resource centres have \nbeen one of the most successful initiatives so far. Through the SSKs, SEWA \nacts as an important link with the government for successful outreach of its \nprograms. These SSKs in Bengal have been instrumental in registering 2000 \nmembers and spreading awareness around the State Scheme for \nUnorganised Sector workers introduced in 2018, which led to 5000 more \nmembers registering themselves under this scheme.\n2. Created a network of grassroots leaders called agewans across India in \nspecific geographies. They are the link between people and the government \nand make efforts to reach information to community members, address \ncommunity needs as well as ensure linkages with compensatory packages, \nwelfare schemes and developmental programs. They are at the frontline \nsupplementing the government efforts during COVID-19. Agewans have \nspearheaded the SEWA-led distribution of 50,000+ food and hygiene kits \nand last-mile delivery in places where the reach of the PDS system has been \nerratic. The work of Agewans has been recognised and SEWA Bharat has \nbeen specially mentioned for its support during COVID-19 by the NITI \nAayog.\n3. Most significant in recent times is SEWA Bharat\u2019s participation at the \nUN High-Level Panel [UNHLP] on Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment \n[WEE] and subsequent conversations in India to contextualise the UNHLP \nrecommendations for India. During this period, SEWA Bharat hosted a \ndiscussion with Phumzile Mlambo-ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women \nat its headquarters in Delhi and is right now contributing towards the \ndevelopment of a national roadmap on WEE in India. \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nA detailed note on the strategic plan for the states of West Bengal and Jharkhand \naddressing key questions is also attached (Annexure 1)\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nAs of 2018, both the states feature very low on the Human Development Index \n[HDI] (0.641 and 0.599[1]), and their HDI score is below the national average \n(0.647). With 19.98% and 36.96%[2] of the population of West Bengal and \nJharkhand living in poverty and 71.16% and 56.21%[3] female literacy rates, the \nproblems of poverty, the gender divide in educational attainment, income and \naccess to resources is widespread. Women are often the primary breadwinners \nand caregivers of a household in these states as men tend to migrate out for better \nwork opportunities, yet, women remain at the fringes of work and income, eking \nout a livelihood under extremely exploitative conditions. This gets reflected in the \nfalling Female Labor Force Participation Rate [FLPR] in both states. The female \nlabour force participation in West Bengal has increased from 18.08 in 2011 to 23.3 \nin 2018, the same has reduced from 29.10 in 2011 to 18.08 in 2018 in \nJharkhand[4]. \nIf we see in terms of trades, research shows that most agricultural workers are \nwomen in these states, but their landholding is minimal and productivity has been \nconstantly decreasing due to climate change, migration of males and limited \naccess to government benefits. Beedi workers are struggling to continue with their \nlivelihood and domestic workers are denied leaves and fair wages. SEWA has done \nan exploratory study in Jharkhand, (SEWA Exploratory Study Jharkhand, 2016) \nwhich shows that 63% of women have no awareness of the welfare boards and \nvery few workers have identity cards. We have seen that women take up seasonal \nwork and remain unemployed for a large part of the year. They rely on contractors \nand middlemen to broker their salary and conditions and often entangle \nthemselves in large amounts of debt. Not being able to go up the supply chain, \nupskill themselves or gain income mobility are predominant issues as well. Their \nworking conditions are equally precarious owing to their lack of bargaining power. \nEarly pregnancy[5] is reportedly common, women and girls face restrictions on \ntheir mobility and traditional caregiving roles are encouraged for women while \ntaking up non-traditional work is frowned upon.\nIn the past 3 years in Jharkhand and 16 years in West Bengal, SEWA has unionised \nand collectivised more than 20,000 women in the informal economy. SEWA has \nworked towards increasing collective bargaining strength, empowering \ncommunities to access information and entitlements through SSKs, enhancing skill \nand creating opportunities for access to markets. The effort is being led by a cadre \nof 129 agewans (grassroots leaders). Following are the preliminary findings from \nthe end-project impact assessment (phone-based) study conducted in both states in \nJuly-August 2020.[6]\n\u2022A majority of the respondents, that is 65.60%, women attend unit \nmeetings organised by SEWA at least once a month. While the remaining \nmembers attend meetings once in two or three months.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\n\u202250% of all members have received at least one type of training offered \nby SEWA in the last 2 years.\n\u2022Among all trades/work, a majority of domestic workers (57%) and beedi \nworkers (51%) are aware of at least one form of entitlement/govt. or \nemployer benefit that they are eligible for (minimum wages[44%], weekly \noffs [31%], provident fund [24%], Occupational Health Safety compensation \n[29%], Tool and Safety Kit Support Scheme (25%), Use of traditional seeds \n(13.6%) and Organic fertilizers(10.6%)\n\u202266.3% SEWA members have indicated that they received information \nabout trade-specific entitlements and benefits from SEWA compared \nto other sources of information.\n\u202222% of SEWA members have ever used the SEWA Shakti Kendras \npremises  to apply for a scheme or to apply for a government identification \nor avail a government benefit\nGoing forward, we would strengthen the existing cadre of agewans so they can \nlead community efforts and SSKs and create new agewans and SSKs. We would \nalso address women\u2019s trade-specific needs, explore alternate livelihoods so women \ncan diversify or pivot their income sources and simultaneously, look to build our \ngrassroots advocacy. The next generation of young leaders will also be created to \nensure continuity of the movement and relationships with the local administration \nand government officials will be nurtured to ensure strong private-public \npartnership. The above feeds into SEWA Bharat\u2019s commitment to ensuring full \nemployment and self-reliance for women in the informal economy. SEWA Bharat \nhas been building the capacity of its member organisations and advancing the \nrights of women workers through its twin goals of organising and struggle. We \nhave different streams of work focused on unionising women; advancing gender \nequality and rights; trying out innovative and different models of organising \nwomen such as union, federation, cooperatives, collective social enterprises, \nproducer companies; and fostering women\u2019s economic empowerment by \nincreasing women\u2019s access to market and finance.\nThough the registration process for a state union has been facing bureaucratic \nbarriers in Bengal, SEWA members continue their alliance with the National Union \nand would continue holding trade group meetings as is done within a formal union \nstructure in the state.\n \n[1] Sub National HDI Global Database https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/IND/\n[2] Handbook of Statistics on Indian States by the Reserve Bank of India \nhttps://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook%20of%20St\natistics%20on%20Indian%20States\n[3] Census of India, 2011\n[4] Annual Report - Periodic Labour Force Survey 2018-2019 by Ministry of \nStatistics and Programme Implementation \nhttp://mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Annual_Report_PLFS_201\n8_19_HL.pdf\n[5] In the Fourth National Family Health Survey Percentage of women aged 15-19 \nyears who were pregnant or already mothers during the survey in West Bengal is \n18.3%  and in Jharkhand is 12%. http://rchiips.org/NFHS/factsheet_NFHS-4.shtml\n[6] The final report is being compiled for circulation.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139", "7.

Objective 1\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\n1.Strengthening the capacity of the cadre of Agewans: Currently, we \nhave developed 129 agewans [69 agewans in Jharkhand and 60 agewans in \nWest Bengal]. SEWA is now looking to intensify its agewan strengthening \nprogram with a total of 205 agewans. We will use SEWA\u2019s agewan \ndevelopment module to give training to new agewans and refresher training \nto the existing cadre. In addition, the agewans are also trained in \nnegotiation skills with their employers, Mahajan, local authorities and family \nmembers. We will be adding new topics such as addressing violence in the \nworld of work, basics of data collection, evidence-based advocacy and digital \nliteracy. Exclusive training will be held on digital literacy with online \ntraining during the COVID restriction phase.\n2.Community Meetings led by agewans: Agewans will lead the village-\nbased unit meetings with the women over the next 3 years.

Objective 1\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\n\u2022A cadre of 205 grassroots leaders/agewans will be built in the next 3 years \nwith leadership, negotiation and decision-making skills to lead the \ncommunity advocacy efforts\n\u202214 Yuva Mandals of 15 girls each will be created to foster youth leaders and \nchampions at the grassroots level in the next 3 years\n\u2022A total of 41,000 members will be strengthened across the two states over \nthe next 3 years\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201310\ncontribute to and participate in village council meetings. SEWA will \nhandhold agewans during the 3 years and track progress post-training.\n3.Developing youth leaders and champions and strengthening the \nexisting champions: SEWA has created 10 Yuva Mandals reaching out to \n140 girls in West Bengal in the past 3 years. SEWA will make efforts to \nsustain the existing 10 Yuva Mandals in West Bengal and the 4  new Yuva \nMandals in Jharkhand while seeking to initiate a few new Yuva Mandals in \nJharkhand. These youth groups will be trained in two thematic streams: \nbasic aspects of gender equality being one which will include good touch \nand bad touch, life skills, sexual and reproductive health, problems related \nto early marriage; social issues and technical skills including digital \nliteracy, research methods and data collection techniques. Emphasis will be \nlaid on the importance of safe migration and self-defence to prepare girls for \ntheir life going forward. We will work with Integrated Child Development \nServices [ICDS] to link with government schemes, with counselling and \nhealth services meant for adolescent girls. These youth leaders and \nchampions will play a key role in taking this movement forward.\n4.Organizing exposure visits: SEWA\u2019s training model integrates classroom \ntraining with practical training that includes regular interaction with \nstakeholders and exposure visits. To this end, exposure visits are aimed to \nengender cross-learning and information sharing, building a broader and \npragmatic understanding of ground-level situations and understanding the \ndifferent models/pathways of work in other states and organisations along \nwith developing empathy and compassion among the grassroots leaders, \nyouth groups and SEWA team members. In the past, SEWA has conducted \nexposure visits to different other SEWA states, for example, women of West \nBengal visited Jharkhand earlier to meet SEWA Jharkhand members. This \nhelped them to see the replicability of learnings and adapt the learning from \nthe other states. In a similar manner, exposure visits will be organized to \nother SEWA states to facilitate an understanding of the nuances around \nSEWA\u2019s unionisation and movement building work over the years.\n5.Capacity building sessions of state teams to SEWA ethos and \nobjectives of the program: SEWA Bharat has worked with a dynamic \nproject team in the past years and will continue to build their capacities so \nthey can effectively implement this project as well. To this end, SEWA will \ncarry out refresher training for team members on SEWA ethos, on SEWA \nunion and its years of struggle and movement building work. Additionally, \nteam members will receive training in gender equality and decent work for \nwomen, how to take collective action, and how to challenge patriarchy. \nSEWA will develop the team\u2019s understanding of the objectives of this \nprogram. Though the project has been developed in consultation with \ngrassroots teams, orientation and onboarding exercise will revitalise the \nteam spirit, triggering cross-learning and information exchange.\n6.Organising campaigns for community awareness generation: In the \npast years, campaigns have played a crucial role in inspiring attitudinal \nchange in West Bengal and Jharkhand. Therefore, SEWA will organise \ncampaigns on a rolling basis to circulate key messages on welfare schemes, \nlife skills, health and on prevention of violence against women in the world \nof work. Information on new opportunities will be circulated. Examples of \nrole models will be shared through these campaigns and linkages will be \nensured.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201311\n7.2.a.

Objective 2\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\n1.Strengthening the existing SEWA Shakti Kendras [SSK] and creating \nnew SSKs: SEWA has set up 6 SEWA Shakti Kendras (SSKs) as local \nresource centres in West Bengal and Jharkhand. The SSK is a place where \npeople meet and share their common concerns and have dialogues to \naddress larger issues faced by them, at the same time obtain up-to-date \ninformation on all programmes and schemes. It connects community \nmembers with government schemes and services. Our efforts are to make it \na community-owned, community-managed centre under the leadership of \nwomen and young people. Based on the needs assessment done this year, \nSEWA will aim to set up 8 new SSKs and strengthen the 6 existing \nSSKs with infrastructure and digital tools across the two states in the \ncourse of 3 years. (Refer to Annexure 2 for the model)\n2.Training cum orientation of SSK centre-in-charges: A total of 14 SSK \nin-charges will be trained in two-phased training with a focus on digital \nliteracy and use of digital devices and software.

MIS systems will help record and \ntrack information on members and help generate reports. All data will be \nentered into the digital MIS systems. SEWA will continue with its holistic \napproach of hand-holding beyond the training period through post-training \nagewan engagement activities and meetings and will prepare the agewans \nfor community engagement, government liaisoning and grassroots \nadvocacy.\n7.3.a. Objective 3 (maximum one sentence):\nTo collectivise women workers [beedi workers, domestic workers, \nconstruction workers, street vendors, agri-workers] to enable them to \nbetter engage with stakeholders in the value chain for full employment \nand have better access to markets and resources\n7.3.c. Objective 3\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\n1.Strengthening the trade groups: In the past years, SEWA has organised \nand unionised women into separate trade groups at the community level. So \nfar, West Bengal has 1 domestic worker group and 3 beedi workers groups \nwhile Jharkhand has 1 construction worker group, 15 domestic workers \ngroups, 9 construction worker groups, 22 agricultural worker groups. These \nhave been formed for women to share and discuss their concerns within \nthese groups. In the next few years, SEWA will strengthen these groups \nfurther with the leadership of the agewans. Strengthening a group will \nrequire training and handholding agewans and linkage building. The trade \ngroups will address the sector-specific needs.\n2.Strengthening trade committees: SEWA has set up trade committees \n7.3.b. Objective 3\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\n\u202230% of the women domestic workers trained will have increased wages and \nweekly offs\n\u202210,000 beedi workers will have access to PF benefit\n\u202230% trained in tailoring and stitching will have increased income\n\u202210% agri-workers will have increased productivity\n\u2022200 women/girls will be linked with alternate livelihood\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201313\n(representation from all sectors, unlike Trade group which is sector-specific) \nin the two states. In West Bengal, trade committees will decide the work \nand strategy for the whole year for the different trade groups and will carry \nout the advocacy agenda on specific issues along with sector-specific \nworkers and local and state-level authorities. They will feed into the \nadvocacy of SEWA national council meetings and unions. The trade \ncommittees will look to increase the membership base within the trade \ngroups to bring more workers under this solidarity building movement. \nTrade committee meetings will take place once a year.\n3.Promoting evidence-based advocacy through multi-stakeholder \nplatforms and meetings: Past learnings have shown that multi-\nstakeholder meetings are a great way to advocate and increase the visibility \nof SEWA\u2019s work. SEWA will create a platform for members so they can \narticulate their needs in front of the inter-sectoral agencies, including \ngovernment officials, private sector players and other CSOs etc. Block, \ndistrict level and state level meetings in both states will be conducted in \nyear 2 and 3. The main purpose of these meetings will be to highlight \nchallenges in front of government officials and figure out synergies to \nenable the creation of shared agendas that can help take common initiatives \nforward in a collaborative partnership with multiple agencies. The evidence \ngenerated at the unit meetings, trade group meetings and the MIS will feed \ninto the advocacy event. The key emerging advocacy issues have been \naround wages, working conditions, provident fund, worker\u2019s recognition, \nincome and market access so far. Alongside this, separate trade-specific \ncampaigns will help highlight and collectively bargain for the needs.\n4.Exploring and linking with alternate livelihoods: Due to COVID, \nSEWA\u2019s stream of workaround exploring and linking with alternate \nlivelihoods has become strong. To that end, an orientation program on \nalternative livelihoods will be organised in partnership with National Rural \nLivelihoods Mission [NRLM] district representatives at the block level in \nboth the states. Simultaneously, the sectors of agriculture and animal \nhusbandry will be explored in Jharkhand with local authorities and NGOs. In \nWest Bengal, through the existing 2 centres, we will continue to offer a 6-\nmonthly training on sewing-tailoring for young girls. SEWA in Malda will tie-\nup with the government training programs for preliminary and advanced \ntraining in sewing and tailoring. We will also explore other hyper-local \nneeds so the children of beedi workers can take up other trades as beedi \nwork has emerged to be unsustainable due to anti-beedi campaigns.", "8.

Based on two rounds of Case Analysis conducted by Sanhita, we \nobserved that the number of complaints reaching out to Sanhita has gradually \nincreased over the years.\n\u2022Award: Founding Director of Sanhita has been felicitated by GoWB for \ncontribution to the SHW issue in 2016.\n \nThe following achievements of Sanhita\u2019s work on the issue of SHW since \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139\n2015 under the Oak Foundation Support are recognised in the External \nEvaluation (conducted in 2021):  \nGround Breaking Work:\n\u2022Sanhita\u2019s work on sexual harassment at workplace has been ground breaking \nin the context of West Bengal, their engagement spans across government \ndepartments, civil society organisations, law networks and grassroots \noutreach.\n\u2022Sanhita has established and maintained several partnerships that has helped \nthem grow and expand the work they are doing and the support they are \nproviding spanning from training, IEC materials to research & crisis support.\nResponses from the Government Stakeholders:\n\u2022Across government stakeholders there is an agreement, that Sanhita was the \ncorrect organisation to engage as they were experts in the field of sexual \nharassment law, specifically the organisation\u2019s expertise, dedication and long \nhistory of working in the field.\n\u2022Sanhita is thus perceived and recognised as being experts in the field by \nvarious government departments.\n\u2022The networking efforts have allowed Sanhita to be deeply embedded, that is \nthey are recognised and have established relationships and connections \nwithin government systems as the go-to organisation where sexual \nharassment is concerned.\nResourceful IEC and Training Modules:\n\u2022Sanhita has been successful in creating IEC materials whose uptake by \ngovernment departments is a significant achievement.\n\u2022Across SHW Committee members interviewed there was a great appreciation \nof Sanhita\u2019s IEC materials which have been greatly beneficial to the \norganisations and have been used for multiple purposes and at multiple \nlevels.\n\u2022The adaptability of their training modules and their ability to engage \neffectively with a section that is largely left out is commendable.\nResponses from the SHW Committees and Institutional Associations:\n\u2022Across SHW Committees there is a strong recognition of the support they \nhave received from Sanhita. Especially the fact that Sanhita has been \n\u201cproactive\u201d, \u201csensitive\u201d and \u201cpractical\u201d in their dealing of complaints.\n\u2022SHW Committee members have also spoken of the times when Sanhita has \ngone above the call of duty and supported them through very difficult and \ntrying times and how their support gave the Committee courage to fight \ndifficult battles especially against those in power.\n\u2022Sanhita was ascribed to be \u2018extremely proactive\u2019 and \u2018consistent\u2019 in their \nefforts, by the Institutional Associations.\n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201310\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nSanhita is a Gender Resource Centre established with the vision of gender justice \nand gender equity.  Sanhita was founded in the year 1996 to mainstream gender \nconcerns by enabling institutional accountability and systemic changes.\nThe current strategy of Sanhita for the period from 2021 \u2013 2026 is based on the \nabove and has emerged from its past experiences and learning as well as the \nrecommendations of the External Evaluation conducted in 2021:\n\u2022Promoting institutional responsibility for safe workplaces for institutionally \nemployed women workers particularly those from resource poor backgrounds \nthrough:\n\u2022Institutional capacity building and \n\u2022Developing prevention and redressal mechanisms of varied stakeholders (like \nrelevant government departments, monitoring & regulatory bodies, district \nadministration, employers, institutional associations among others)\n\u2022Developing issue based strategic partnerships with working groups, \nconfederations and networks of employers\u2019 and institutional associations \namong others\n\u2022Strengthening redress of SHW by\n\u2022Capacity Building of Complaints Committees through training and \ncounselling services,\n\u2022Intervention & support to women workers and Committees through helpline, \n\u2022Engagement with Committees as external members and advisors to \nmonitoring bodies and different organisations \n\u2022Capacity Building of External Members\n\u2022Developing understanding of the field realities & the implementation status \nof the Act that would shape future work of Sanhita and \n\u2022Continued Knowledge Creation on the issue of SHW for the various \nstakeholders across sectors through \n\u2022Constant review and analysis\n\u2022Evidence based field research\n\u2022Development of IEC and training materials in local languages\n\u2022Promotion of access of women workers to useful information \n\u2022Review of SHW complaints\nThe Recommendations of External Evaluation (conducted in 2021) of Sanhita\u2019s work \non the issue of SHW since 2015 under the Oak Foundation Support:\n\u2022Sanhita needs to percolate down to the grassroots level to include \nmore marginal and vulnerable women -\nThis is being planned & done presently under the PHF funded project where \nthe Anganwadi Workers and leaders of the SHG federations are being reached \nout to through engagement with the relevant departments.\n \n\u2022Need to work on Data Management of cases wherein data is made \navailable to Sanhita, through its engagements, be collected and \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201311\nmanaged in a systematic manner to enable further research -\nPeriodic analysis of SHW complaints sourced from State Women\u2019s \nCommission as well those complaints where Sanhita was engaged either as \nan external member or in an advisory role is part of Sanhita\u2019s ongoing & \nregular work. We plan to share the findings with the monitoring bodies for \nthem to take necessary steps for improving the redress mechanisms.\n \n\u2022Sensitisation of top-level Management in Private Sector Industries \u2013\nSanhita has already initiated the work through strategic partnership with CII. \nWe plan to extend this work to other confederations of industries and \nemployers\u2019 associations under this proposal.  \n \n\u2022Additional Training for ICs \u2013\nThis is being addressed under the PHF funded project where in a detailed \nSituational Analysis of the current status of ICs is being undertaken. Based on \nthe findings of the Situational Analysis, need based training will be organised \nto enhance the knowledge and skill of ICs for better and effective case \nredress.\n \n\u2022Sensitisation of Men should be made a priority \u2013\nSensitisation of men is already being partially integrated in our work. We \nconsciously engage with men as part of our orientation with the HR from \nindustries and PSUs, representatives of workplace associations and various \nprofiles across government departments.\n \n\u2022Broadening understanding of Third Party Harassment \u2013\nSanhita plans to focus more on this through its Training and Orientation \nProgrammes and IEC Materials. \n \n\u2022Need for an in-depth study to understand the needs of women in the \nunorganised sector for greater accountability \u2013\nThis will be part of our long-term strategy and will be undertaken in collaboration \nwith relevant institutions working with unorganised women.\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nThe premise of the project is to work on the issue of creating safe workplaces for \nwomen.\nSexual harassment is a manifestation of sex discrimination and violence against \nwomen at the workplace that thrives in an atmosphere of threat, terror and reprisal. \nSexual harassment at workplace adversely affects the safety, dignity, mental and \nphysical well-being of women resulting in loss of life, job and livelihood opportunities \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201312\namong others. It is a manifestation of power relations as women are much more \nlikely to be victims of sexual harassment because of their status at work, \nvulnerability, insecurity, and social conditioning.\nChallenges\n24 years post the Vishaka Judgement and 8 years post the enactment of the SHWW \nAct, implementation of the Act in the true spirit is yet to happen. There is however, \nno comprehensive data on the complaints of SHW is available. Based on Sanhita\u2019s \nexperience, the number of recent court judgments and the narratives available post \nthe #MeToo Movement it emerges that many workplaces still believe that SHW is a \nrare or trivial issue and that the women are responsible for their harassments.  \nEvidence shows that the complaints are not dealt with sensitively.  When the woman \nattempts to speak out the pattern is to subvert her credibility to prove that the \ncomplaint is motivated, if not false. \nLack of employer accountability towards effective prevention and redress of SHW \nand the gaps in the Act to define the role of monitoring and regulatory bodies, have \ncreated several loopholes and cracks in the redress process.\nDue to the absence or limited access to redress mechanisms, the women workers \nfrom resource poor backgrounds and the precariously positioned ones among the \ninstitutionally employed remain particularly vulnerable. \nThe SHWW Act 2013 is geared towards safety of women workforce and as such may \nbe read as gender specific, applicable to only cisgender women. However, in a \nchanging world order where notions around gender identity and expression are \nimportant markers of personhood, the Act might have to be extended in order to \nmake it inclusive of transgender persons.\n \nOpportunities\nThe legal framework for employer responsibility towards safe working environment \nis enshrined in the Constitution of India which provides the basic opportunity for \nworking on the SHW issue.\nThe landmark Vishaka Guidelines and the SHWW Act provide a comprehensive \ndefinition of SHW and include all kinds of women at workplaces under its ambit. The \nAct places the onus for safe workplaces on the employer and provides the aggrieved \nwoman recourse to civil proceeding alongside existing criminal proceeding.\nThe scope for addressing and working on the SHW issue expanded manifold when \nthe issue took centre stage in 2018 because of the # Me too movement and brought \nrenewed focus to the prevalent cultures within organizations that perpetuate SHW \nand victimize women.\nWith regard to the issue of SHW, the legal landscape in India has been a constantly \nevolving one and has led to progressive judgements of Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court and \nHigh Court leading to organisations across sectors reviewing their compliance to \nthe Act. The scope for work increased by inclusion of SHW in the various service \nrules and in the Section 29 (d) of Code on Wages, 2019 and Section 134 of \nCompanies Act, 2013 which mandated compliances through service rules among \nothers.", "7.

While the government has introduced flagship welfare \nschemes through the tea board and introduced bills such as Plantation Labor \nAct (1951), poor implementation hasn\u2019t improved conditions. In this context, \nSwaniti aims to work closely with the network of civil society organizations, \ndistrict administration, and state government to operationalize core welfare \nprograms for tea garden workers. For example, all tea garden workers should \nhave access to adequate housing. However, most local administration does not \nadhere to even the basic standards of housing. Lack of governance overview has \nled to the deprivation of this key group. In this context, Swaniti and it's partners \nproposes to embed teams into each affected district and state government to \nwork with the local ecosystem and ensure the delivery of programs. The team \nwill be expected to come up with joint solutions and implement them with the \nsupport of the local administration. By the end of the program, tea garden \nworkers will be expected to have access to public programs.", "4. GEOGRAPHY": "5.List the major countries where your activities take place.

Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, \ngovernance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nSwaniti was founded in 2012 with the goal of strengthening governance tools. We \nbelieve that if public services are accessible and inclusive to the most vulnerable \nthen they will have an opportunity to grow and thrive with equal opportunity. With \nthis in mind, Bhattacharya founded Swaniti by supporting Parliamentarians and \ndistrict administration through key knowledge insights. Bhattacharya drew from \nher experience of interning at Senator\u2019s offices. She eventually received a \nMaster\u2019s in Public Policy from Harvard Kennedy School and joined the World \nBank. The founding of Swaniti has been an accumulation of her experiences in \nworking in the governance space. Today, the Swaniti board consists of similarly \npassionate individuals including Richard Rossow (India Chair at Center for \nStrategic and International Studies), Elizabeth Gamino (development professional \nand advocate on equal rights), and Shantanu Agarwal (Venture Capitalist working \non climate and sustainability technologies). Subsequently, Swaniti\u2019s senior \nleadership also brings in similar experiences and commitment to government. Our \nleadership has significant experience in public service with tremendous insights \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20135\ninto challenges on the ground. For example, our COO comes with experience from \nNITI Ayog where he was part of the evaluations team. Similarly, our program leads \nbring in the experiences from institutions such as the Ministry of Planning (central \ngovernment), the Department of industries (Andhra government) and the \nMonitoring Project Management Unit (Ranchi district). Given that Swaniti aims to \nimprove local governance in public service delivery, we maintain a decentralized \nmodel of placing team members within the community to better understand and \ndeliver on programs. Team members placed with state governments come from \ngrassroots background but are expected to maintain strong communication skills. \nFor example, we have onboarded Aspirational District Fellows who have \ndemonstrated strong verbal and written skills through the recruitment process. \nThese team members come in with 5-7 years of work experience and advanced \ndegrees. We have found such professionals to bring in the emotional intelligence \nto manage community based roles. All team members are expected to connect with \ncommunity members, civil society partners, and government stakeholders to \nensure that they have the whole picture and their contribution. Swaniti combines a \ntop-down and bottom-up approach: our senior leadership connects with all mid-\nlevel and junior associates on a bi-monthly basis to get their insight on projects \nand their experiences. Based on this feedback we design or iterate projects. This is \ncoupled with our impact evaluation and talent management team also connecting \nwith them.For this project, Swaniti plans on leveraging our previous experiences \nto ensure strong team design and program implementation.\n6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\nSwaniti is a non-profit entity with seventy percent of its funding coming from \nfoundations such as Climateworks, McArthur, and Ford Foundation. And the \nremaining thirty percent is through government partnerships. When working with \nFoundations, Swaniti works in a tri-partite model where we provide technical \nassistance to state governments with their cooperation while we are being funded \nby a foundation partner to accomplish specific outcomes. Our annual operating \nbudget for 2021-22 is at 3.5 million USD as we continue to expand our work across \nstates and districts. Our biggest partners include UNICEF, SED Fund, and Laudes \nFoundation. With the exception of the upcoming grant from National Democratic \nInstitute, all our grants our focused on work within India. Swaniti\u2019s fundraising \nstrategy is to focus on multi-year state programs where we hope to focus on two \nareas of development: a.) economic response to climate change and b.) social \nprotection for vulnerable populations across India. Using our corpus which is \nsupport by Skoll Foundation, Swaniti is continuing its work with legislators and \npolicymakers. In the upcoming years, Swaniti is currently in conversation with \nBloomberg Philanthropies and Children\u2019s Investment Fund for projects in India \nand Bangladesh.\nSwaniti recognizes that as we scale up, it is important to have in place partners \nwho can support us in our work in India. In order to strengthen Swaniti systems \nfurther, we plan on partnering with reputed organizations who can continue to be \nkey partners on programs. These partners would be FCRA-compliant and include \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\nthe likes of Digital Empowerment Foundation and UN Women. Swaniti expects \nthese agencies to not just be alligned programmatically but also have regional \npresence in states where it is working, including in West Bengal. Through \nprograms such as the proposed project of the Oak Foundation, we hope to uncover \norganizations who have alignment with Swaniti's mission, to ensure that programs \nare codesigned and executed smoothly. We believe that this would allow for our \noverall systems and programs to be strengthened. Thus we are particularly excited \nabout the Oak proposal since it is providing us the opportunity to build on the \nabove mentioned model. As we continue to scale Swaniti's growth, we hope to be \nable to establish strong partners and work in India. \n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nSwaniti Initiative aims to deliver public services to the poorest of the poor by \nstrengthening governance. Swaniti is a 501(c)3 with a team size of over 100+ \nprofessionals. In the past, we have worked in states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, \nOdisha, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. In the process, we have been \nable to establish direct advisory support to Chief Minister\u2019s offices in \nChhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Assam, and Meghalaya. Swaniti team constantly \nmonitors our policy impact on the ground. We do so by developing detailed \nlogframes with output, outcomes and impact indicators to tangibly measure the \nimpact of our work. We have seen that our interventions have established inclusive \nsystems and processes for the most most vulnerable in government policies. In \nAndhra Pradesh, for example, Swaniti Initiative has been able to significantly \nimprove last mile delivery of MGNREGS by reducing payment errors by \napproximately 90%. In Jharkhand, the team has been able to mobilise public \nfinances to enable the transition towards a green ecosystem in the state by \nuntapping high amounts of public finance. Interventions undertaken include \ninstallation of solar rooftops in government buildings, provision of EV vehicles to \nANM workers for effective last mile delivery of healthcare, employment generation \nand increased incomes through solar pumps etc. These are just some of the \nsystemic and process changes that have worked on. To accomplish the goal \nmentioned above, Swaniti has had the opportunity to partner with established \ninstitutions like World Economic Forum, Harvard University, and the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies. Through our ten-year experience, we have \nbeen able to mobilize over 5 million dollars of untapped funding and impacted over \n300,000 lives. We have been acknowledged for our exceptional work by \npublications like Forbes (30 under 30 lists for work with Swaniti), Fortune (40 \nunder 40 lists), World Economic Forum (as Young Global Leader), Special Invitee \nto the White House, and Australia \u2013 India Youth Dialogue Young Leader.Swaniti\u2019s \nwork has been featured in national and international publications including Indian \nExpress, Times of India, Hindustan Times, Reuters, and NPR.\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nKey to Swaniti\u2019s strategy in the next five years is to work in a collaborative model. \nSpecifically, Swaniti plans on building on its current cross-sectoral model of \nworking with multiple stakeholders to ensure policy and implementation change in \ngovernance. Swaniti sees the role of the government as being catalytic in serving \nthe community. However, to be sustainable and scalable, programs need to engage \nwith communities and bring together local partners for successful execution. \nAccordingly, Swaniti pursues a triangular model of collaboration in overall service \ndelivery. The three key stakeholders who maintain a symbiotic relationship are as \nfollows:   The community is our primary stakeholder. To make a program \nsustainable it is important to ensure that the program is deeply rooted within the \nrequirements and expectations of the community. Therefore, the field teams begin \nall engagements by holding community-level meetings with key stakeholders like \nvillage council members, women\u2019s self-help groups, small landholding farmers, etc. \nOnly with key input from community members does the program design move \nforward. The field teams invest several months to build trust within the \ncommunities and understand gaps and opportunities in public service delivery.  As \nhighlighted above, the government is a key collaborator. Swaniti embeds itself in \nthe office of the local administration to ensure the requisite support systems for \nservice delivery exists and complements it with counterparts in state offices to \nensure scalability. Swaniti sees government as a critical level in ensuring the \ndelivery of key social safety programs that can lift people out of poverty and \nprovide them with an opportunity for better quality of life. Our government \ncounterparts are a critical part of Swaniti's work. Finally, partnerships of local \nNGO partners who can help in program implementation are a key part of the \nprogram. NGOs bring in critical insights on how to operationalize local solutions \nwithin the communities and our seen as the \"local solution providers\". In this \nparticular program, we hope to partner with the Digital Empowerment Foundation \nwho would be bringing in their \"Soochnaprenuers\", community members who have \na thorough understanding of local programs and will help tea garden workers \nenroll in various government initiatives. Soochnaprenuers is a program piloted and \nscaled by DEF. The local entreprenuers, known as Soochnaprenuers, will bring in \nthe hyperlocal solutions needed to resolve the current knowledge and enrollment \ngaps of various government programs. \nOur past experience has shown that this is the most impactful model and therefore \ngoing forward we are focusing on the same for our current strategy.  \n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nIndia\u2019s local governance systems are broken. This makes it difficult for the most \nvulnerable to have access to basic public services that are critical to growth. 78 \nmillion people are eligible for government-funded programs. The Indian \ngovernment spends over 58 billion USD on ensuring food security 42 billion on \ncreating economic opportunities, and over 126 billion on social protection \nprograms. Yet India is home to 20 percent of the world\u2019s poor who are living in \nabject poverty. Despite the government\u2019s will to lift people out of poverty, many \nfall through the cracks because local administrations often don\u2019t have the tools for \nlast-mile delivery.\n Local governments lack the three Ps...\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\n                     ...skilled people at a local level who have the knowledge, expertise, \nand drive to effectively execute and reach most marginalized\n              \u2026.meaningful civil society partnerships to complement the government \nefforts and create checks and balances for robust long term program delivery\n                \u2026.strong processes which include continuous monitoring and \nevaluation.  \nMost governance-centric efforts are concentrated at a national level. The weakest \nstates, districts, and villages often have little or no tools to improve local \ngovernance. Yet local governments are the touch points for public services. To \ncorrect this imbalance, it is critical to work with government administrators at a \nlocal level in weak and laggard districts and states. This proposal focuses on \nworking with local governance to be able to solve issues around social protection \nfor tea garden workers.\n \nBased on the consultations with grassroots organizations, we learned that there is \nno role of middlemen/contractors in the hiring of the tea workers. The hiring \nhappens through heredity. For instance, the original person who was hired \nprovides replacement through some family member and the cycle goes on. Office \nstaff are interviewed by the DBITA (Dooars Branch Indian Tea Association). Tea \nworkers lack the required documentation for most schemes and programs. \nWorkers don't have aadhar cards or bank accounts. However, even with an \nalternate id proof (if any), the process is very cumbersome in accessing programs \nlike maternity benefit scheme. Even RTE is defunct for the tea workers. Paralegals \nare trained how to acquire the relevant forms etc but implementation hurdles limit \npossible impact levels. \nThe impact of access to scheme is ultimately seen in developmental outcomes. \nThese include multilayered challenges in the form of health, sanitation etc. \nFollowing aare some of the outcome challenges within the state:\n1. Severely compromised health infrastructure included limited doctors and \nmedicines. \n2. Tea workers do not have access to entitled ration\n3. Sanitation, housing and drinking water are big challenges.\n4. Separate electricity meters in the living quarters and the electricity bill is borne \nby the workers.\n \nThus with these outcomes and broken governance systems, it is important to help \nstrengthen the process of public service delivery of tea garden workers. Through \nthis proposal, Swaniti hopes to address this issue.", "7. OBJECTIVES": "7.

(You may use additional space if you have more than three objectives)?. \nUnder each objective describe the activities that your organisation will undertake to \nachieve it, including time frame and the results or outcomes you expect to achieve.\n7.1.a. Objective 1 (maximum one sentence):\nTo identify the availability and extent of accessibility of tea workers to government \nwelfare schemes and other entitlements\n7.1.b. Objective 1\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\nThe output would include recommendations on ways to improve access to schemes \nwhile also generating livelihood opportunities. From this exploratory study, we \nhope to understand the dynamism and challenges faced by the tea workers in their \necosystem in terms of their access to social security entitlements such that an \nimplementable and sustainable policy recommendation can be designed. The \nexercise will be built on the existing research studies that focus on the tea garden \nworker community and their vulnerability in terms of access to their entitlements. \nInsights from existing research studies such as Bhowmick (1982,1992, 2011, \n2015), Sadhukhan (2014), Ghosh (2014), Thakur (1995) etc will serve as the base \nfor the project.\nTo meet the objective, the Swaniti team and it's partner will be performing the \nfollowing set of activities:\n\u2022Conducting FGDs with constituents, semi-structured interviews, and \nhousehold surveys on various socio-economic-infrastructural indicators to \nachieve an in-depth understanding of the on-ground situation.\n\u2022The findings from the field will then be substantiated by engaging with \nvarious stakeholders from different spheres, including government, civil \nsociety organizations, and grassroots partners to leverage their knowledge \nof institutional and local enforcement challenges and to identify needs for \ninstitutional capacity building. The Swaniti team would also conduct a pilot \nsurvey for the questionnaire testing before rolling out the final survey.\n\u2022Based on the survey findings and stakeholder consultations, the Swaniti \nteam will then also map out the government processes and bottlenecks in \nprogram delivery.\n\u2022Since tea plantations fall under the agrarian economy it is likely that tea \nworkers have limited or no exposure to modern skill development training \nor technology. Accordingly, Swaniti will leverage the expertise that it has \ngathered through its experience in the RESET (Roadmap for Ecological and \nSustainable Energy Transformation) project in Jharkhand in employment \ngeneration and apply them for West Bengal.\n \nThe indicators for skill identification will include:\n\u2022Number of skill development workshops conducted\n\u2022Number of workers trained; the number of alternate jobs generated\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201310\n7.1.c. Objective 1\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\n \nThe overall objective of this phase is to identify the availability and extent of \naccessibility of tea workers to government welfare schemes and other entitlements \nby a.) conducting assessment about the current state of access and mapping \n\u2022Number of workers transitioned to alternate livelihoods\n \nThe overall project will be carried out in three phases, a total period of 24 months \nto achieve the desired objectives.\n \nThe first objective and the associated activities will be carried out in Phase I which \nis a period of 3 to 4 months. In this phase, the fieldwork will begin with data \ncollection in at least three districts, namely Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Cooch \nBehar. Swaniti team proposes to carry out data collection in four tea estates within \neach district where the estates will be decided based on the following indicators:\n\u2022Estate Size: STGs and Large estates\n\u2022Status of the estate: profit-making closed tea estate\n\u2022Number of currently employed tea workers\n \nSwaniti will also be interviewing retired tea workers. The prospective theme for \ndata collection will comprise but not be limited to:\n\u2022household details (education/ nutrition statistics for children; number of \ndependents etc)\n\u2022socio-economic status\n\u2022awareness and access to schemes and entitlements\n\u2022details about working conditions\n\u2022major challenges etc\n \nThe primary study participants will include tea workers, we have found that and \nestate owners/managers. Secondary stakeholders include worker trade unions, \nnearby SHGs, Panchayat, etc. We have done an inter-district comparison between \nJalpaiguri and Kooch Behar in terms of socio-economic indicators including sex \nratio. The final sex ratio will be decided once the sampling strategy is finalized. \nHowever, as per our standard practice, we aim to keep an equal composition of \nmen and women in FGDs. Additionally, Swaniti team will also engage in \nconsultation with stakeholders including the government, field partners, like-\nminded CSOs, and grassroots organizations. Digital Empowerment Foundation \n(DEF) will be supported Swaniti to design the survey by leveraging their past \nexperience of working with team garden workers in Assam. Additionally, they will \nexpect to mobilize young people from the ground to support conducting these \nsurveys, with the hopes that these youth can eventually become Soochnaprenuers \nand help inform tea garden workers about their rights and ways to access them. \nDEF will build on its Soochnaprenuer model from other districts and states. \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201311\nbottlenecks in the delivery of public programs b.) and; surveying and interviewing \nconstituents to recognize limitations and opportunities.The primary study \nparticipants will include tea workers and estate owners/managers. Secondary \nstakeholders include worker trade unions, nearby SHGs, Panchayat, etc. \nAdditionally, the Swaniti team will also engage in consultation with stakeholders \nincluding the government, field partners, like-minded CSOs, and grassroots \norganizations.\n \nData will be collected through the following methods:( Phase 1: 3-4 months)\n\u2022Focus group discussions: Within each tea estate, the Swaniti Initiative team \nwill conduct 1 FGD with a cohort of 10-15 people each. Beneficiaries will be \nsampled through purposive sampling in consultation with our on-ground \npartners. Further, the team will ensure that each focus group discussion \nconsists of a diverse range of beneficiaries including women, tribal/ SC \npopulation, and contractual/ permanent employees. We expect that the \nprimary resistance to enter the estate and communicate with the workers \nwill in fact come from the garden owners. In order to counter this, we are \nworking on a separate risk and mitigating strategy that involves working \nwith various tea councils and the Ministry of Commerce\u2019s cooperation with \nthe Tea Board.\n\u2022Household surveys: Apart from the focus group discussions, in order to gain \na thorough understanding of the situation on-ground and to begin \ndeveloping a baseline, the Swaniti Initiative team will conduct household \nsurveys in each estate. Households will be selected through snowball \nsampling. Data will be collected on various indicators including current \nsocio-economic conditions, access to schemes, challenges being faced, etc. \nThe sets of entitlement to the workers come from two broad sources. (i) \nFlagship schemes of the government through Tea Board and State \ngovernment (Chai Sundari) and (ii) the now-dissolved PLA 1951 where \nunder the Act, the entitlements are the responsibility of the estate owners \nand the administering the process is the responsibility of the state \ngovernment. Through the baseline, we aim to understand the challenges to \naccessing both these.\n\u2022Semi-structured/ in-depth interviews: Apart from the data collection from \nbeneficiaries, the team will be conducting interviews with other identified \nstakeholders to substantiate its findings from the field as well as to \nunderstand the supply side of the issue.\n\u2022The outcome of this phase is to understand the major challenges being faced \nby plantation workers in accessing benefits and identify potential \ninterventions to address these issues.\nWhile the Swaniti team will be collecting data from the ground, the Digital \nEmpowerment Foundation will take this opportunity to recruit young people from \nthe community to support the on ground data collection process. These youth will \nalso have their capacity built about the rights and services that tea garden \nworkers should have access toward. In the upcoming phases of the program, the \nyouth, known as Soochnaprenuers, will be expected to help in increased \nawareness and enrollment of tea garden workers, into government programs. \n \n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201312\n7.2.a. Objective 2 (maximum one sentence):\nObjective 2 To strengthen systems and processes by collaborating with state \ndepartments and district administration and build capacity, knowledge insights, etc. \nof local officers to ensure tractable public program delivery by identifying \ninterventions suited for the local context.\n7.2.c. Objective 2\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\nIn this phase of the project to achieve the second objective, Swaniti will work with \nthe district and state administration in providing program implementation support. \nSystems and processes strengthening and capacity building can be achieved by:\n\u2022Providing Technical Assistance to the Government: Swaniti team will \ndeploy three fellows to work with the District Magistrates office and one \nstate coordinator will be deployed to work with a nodal department. These \nresources will translate the working module of the recommendations into a \ncontinued government mechanism.\n\u2022Training and Capacity Building: To ensure that the project will keep \nrunning even after Swaniti\u2019s tenure is over and in the absence of continuous \ninvolvement of on-ground partners, Swaniti will ensure that the local \nadministration is trained for sustainable implementation of the \nrecommendations. Swaniti team and it's partners, Digital Empowerment \nFoundation, will also aim to bridge the gap between the government and the \ncommunity. This is important because, without this connection, there will be \nno advantage of proximity which can exploit transparent communication \noptimally. Hence, despite implementing the recommendations, there will \nalways remain a gap between the beneficiaries\u2019 lack of entitlement and /or \naccess to the same and the government\u2019s attempt to solve the same. In this \n7.2.b. Objective 2\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\nIn this part of the project, the set of actionable policy recommendations will be \nimplemented thus initiating Phase II of the project. The second phase will be for a \nperiod of 12 months. The outcome of this phase would be to develop an overall set \nof sustainable policy frameworks containing a set of actionable recommendations \nand intervention strategies and implement the same at the administrative level to \nstrengthen the governance of service delivery which will, in turn, enhance tea \nworkers\u2019 access to public programs. Accordingly, the Swaniti team seeks to \nengage with multiple stakeholders including:\nThe broader outcomes of this phase are: \n\u2022Recommendations have been adopted by the department\n\u2022Reports/ findings/ recommendations have been submitted to the department\n\u2022New departments have been onboarded\n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201313\nrespect, the training of government officials will be based on the statement \nof purpose (SoP) of the recommendations which can be process \ncorrection/new schemes/increasing budget allocation of existing schemes, \netc. This training can be done for example by conducting capacity-building \nworkshops. The community, on the other hand, will be trained by the \nSoochnaprenuers who are recruited and onboarded by the Digital \nEmpowerment Foundation. These entreprenuers will be working closely \nwith the DEF team members to organize the most effective structure of \ncommunity engagement and will be working with them to be able to setup \nthese meetings. Additionally, through the previous phase, we would be able \nto gain significant data on eligible schemes and programs for tea garden \nworkers and Soochnaprenuers would be able to gain from this knowledge \nand disseminate it in the community. \n\u2022Pilot Testing Interventions: Swaniti will support the government to pilot-\ntest the interventions in the selected baseline geographies in order to \nunderstand the efficacy of the project. Based on the outcomes the capacity \nbuilding can be updated as a part of the upscaling and course correction \nprocess.\n\u2022Further, there will be an advisory committee that would include subject \nmatter and sector experts who will assist in vetting Swaniti\u2019s \nrecommendations. This advisory committee will be introduced to the \ngovernment by Swaniti where their role and importance will be explained.\n7.3.a. Objective 3 (maximum one sentence):\nObjective 3: To establish a strong bottom-up policy framework that can be scaled \nacross the State for larger policy adoption\n7.3.b. Objective 3\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\nThe outcome of this phase is to create a local ecosystem of accountability and \noversight by connecting civil society partners with government agencies to ensure \nthe sustainability of the program. Swaniti will facilitate such that local NGOs hold \nperiodical meetings with the district magistrates and provide him/her with \ncontinuous insights, state of conditions, and solutions about the tea garden \nworkers. Additionally, the presence of local youth, Soochnaprenuers, who would \nbe expected to continue supporting tea garden workers, will also ensure the \nsustainability of the program.   The Soochnapreneur model has volunteers who \nhave door-to-door access to beneficiaries. The total number of such volunteers will \nbe decided at a block level during the mid-term stage of the program once the first \nphase of adoption or implementation starts. One may consider this model very \nsimilar to a CSC ( Common service center) hub and spook ecosystem or a Banking \nCorrespondent setup.\nSince we are collaborating with the Soochnapreneur program, we will be \nleveraging their model to ensure there is no exclusion such that the program is \nsustainable.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201314\n7.3.c. Objective 3\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\n\u2022Sharing the SoP of Recommendations with Sectoral Experts: Swaniti \nwill assist in conducting high-level meetings with sectoral experts, \nbureaucrats etc where the SoP of the recommendations can be revisited and \nbrainstormed on to obtain specialized insights on improving inclusivity and \nsustainability.

Through this project, Swaniti aims to not just aid in short-term \nprogram delivery but also hope to create long-term systems.\n\u2022The medium-term output would be measured by: \noThe increase in access and uptake of schemes and entitlements can \nbe measured by the percentage of beneficiaries registering for and/or \nregistered beneficiaries accessing the entitlements.  This can be \nverified with government data/surveys.\noA number of changes are institutionalized within the governance \nsystems and local ecosystem. This is only possible with a robust \nmonitoring system created through the local civil society ecosystem. \nThis component will focus on translating the recommendations and \nsolutions as part of \u201cgovernment functioning\u201d. For example, the \nadministration might implement systems to ease the enrollment of tea \ngarden workers into various programs. This can be a permanent \nchange that should be implemented at a district level.  In order to \nensure the long-term sustainability of our interventions, Swaniti \nInitiative ensures the capacity building of government officials and \nrelevant stakeholders. Grievance redressal and timely monitoring of \ninterventions are a part of this training. This is done by establishing a \nstrong communication channel and feedback loop between the district \nand state teams of Swaniti who form a point of bridge between these \ntwo administrative bodies. In Andhra Pradesh, Swaniti Initiative has \nsuccessfully demonstrated this model where due to our intervention \nthe grievances recorded have jumped from 25 complaints a month to \n125 a month for the MGNREGS scheme due to our systems that have \nbeen adopted by the Dept of RD and PR.\n\u2022The long term output would be measured by:\nChange in the socio-economic parameters of the beneficiaries. This can be \nmeasured by recording the change in income, socio-economic indicators like \nhealth, education, nutrition, access to safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, \nhousing, etc, through government data or surveys. In short, the long-term \nexpected outcome would be an improvement in the quality of life of the \nbeneficiaries. Swaniti Initiative will develop a log frame identifying outputs (short \nterm), outcomes (midterm), and impact (long term). The short-term indicators \nwould measure factors like awareness levels, documentation for accessing \nentitlements, etc. The projected timeline to witness this is 7-8 months. In the \nmedium term, the outcomes measured will include percentage increase in \nbeneficiaries, uptake of schemes, etc. We predict approximately 12-16 months to \nwitness this change. In the long term, Swaniti envisages better socio-economic \nindicators for the beneficiaries. This will be measured at the end of the project, but \nit might take longer than 2 years to witness the tangible socio-economic impact. \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201315\nproject.\n\u2022Monitoring and Evaluation: Swaniti will work closely with local partners \nto develop a culture of periodic \u201cinformation sharing\u201d with the local and \nstate administration by sharing real-time data assessment on the \nperformance and feedback on grievances. Having a continuous monitoring \nsystem would provide the government with a ground perspective on the \nstate of rights and services of tea garden workers and open up an active \ndiscussion with the government.\n\u2022Establish a Continuous Feedback Mechanism: to enable beneficiary \ninputs at every stage of the project by leveraging our on-field network of \npartner organisations, district associates, and the state lead. In this phase. \nSwaniti will also focus on community engagements. The field partners will \nplay an important role as advisors in communicating the community \nfeedback to the government to foster a culture of dialogue on public service \ndelivery and eventually scale up the project presence. It is critical to take a \nconstructive tone to ensure that these conversations are fruitful and \nsustainable. Thus, Swaniti will be leveraging its experience from other \nprojects to ensure that this is the case in West Bengal.  Additionally, state \nand district fellows will analyze how community actors and government can \ndevelop a continuous feedback and course correction loop to ensure that tea \ngarden workers continue to receive basic rights. For example, convening \nmonthly meetings where civil society members can share key data points \nabout how tea garden workers are performing. The convening will hope to \nnudge conversation about the continued gaps and possible solutions in \npublic programs. This will also feed into the monitoring and evaluation \nprocess. This stage is expected to overlap with Phase II. The Civil society \nagencies can be our \u201ceyes and ears on the ground\u201d and provide critical \nfeedback to the administration about their functioning of key programs. This \ncan be strengthened through the development of a dashboard.", "8. COOPERATION": "8. Cooperation\nDescribe the level of cooperation with other organisations and networks \nand explain how this cooperation helps achieve your goals (maximum 300 \nwords):\nSwaniti has been continuously engaging with grassroots organizations like \nNazdeek, Traidcraft, and the Family Planning Association of India. These \norganizations work with marginalized communities and have helped us to \nrefine our proposal based on their on-ground insights. The organizations have \nprovided deeper insights on violation of rights and institutional and local \nenforcement challenges to policy implementation. Cooperating with these \norganizations has highlighted issues that not only reveal violations of tea \nworkers\u2019 rights to social security but also identify implementation problems \nthat require immediate attention. These findings include (1) since PLA is the \nemployer's responsibility the local governments (PRIs) have moved away from \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201316\nassuming any responsibility for the welfare of tea workers despite being \nincluded in schedule 6. Also, it remains unimplemented in West Bengal; (2) \nmost tea workers are from Oraon community but not included in ST list and \nhence have no access to public programs; (3) tea workers have no access to \nschemes like PM Kisan which are applicable to farming programs; (4) absence \nof labour commissioners and hence unsettled disputes related to employer\u2019s \nprovident fund persist; (5) although 50% to 60% of tea workers are women, \nthere is a huge lack of organization bodies for women representation and they \nare not allowed to form SHGs; (6) high rates of school dropout, child labour \nwhere children are remunerated based on per kilo lifting basis; (7) tea workers \nare not allowed to migrate unless they provide replacement from family; (8) \nsignificant lack of accountability as there is a lack of audit certification for \nmost tea estates as owners don't allow audits; (9) there is a nexus between \nestate owners and local administration where owners register for MNREGA \nwith false promise of providing 100 days\u2019 work to tea workers and obtain the \nfunds without actual employment. Cooperating with this network of \norganizations, can help us understand the tea workers ecosystem and \nchallenges better and hence create targeted policy interventions that can be \nimplemented to strengthen governance for the delivery of welfare entitlements \nto the tea workers community.\nIn addition to working with these organizations, Swaniti also plans on \npartnering with Digital Empowerment Foundation. Digital Empowerment \nFoundation has worked  with tea garden workers in Assam in increasing \naccess to government programs. With a budget spent of 22 crores annually \n(approximately 3 million USD), Digital Empowerment Foundation has previous \nexperience of working on large scale programs. We hope to be able to build on \ntheir experiences of working with tea garden workers and bring in ours of \nworking with government. The partnership will allow for a strong program \ndelivery. With DEF being a FCRA-compliant, we hope to provide a sub-grant to \nthem through this program and have a programmatic partnership. We are in \nthe process of finalizing the above (and have provided a tentative budget based \non discussions thus far). We plan on submitting the details of finalized roles \nand responsibilities to Oak Foundation team members in the next month.", "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. Impact\nWhat is the change you want to achieve from the overall project? (maximum \n300 words):\nGiven the distressed background of tea workers, the goal of this project is to \nstrengthen the delivery of government programs to tea garden workers. In this \nrespect, first, Swaniti aims to improve the delivery of public programs to tea garden \nworkers by translating the set of recommendations to government functioning. The \nprimary focus of this impact of the project is to create a sustainable program \ndelivery change to secure the social rights and entitlements and access to \ngovernment programs by strengthening implementation. For instance, through this \nproject as the gaps and challenges in accessibility and provision of tea workers\u2019 \nentitlements and reasons for the same are identified, Swaniti aims to highlight \nwhether there is (a) complete absence of some socio-economic entitlements; (b) \ndifficulty in access to the same; (c) impediments in the delivery mechanism at the \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201317\nadministration level which requires process correction, etc. Following the \nidentification, Swaniti will work with the administration and other stakeholders in \ncorrecting the loopholes. For instance, if the main obstacle is administrative process \nimpediment, Swaniti with work in tandem with the administration with the help of \nthe district and state fellows to correct the same. Further, to achieve sustainable \nadoption of the recommendations, Swaniti will work towards utilization of funds \nfrom the Government's side. We would ensure that the policy recommendations that \nget adopted will have a separate budget head or mobilize the government to allocate \nunder-utilized funds that make the program institutionalized. The second impact \nSwaniti aims to achieve is to create a local ecosystem of accountability. Swaniti aims \nto achieve this impact by engaging the community with civil society partners and \ngrassroots organizations through regular sessions where the tea workers can \nupdate their existing conditions and whether there has been any tangible change. \nThis feedbacks will then go to the government through the civil society members to \ncreate a continuous feedback and correction mechanism which will ensure the \nsustainability of the program.\n10. Evaluation\nHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):\nFor evaluation, a monthly monitoring system will be put in place in the form of an \nexcel tracker the team leads or a person appointed by the lead will update the \nmonthly deliverables at the beginning of each month. At the month-end, the \ntracker will be updated with the actual outputs. This will enable us to map the \nmonthly deliverables with the actual progress. The tracker will also note the \nreasons for being unable to achieve the monthly deliverables, the challenges faced, \nmitigation strategy to ensure a course-correction mechanism. This includes \ngathering insights on the process being followed, external and internal challenges \nfaced as a team, and feedback to make the process more effective and efficient. \nProcess monitoring will be further substantiated by a quarterly HR review, \nconducted through anonymous surveys. All team members will fill in their \nresponses, to track their views on challenges being faced and means to improve on \nthe project. Problems of a severe nature can be addressed by the HR/project lead, \nas convenient. This will provide a space for the individual team members to \nprovide their views on the workings of the project. Apart from these, the M&E \nteam will also carry out spot checks and back-checks to ensure the quality of data \nbeing collected. For impact assessment, every 6 months, there will be a medium-\nterm outcome evaluation report which will assess if the targeted outputs have \nbeen achieved or not as per the pre-defined project design and goals. At the end of \nthe project, a broader impact assessment will be carried out which along with \noutcome evaluation, will also assess the impact of the project on the lives of \nbeneficiaries/key stakeholders/change in governance mechanisms, etc. through a \npre-post assessment methodology. In addition to this Swaniti Initiative follows the \nrecommended 2-5% allocation for MEL activities. This is a best practice based on \nDevelopment Assistance Committee (DAC) recommendations for OECD. Just to \nexplain this in a bit more detail, Swaniti Initiative will follow a pre-post \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201318\nmethodology to measure outputs, outcome, and impact. Our internal Evaluation \nframework comprises 4 key performance indicators centers around systems and \nprocesses, bottom-up planning, capacity building, and mobilizing public finance for \nkey welfare programs. Apart from these, the team in collaboration with the \nrelevant stakeholders and will develop a detailed log frame to identify project-\nspecific output and outcome indicators and the ways of measuring the same.", "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11. Future Plans\nHow will the grant influence the organisation and future plans? (maximum \n300 words):\nAs mentioned in the previous section, this project is part of Swaniti\u2019s larger goal of \nbeing able to create models of effective implementation in social welfare programs \nat the state level. Having \u201cmodels of excellence\u201d will allow creating a national \nprogram for countrywide improvement since we would be able to showcase the \nsteps taken for more inclusive and accessible government schemes and programs. \nThe focus of this program being rights and entitlements of tea garden workers \nwould help create one such intervention that can be showcased to NITI, PMO, and \nother state governments for larger adoptions. Swaniti will hope to take the \nlearning from this particular condition to other districts and states and provide \npointed feedback on how to bring systemic change. We have already initiated \nmany of these practices. For example, we are bringing our experiences of working \non job creation in Jharkhand to West Bengal.

(300 words)\nWater For People began working in India in 1996 in North 24 Parganas in \nWest Bengal. In 2008, we established a locally registered arm governed by \nan eight-member board, Water For People India Trust. Since 2011, we have \napplied the Everyone Forever model, a long-term approach focused on \nsustainable water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services. \nApplying our Everyone Forever model, with its emphasis on partnerships \nwith local governments and communities, has resulted in significant progress \ntowards the completion and rehabilitation of improved water and sanitation \nsystems, strengthened by municipal and local structures. This transformative \nWASH program in India is helping Everyone \u2013 every community, household, \nschool, and clinic \u2013 gain access to these critical resources across 10 \ndistricts/blocks in West Bengal in South 24 Parganas (Sagar Island, \nOak Application Form     6\nPatharpratima, Namkhana) and Birbhum (Rajnagar), in Bihar, Sheohar \n(Sheohar block, Dumri Katsari, Piprahi, Traini Chowk, and Purnahiya), and in \nMaharashtra, Amravati (Chikhaldara). Eight districts/blocks now have new or \nimproved water services in all communities, the five blocks of Sheohar \n(Bihar), Sagar Island, Patharpratima, and Rajnagar (West Bengal) and seven \nhave new or improved water services in all households, including \nPatharpratima.  \nThese efforts have resulted in intermediate or high levels of water services \nfor 1,548,915 people across 10 Everyone Forever districts/blocks, affecting \n93% of the population in these blocks. These areas include five blocks in \nSheohar (Bihar), Chikhaldara block in Amravati (Maharashtra), and four \nblocks in West Bengal. \nWater For People and Panchayat and Rural Development Department \n(Governments of West Bengal and Bihar) have signed Memorandum of \nUnderstandings in which Water For People formed a Technical Support Unit \nwith embedded staff to assist government flagship programs such as Jal \nJeevan Mission. The Unit provides support to these departments for \ncommunity engagement, program management, capacity building and \ntraining of state, district, and local level officials. This support aims to assist \nthese states to achieve the ambitious goals of the Jal Jeevan Mission (a \nfunctional household water tap connection to all households in rural India by \n2024), SBM Phase II, and Jal Shakti Abhiyan (water conservation \ninitiative). This Unit also works with communities to develop plans and \nmodels to manage their water resources.  \nWater resources in the areas where we work in India are severely affected \nby climate change. There are more frequent tropical storms, sea levels are \nrising, and drought persists. Erratic rainfall, changes in timing, intensity and \nduration of precipitation has adversely affected surface water, putting \nadditional pressure on ground water resources. Water For People India \naligns its water resources management (WRM) activities with the Indian \ngovernment\u2019s water conservation initiative, Jal Shakti Abhiyan\u2014Catch the \nrain when it falls where it falls. We provide training to master trainers, \nguiding them to work closely with communities and villages to develop \nclimate resilient Village Water Safety and Security Plans (VWSSPs). These \nplans include budgets for conducting water quality testing, measuring water \nsources, and planning availability. Under these plans, Water for People \nsupports the installation of aquifer storage units, ridge and furrow models, \nand creation of recharge pits for surface water management. VWSSPs are \nincorporated into Gram Panchayat Development Plans. We also work with \nfarmers to reduce pumping needs for irrigation. In addition, in schools, we \ninstall roof top rainwater harvesting systems to serve as an \nalternative/supplemental water source.  \n5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? \nHow will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and \ndecide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \nOak Application Form     7\ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nWater For People is very familiar with the Sundarbans\u2019 challenges, having \nworking in Parganas, West Bengal since 1996. This area has a population of \n2.79 million living in about 1,100 villages. Most people, including many from \nscheduled tribes and castes, live in acute poverty and depend on agriculture \nfor their livelihoods. This region is very vulnerable to climate change\u2019s \nfrequent cyclones, floods, and sea-level rise. These events have led to saline \nsoil, seawater intrusion, aquifer contamination, brackish aquaculture ponds, \nand increased incidence of waterborne diseases. Progressive salinization of \nrivers and groundwater has resulted in the decline of available fresh \ndrinking water. The demand for groundwater has increased to meet \nincreasing demand for crops, which, combined with limited rainfall, is \nresulting in the over-extraction of groundwater and a severe crisis during the \nsummer.  \nBased on our experience, all activities that Water For People India carries \nout in communities related to water security aim to build resilience as part of \nthe overarching goal of communities surviving climate change. A community \ncannot survive climate change if water sources are not secure, namely \naccessible and of sufficient quantity and quality. The people contributing the \nleast to climate change are suffering the most. We cannot continue to wait \nfor mitigation efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to correct \nthe injustice.?It is time for the people directly facing threats to their water \nsources to have resources necessary to adapt.? \nWe plan to use Oak Foundation\u2019s funding to strengthen integrated water \nresources management (IWRM) in Patharpratima and Gosaba, two blocks \nwith ecosystems highly vulnerable to cyclones. In Patharpratima block, 23% \nof the population is Schedule Caste, 0.8% is Schedule Tribe. In Gosaba block, \n62.7% is Schedule Caste, 9.5% is Schedule Tribe. We will work closely with \ncommunity leaders and members, particularly those from marginalized \ngroups such as Schedule Castes and Tribes, and women.  \nThis work will empower those community leaders to lead efforts to adapt to \nclimate change by ensuring water security.?IWRM acknowledges the pivotal \nrole of water as a finite resource and advocates for its judicious allocation \nusing a comprehensive approach to address the multifaceted challenges \nposed by climate change, particularly for tribal communities. These \ncommunities are often reliant on local water sources for sustenance with \nIWRM offering enhanced water security. By implementing sustainable \npractices such as rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge, and efficient \nirrigation methods, women who traditionally bear the responsibility of water \ncollection, can experience reduced physical burden and increased access to \nclean water.  \nIWRM can also serve as an educational tool, enhancing tribal communities' \nunderstanding of hydrological processes, water conservation strategies, and \nclimate change impacts. This knowledge empowers everyone, especially \nwomen, to make informed decisions regarding water use and management, \nproducing a culture of environmental stewardship and adaptive learning. \nAlso as women are primary users of water, they are interested in learning \nOak Application Form     8\nthe scientific and social context of ground water depletion as it greatly \nimpacts their daily lives, and how to put into practice newly acquired \nknowledge for the community's benefit. \nIWRM also enhances public health through improved water quality due to \nIWRM's emphasis on monitoring water quality, pollution control, and \nwatershed management. By mitigating waterborne diseases and \ncontamination, tribal communities experience improved overall well-being \nand reduced healthcare burdens, particularly benefitting women in tribal \ncommunities through improved maternal and child health. \nFor women's empowerment, IWRM and the approaches proposed are \ninherently transformative as it involves women in decision-making processes \nrelated to water management, challenging traditional gender roles and \namplifying women's voices. Participation in water committees, resource \nplanning, and advocacy initiatives elevates their status and influence within \nthe community, nurturing a more gender-equitable society. \nIn addition, IWRM can catalyze diversification of livelihoods by integrating \nwater-sensitive agricultural practices and aquaculture. This not only \nmitigates climate risks but also stimulates economic growth within tribal \ncommunities, reducing their vulnerability to external shocks. By enhancing \nwater security, supporting education, promoting health, elevating women's \nempowerment, and augmenting livelihoods, IWRM becomes a catalyst for \ninclusive and sustainable development. \nTo strengthen IWRM, Water For People, PRASARI, and Akvo propose to build \non the tested approach of participatory groundwater management (PGWM) \nfor select villages in the Sundarbans. This approach incorporates a deep \nunderstanding of surface and groundwater interactions and values and \nincorporates community knowledge to solve complex water problems. \nSuccessful implementation of PGWM requires an understanding of \ngroundwater science from the perspective of the local population too.  \nFirstly, within the Participatory Groundwater Management (PGWM) process, \nthe community will engage in the mapping of IWRM activities and models \ncurrently in place. It is necessary to validate the traditional IWRM models \nusing scientific methods. Subsequently, this knowledge will be disseminated \nto the community through various platforms, leading to the development of a \ncomprehensive community plan focused on ensuring the sustainability of \nwater sources. As a result, the PGWM process will involve the identification \nof different categories of traditional IWRM models, with particular attention \ngiven to identifying models that have been damaged or reduced in \neffectiveness. During the execution phase, appropriate modifications will be \nmade to ineffective traditional IWRM models either with direct support or \nwith convergence from government departments.? \nWe will nurture local leaders and community-based institutions, particularly \namong women-led Self-Help Groups, supporting them to map the aquifers, \ndelineate resources, facilitate water budgeting, and scenario building for \nmanaging water. In addition, we will combine outcomes of community-based \nwater quality mapping with predictive analysis models leveraging available \nand relevant historical data for community and local institutions to make \ninformed decisions regarding the sustainability of their water sources. We \nintend to act as enablers, with local communities and their institutions \nOak Application Form     9\ndriving the process. Since PRASARI and Water For People have built trust in \ncommunities in these blocks for years, interventions will begin quickly.  \nParticipatory approaches and IWRM require investments of time and \nresources before fully realizing benefits. We will use Oak Foundation\u2019s \nfunding to design the program and activities together with the government, \ntraditional leaders from schedule castes and tribes, and local communities. \nWe will facilitate discussions between local government and communities to \nensure sustainability by creating an advisory committee that includes senior \ngovernment officials from state and district governments, local elected \nbodies, and Panchayati Raj Institution members. We will involve traditional \nleaders, developing a cadre of communities to build their capacity to plan, \nbudget, and develop demonstration of freshwater harvesting and aquifer \nrecharging models for three years. After the close of the initial project, we \nwill build on investments and link communities to government campaigns/ \nresources to fund water security plans and infrastructure solutions. As Water \nFor People is embedded in the West Bengal state government, we will foster \nincorporating water security plans into Gram Panchayat Development Plans \n(GPDPs).  \nIn addition to incorporating these plans in GPDPs, locally elected bodies and \nPanchayati Raj Institution members will play an important role in decision \nmaking to leverage government resources. From project inception to \ncapacity building exercises and workshops to develop community-led water \nsecurity plans and solutions, vulnerable community members, traditional \nleaders, and locally elected bodies will participate in every stage. We will \nensure regular communication among all stakeholders and jointly celebrate \nsuccesses. By aligning water security plans with existing government \nschemes (Jal Jeevan Mission) and programs, we will also facilitate efforts to \nensure that community institutions and their representatives receive \ngovernment acknowledgement to access water security financing. \nWithin communities, we will apply Elinor Ostrom\u2019s principles to strengthen \ncommunity-based institutions. We recognize that based on data collected and \nanalyzed, these principles may be modified to fit the Sundarbans\u2019 challenges \nsuch as cyclones. We will embed possibilities for modifications. Participatory \nplanning along with building capacity of local communities will result in the \ndevelopment of evidence-based water security plans with local community \nleaders conducting water budgeting, identifying potential recharge areas, \nand/or expanding traditional water harvesting practices. In addition to these \nactivities, demonstration models complete with freshwater harvesting or \naquifer recharge solutions will be completed in select villages of \nPatharpratima and Gosaba blocks. Informed by data and depending on \ncommunity consensus, solutions could include land shaping for furrow and \nhigh ridge cultivation, \u201cFive Square\u2019 water harvesting structures that \nPRASARI has implemented in Gosaba, aquifer storage and recovery systems, \nand/or rooftop rainwater harvesting systems with tanks. \nIn general, PGWM may seem like a niche topic. But at its core, PGWM builds \ncapacities of communities to map and manage their own resources, \ngenerates local employment (e.g., barefoot hydrogeologists), and empowers \nlocal communities to make data-driven decisions. Our initial projections \nsuggest that about 200 barefoot hydrogeologists and the corresponding \n1,000 water and sanitation committees will participate. It's important to note \nthat this is a preliminary estimation, and the final figures may vary. \nOak Application Form     10\nOak Foundation's investment in PGWM will show the multi-faceted \nsuccessful outputs of this approach to strengthen IWRM, allowing other \nlarge funders to leverage this water-focused method to achieve their \noutcomes related to job creation, community development, and climate \nchange adaptation. The three organizations (Water For People, PRASARI, \nand Akvo) work with several donors that are interested in climate-water-food \nnexus and/or livelihood development, such as Caterpillar Foundation, \nWelthungerhilfe (WHH), Axis Bank Foundation (ABF), and Ajim Premji \nPhilanthropic Foundation. We also work closely with global knowledge \nplatforms like World Water Quality Alliance and Water Point Data Exchange, \nwhich have a keen interest in the Sundarbans, SDGs and specifically water \nquality. There are also talks with donors that are showing interest in citizen \nengagement, data-based decision making and collective action. We will \nleverage Water For People\u2019s Technical Support Unit and embedded staff in \nWest Bengal\u2019s state government and agreement with the Public Health and \nEngineering Department (in Birbhum and South 24 Parganas District) to \nensure government convergence in this program.  \nWe also propose to establish a multi-stakeholder platform that includes local \nCivil Society Organizations (CSOs), such as Oak Partners, in collaboration \nwith Water For People, PRASARI, and Akvo. The objective of this platform \nwould be to facilitate learning, sharing, implementation, and scaling up of \nthe interventions within and beyond the project locations. We propose to \nconduct an annual sharing workshop with our partners to provide a more \ndetailed update on the results and the processes followed to arrive at those \nresults.

(300 words):\nWater For People India has been working in West Bengal/ the Sundarbans \nfor 20+ years. PRASARI, our partner in this region for 10+ years, works \nclosely with local communities. PRASARI is currently working with Water \nFor People in four blocks in West Bengal, with communities on improving \nwater services, integrating water resources management, rainwater \nOak Application Form     14\nharvesting and building recharge structures. Akvo Foundation and Water For \nPeople have a decade-old partnership across the globe generating evidence \nfor program decision making. As program lead, Water For People India will \nlead project design, establish learning processes, liaise with Oak Foundation \nand relevant government departments, communicate regularly to all \nstakeholders, create policy and public facing communications, and submit \nrequired reports. We will also leverage our relationship with West Bengal\u2019s \nstate government to link these communities to government resources.  \nPRASARI will support on-ground implementation. PRASARI will focus on \nstrengthening social capital, building community capacity while \nincorporating traditional knowledge, facilitating aquifer mapping, water \nbudgeting, and water security planning. It will apply Ostrom\u2019s principles for \nmanagement of commons1, modifying as necessary and developing \nprocesses that can sustain momentum after the project has ended. In early \nstages of community interactions with local administration, PRASARI will act \nas a facilitator. Akvo is our technology and data partner, using appropriate \ntechnology to help us to report and build evidence. Local communities will \nuse Akvo\u2019s tools to collect data and information. Akvo will analyze data, \nsummarize findings, indicate trends, and develop data visualizations that \nWater For People and PRASARI will use for community engagement and to \npromote policy and model scale up. Akvo will work closely with Water For \nPeople to develop documentation useful for replicating and scaling up this \nprogram in similar contexts.  \nAdditionally, Water For People and Prasari will leverage their other donors \nworking in West Bengal that are interested in the climate-water-food nexus \nand/or livelihood development, such as Caterpillar Foundation and Ajim \nPremji Philanthropic Foundation.  \nWe will also establish a multi-stakeholder platform that includes local CSOs, \nsuch as Oak Foundation Partners, in collaboration with Water For People, \nPRASARI, and Akvo. The objective of this platform would be to facilitate \nlearning, sharing, implementation, and scaling up of the interventions within \nand beyond the project locations. \nWe will work with these stakeholders (Oak partners and non-Oak partners) \nfrom the very beginning to identify the operational villages and ensure \nintegration with other issues from the outset. The operational villages will be \nselected based on the vulnerability mapping of the Gram Panchayats (an \nadministrative unit that represents a cluster of villages). To conduct \nvulnerability mapping, a participatory tool will be used to assess 15 \nindicators distributed across four categories: Social, Climatic, Institutional \nand Economic.  \nSocial:  \ni. Ratio of Schedule Caste, Schedule Tribal & Other Backward Caste(s) ration \nto total population, \nii. Literacy Rate, \niii. Rate of migration to total no of families, \niv. Ratio of total number of toilet blocks to total number of households. \nClimate: \ni. Ratio of vulnerable river embankment to total embankment, \nii. Climatic disaster impact ratio (Ratio of number of disaster(s) in a \nOak Application Form     15\nparticular year with average number of climate disaster in last 10 years, \niii. Ratio of total submergent area to total area. \nInstitutional: \ni. Rate of migration to total number of families, \nii. Child mortality rate, \niii. Participation of women to the labor force, \niv. Average number of families dependent on drinking water from tube \nwells, \nv. Ratio of average distance from school, Panchayat and hospital to national \naverage. \nEconomic:  \ni. Ratio of mono-cropped and double cropped area, \nii. Ratio of waterborne diseases to non-communicable diseases, \niii. UN Household Dietary Diversity Score,  \niv. Average income from farm-based livelihoods and manufacturing + service \nsector.\nThese indications have been carefully outlined, agreed upon in public \nforums, and weighed uniformly. In addition, it is evaluated using a 5-point \nLikert scale, with the combined scores for each metric serving as the final \nevaluation. Gram Panchayats (GP) with a score of less than 2.5 are at risk of \nvulnerability. If a vulnerable GP is identified, all its corresponding revenue \nvillages will be included for implementation. As GPs are clusters of villages \nwithout further assessment, we incorporate all the revenue villages of a \nvulnerable GP for action.??", "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING \nThis section is twofold. Please tell us:\na) Monitoring and evaluation. How will you know if you are achieving your objectives? Please \ndescribe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is working. \nIf you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or \nconduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.\nb) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or \ntest through this grant.\n(300 words):\nThe project team (Water For People, PRASARI and Akvo) will employ \neffective MEL mechanisms (includes practices and tools) that provides a \nstructured approach to track project progress, assess impact, and foster \ncontinuous learning in a comprehensive and meaningful way.  The following \npoints describe our approach: \n- We will jointly design theory and pathways of change to create a logical \nframework to understand how our intended project activities will lead to the \ndesired outcomes and impact. This step is critical as it underpins every \naspect of the proposed project's implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. \nDuring the design step, we will develop results framework, a high-level \nOak Application Form     16\nstructure, that outlines the project's objectives, outcomes, indicators, \nactivities, inputs, and assumptions in a concise manner. \n- We will flesh-out an Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) framework from the \nproject results framework focused on how monitoring and evaluation will be \nconducted to track progress. We will develop a well-structured monitoring \nplan to transform the M&E framework into actionable steps by outlining the \nmethodologies, responsibilities, timelines, and resources required for \neffective project monitoring. At project inception, the team will outline data \nneeds and data use (for reporting, community, dissemination, advocacy, and \ndecision making) based on the M&E framework. To measure progress and \nimpact accurately, the project team will jointly design and implement \nbaseline and endline assessments. For concurrent monitoring, the team will \ndesign data collection instruments (qualitative and quantitative) aligned with \nthe indicators and ensure these are user-friendly and capture the required \ninformation accurately. Additionally, we will leverage on Water For People's \ncurrent resources, including internal tracking spreadsheets, biannual \nreports, and the Sustainable Services Checklist for water and sanitation. Our \napproach involves enhancing such existing data and processes to optimize \ntheir effectiveness for the proposed project.  \n- We will employ real-time (near real-time) progress tracking of key \nperformance indicators and milestones to gain insights into how the project \nis advancing toward its set targets across the time and space of the project \ncontext. We will use technology and data to provide up-to-date information \nabout the project's status, enabling swift decision-making and adjust \nstrategies/activities based on real-time data and learning. Akvo will enable a \ncentralized web-based platform to monitor project data and prepare a \npredictive analysis model/simulation for forecasting conditions that impact \nwater sources and make informed decisions about the sustainability of their \nwater sources.  \n- We will integrate Data-Driven Insights into project operations to conduct \nrealistic assessment of project achievements and challenges and incorporate \na learning component in the project plan. These insights will reveal trends, \npatterns, and areas of improvement in the project.  We will also use these \ninsights to develop adaptive strategies and refine our approach during \nproject implementation. These may include insights that help us assess what \nelements of our interventions are working and if there is a need to \nimprove/change project activities and/or intervention logic. The project team \nwill utilize appropriate analytical techniques to derive and present insights \nusing compelling visualizations to enhance understanding and communicate \nproject findings to project stakeholders in a clear and accessible manner.  \nIn a broader sense, these monitoring insights will contribute to the collective \nlearning of all project stakeholders, including the project donor. Additionally, \nthe project team will create learning documentation to be shared with Oak \nFoundation partners both within the current project area and in other \nregions. \nWe will jointly conduct the baseline and endline assessments.  Akvo will \ndevelop a web-based platform to track project data and also prepare a \npredictive analysis model/simulation for forecasting conditions that impact \nwater sources and make informed decisions about the sustainability of their \nwater sources. We will also build on Water For People\u2019s existing tools, such \nas the Sustainable Services Checklist for water and sanitation which includes \nOak Application Form     17\n11 indicators with specific criteria to meet, particularly for Water Resources \nManagement.  \nWe anticipate that by adopting a participatory approach, villages will teach \nall partners about the challenges they face and solutions they may have \nalready attempted. We will apply these learnings to demonstrate models for \ninterventions. Learnings in the form of reports and policy briefs will be \nshared with Block, District and State administration officials to identify the \nimplementation issues and to gain buy-in on successful models. Learnings in \nthe form of blogs, success stories will be shared on different social media \nplatforms. Water For People will also share data with World Water Quality \nAlliance and Water Point Data Exchange and results with wider audiences as \nrelevant such as during World Water Week and the All Systems Connect \nsymposium. \nWe will create a culture of using data for decision making and ensure \ncommunity engagement and active participation in water security planning \nby implementing the following strategies:? \n\u2022At the project\u2019s outset, we will engage community members to \ncollaboratively design the water security plans within the project's \nregions. This approach ensures ownership, cultivates awareness, and \nfamiliarizes them with the nuances of the planning process. Our intent \nis to create a culture of using data to make decisions and align \nincentives (improving water security, lives and livelihoods) to sustain \nthe habit beyond the tenure of a project.? \n\u2022We will ensure the project data about the water security planning \nprocess is transformed into simple, clear and actionable information \nthat local communities and their governments (GP, block and district) \ncan understand and utilize to make key water management decisions. \nWater user communities will be involved in the design of data \ncollection and analysis process (what data to collect, who would do the \nanalysis, in what form the analyzed data will be available to make \ndecisions). Based on the user feedback, we will create a set of \nquantitative and qualitative tools. Local communities will be trained to \nfield test the tools, give feedback, and help improve the tools. We will \nalso engage members of local communities (Self Help Groups and other \ncommunity-based organizations) to collect the actual data, be involved \nduring the analysis and present the data back to their fellow \ncommunity members.? \n\u2022We will ensure communities are actively involved in the periodic (most \nlikely annual) updates of water security plans to ensure that the plans \nremain relevant, effective, and aligned with the evolving needs and \npriorities of the community.??", "10.

Summarise the project\u2019s ultimate goal(s) (maximum 200 words):\n( NOT REQUIRED FOR CORE SUPPORT GRANTS)\nThe project\u2019s ultimate goal to enable identified groups of people in Sunderban to \ncome together to diagnose their vulnerabilities , articulate aspiration  and avenue \nof change and produce a plan for acting upon vulnerabilities as well as achieving \nhighest standard of cooperation among collaborating organisations, leading to \ndeep institutionalisation of values of partnership and commitment for the \ncommunity-led approaches to development.  \nIn India, Sunderbans lies in the vast delta on the Bay of Bengal formed by the super \nconfluence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and the Meghna rivers. The place has always \nearned a special interest in the world map because of its uniqueness of the Mangrove \nforests and the lifestyle of the local inhabitants. People have been mostly dependent \non agriculture and fishing. Owing to recent climatic changes, there is evidence of \nlivelihood dearth adding to increasing vulnerability amongst all sections of the \ninhabitants. Interventions and support from the various local level organizations, \ngovernment schemes have remained detrimental to the development of this area. \nDay-by-day, people are becoming increasingly dependent on immediate support \nrather than making themselves more reliant and capacitated by participating in \nsustainable processes of growth and development.\nAmong the 15 Blocks in the South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, Pathar \nPratima is one of the largest blocks and known as one of the critical blocks in terms \nof adverse social issues. The various publications and researches have pointed \ntowards the increasing adversities related to human trafficking, increasing \nmigration, insufficient alternatives to livelihood, frequent disasters in this block \nleading to severe adverse consequences on all section of inhabitants.\nHerambagopalpur Gram Panchayat is located in the northern side of the \nPatharpratima Block. The size of the area is about 868.3 hectares. It comprises 4 \nmain villages, namely, Heramba Gopalpur, Dakshin Kashinagar, Kuemuri and Purba \nSurendranagar. Kuemuri in the Dakshin Kashinagar in the South-East surrounds \nHeramba Gopalpur along the Matla river. A total of 17 Sansads are included in these \n4 villages.\nDue to its deltaic location, the river network forms the major transport system of \nthis area and people are dependent on the river both for transportation and \nlivelihood. Being located in the deltaic region, the rivers here are tidal in nature. The \narea remains flooded mostly during the rainy season and the situation worsens at \ntimes of natural calamities. Breaching of river embankments, river bank erosion are \nthus very common phenomena here. All these natural calamities have an adverse \neffect on the people residing there. Remoteness and undeveloped infrastructural \nfacilities add to irreparable damages of life and property.   MUKTI has been working \nfor the underprivileged people in the Sundarban area since 2003. Interventions at \nPatharpratima Block by Mukti started almost 5-6 years back. More than 70 students \nin the Herambagopalpur GP are being benefited through the Mukti Support School \nCentres. The women empowerment programme focussing on developing \nentrepreneurship skills through the MCDF project includes almost 1200 women \nfrom the GP. Mukti aims to continue ongoing such initiatives to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment for these people.", "4. GEOGRAPHY": "5.List the major countries where your activities take place.

To prevent any hindrance in regular project activities, \nmajority of the donors of Mukti offer to transfer the whole amount after which \nutilisation is shared. This helps in meeting the gap in the other projects which \ntransfers the funds almost like giving reimbursements to the organization after \ncompletion of the activities.\nThe operation cost of each project is maintained with the line time and involves a \nmajor part of the budget. All operational costs requests are raised from time to time \nfor seeking approval of the Secretary and thereafter expenses are made.

Face to face meetings, presentations \nand practical knowledge sharing, exploring scopes of fundraising through \ncrowdfunding platforms are commonly practiced in Mukti.\nMukti believes in utilizing the majority of the amount for the activities rather than \nmaintaining a huge amount for contingency.

They decided to involve the educated and energetic local \nyouth in the various community development projects. These youths gradually \nstarted developing the vision and finally laid the foundation of MUKTI. The local \npeople supported them in this quench and the services continued and grew every \nyear paving its way for a sustainable development for these marginalised \npeople.  The commendable job by the team has been broadcasted by \u2018BBC \nWorldwide service\u2019 and the \u2018Dadagiri\u2019 show.

The work of the organisation is visible in various national and \ninternational platforms and in state newspapers.  Today, MUKTI has been able to \nspread its wings in almost every state and country. Hundreds of volunteers have \nbecome associated with us and are supporting our noble cause. Our volunteers are \ninvolved with providing expertise knowledge to fund raising and also to work with \nthe people directly in the field. Educational institutions have reached out to Mukti \nfor placements and internships for building a strong foundation among their \nstudents entitled with social commitment and values.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nMukti is already developing strategy to explore new geographical areas and \nexploring feasibility of new initiatives as per community requirement. The \norganization will be expanding to other districts in West Bengal in the next few \nmonths.

Mukti believes in maximizing \nquality initiatives which will directly impact the beneficiaries. And to learn from \nthem how projects may be implemented as all the communities are dynamic in \nnature and have their own individualities. It is important for us to develop strategy \naccordingly. The current strategy also involves capacitating the team for better \nunderstanding of the realities and efficient outcome. In order to get timely outputs, \nresponsibilities are well decentralized amongst the team members and regular \nmeetings and field visits are a continuous process of the strategy. This is not only at \nthe ground level but also at the Board level where each Trustee has definite function \nto do in their own roles. Mukti invites volunteers and interns and respects their \ninterest in social work. They are involved and assigned with specific tasks as per \ntheir expertise, interest and convenience which helps in the development of strong \nvalues among the youngsters.

It has been our strategy to upkeep these \nand share all updates about the organisation from time to time.\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nMukti is working towards an enabling environment for the community people so that \nthese people are capacitated in such a way that they are able to identify their \nvulnerabilities and address them to reduce their vulnerability. In the process of \ndoing that, Mukti has helped the community people to identify their own problems \nand people have been able to come up with solutions related to livelihood, dearth in \nresources, disaster preparedness, gender equality, education, health, adolescent \nproblems and at the same time have also been able to identify ways to mitigate them \nfrom their own levels. These problems are related to agriculture, fishing and honey \ncollection and how improvement can be brought into them. Community people have \ndiscussed about gender discrimination, evidence of drop out among school children, \nabsence of basic health facilities in the communities, especially for women, impact \nof frequent disasters and how important is disaster preparedness essential in the \ncommunity along with problems of deforestation and was to address them. As \nobserved by Mukti, it is crucial to develop the insight among the community people \nto identify these as problems and strengthen their capacities to help them address \nthem.\nFor  fulfilling the objectives of the project, Mukti has also identified lots of \nopportunities. Firstly, there is ample scope to involve youths and volunteers from \nthe communities having understanding of the dynamics of the  community and \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\nmaking them learn and develop skills to lead the community development \ninitiatives.  Secondly, this project creates opportunities for networking \npartnerships among other grass root organizations and resource organizations \nwhich has a great scope for learning and understanding issues better.  Thirdly, the \nproject has a good scope of adapting to the community needs rather than creating \nany unnecessary imposition on the community people. This is a great opportunity \nto understand the socio-economic-cultural contexts of the community and \naccordingly plan with them the future steps.\nWhile working in the community, Mukti has observed certain challenges as well. \nFirstly, it has been noticed that the community people are very much influenced by \nthe local politicians in each and every step. All schemes, provisions are very much \ninfluenced by the politicians and the community is divided into \u2013 privileged and the \nunderprivileged. Secondly, frequent disasters have hampered the functioning of \nthe community severely. Everytime, such disasters have been havoc and people \nhave lost everything. It is very difficult for the community people to re-start, even \nthough that becomes difficult because of the severe financial crunch. Thirdly, the \ncurrent pandemic situation has not improved overall in the rural areas. People \nrestrain outsiders from coming inside, many have lost jobs, demoralized and \nuncertain when the situation will improve and if there will be any scope to get \nback to work. The pandemic has jeopardized the families leading to precipitating \nother adverse social issues. Fourthly, the capacity of the community people in \nterms of motivation and willingness has severely been hit by the various calamities \nand other factors in the community.

Even though \nyou may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the \nproposed grant. (300 words)\nKamonohashi Project was founded in 2002 in Japan, aiming at combatting \nhuman trafficking of children for commercial sexual exploitation in the world. \nIt started the projects in Cambodia where the child trafficking for commercial \nsexual exploitation was rampant, and it focused (1) to build community-based \nfactory for the most vulnerable populations in rural Cambodia not to take the \nrisk of unsafe migration, and (2) to support police training to strengthen the \nprosecution against traffickers. With the gradual shift of the issue, Kamo \nembarked on the global field study and concluded to support India in 2012. \nKamo\u2019s support in India aims to strengthen access to justice by the survivors \nof human trafficking through systems strengthening approach. Kamo \nfacilitates breaking polarization in development debates through dialogue and \ndeep listening. Kamo also strongly believes in leadership development in \nsurvivors and among organizational founders and second line leaders to \nstrengthen the ecosystem of the civil society. In 2022, after three-year internal \ndialogue, Kamo decided to shift from mission-driven to the principle-based \norganization, and the new principle, \u201cDignity for All\u201d, was approved by its \nGeneral Assembly. Key achievements are;\n1. Kamo handed over the Cambodia Programme to build further social \nleadership programme using the community-based factory. This process \nwas handled professionally with financial transaction, and this type of \nbusiness succession was of a rare case in the Japanese social sector;\n2. Kamo built, nurtured and supported Tafteesh Programme since 2013, \nand Tafteesh received the Stop Slavery Collaboration Award from the \nThomson Reuters Foundation in 2022;\nKamo is supported by 14,999 subscribed supporters as of May 2023. The \nfundraising model of Kamo is recognized as successful and unique in \nJapanese civil societies. The donations from those individual supporters have \nbeen enabling Kamo to design and support strategic programmes based on \nthe contextual needs in India.\n5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? \nHow will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and \ndecide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nSecondary Research on Global Prevention of Human Trafficking (Balu et al, \n2021) under the last phase of Tafteesh revealed that (1) prevention of human \ntrafficking is defined in a highly varied manner, depending upon the approach \nto human trafficking, (2) vulnerability to trafficking may show a stronger \ncorrelation with relative poverty rather than absolute poverty, (3) \ncommunities and systems sustain vulnerability through permissive \nOak Application Form     7\nenvironment that prevent quick identification of victims, and (4) the research \ncalls for ecological, holistic and multidisciplinary approaches, reiterating that \nsingle-focused interventions will not impact the overall vulnerability of \npopulations that are at risk of trafficking (Attachment 3).\n\u201cPreventing Trafficking: Sustainable developmental solutions to combat \ntrafficking (Change Mantras, 2021)\u201d under the last phase of Tafteesh also \nclarified that (1) there is no cogent policy on prevention of trafficking either \nin India or other parts of the world, (2) most anti trafficking programmes focus \non responses to trafficking, rather than pre-emptively seeking to mitigate or \nprevent exploitations or violations that lead to trafficking, and (3) \ninterventions are largely community based and making parents more \nresponsible to prevent their children from being trafficked, and they lack the \nclarity of responsibility of duty-bearers such as district administration, \npanchayat and police in prevention (Attachment 4).\nWest Bengal is reportedly one of the most affected states by human trafficking \nand has been a high prevalence state according to the National Crime Records \n(Attachment C). Existing anti trafficking policies, laws or programmes, by the \ngovernment or NGOs do not seem to have created any dent on the prevalence. \nAnti trafficking interventions have long focused on responsive initiatives - \nrehabilitation of survivors, reparation and penalisation of offenders. Even \nthough all instruments on human trafficking to address prevention, there are, \nin fact, very few policies, laws or programmes that are focused on prevention, \nnot only in West Bengal, but across India.\nTafteesh is one of the largest and most significant civil society led anti \ntrafficking initiative in India today, that has mobilised and organised survivors \nof sex trafficking in North and South 24 Parganas in West Bengal and have \nsucceeded in establishing survivor led initiatives in claiming rehabilitation and \nprotection services from local governments, administration and health service \nproviders, claiming compensation and assert rights to accountability from law \nenforcement agencies, legal services authorities and the judicial system in \nprosecution of traffickers. This led to the question - now that community based \norganisations and survivor collectives in these two districts that have become \nempowered to design and take action, how would it address the gap in absence \nof any preventative measures on human trafficking?\nThe Preventing Trafficking research indicated distinguishable patterns and \ndifferences in opinion on effective prevention between youth and adults, state \nduty bearers and common people. The research also identified information \ngaps in areas of labour trafficking, trafficking in men and boys, trafficking in \ntransgender persons as well as underlying factors that explain higher \nvulnerability amongst people from scheduled caste and Muslims[1].\nThe opportunities emerged through the last two phases to build on this \nprevention piece is the survivor collectives, people who are victims of labour \ntrafficking seeking support services, the enhanced capacities of the NGOs, the \nwide network of Tafteesh which include established connections with the \nlegal, law enforcement and other relevant departments. This request from Oak \nFoundation is to enable Tafteesh to build on and implement diverse and unique \nprevention approaches relevant to local contexts based on rights-based and \ncommunity-based initiatives in West Bengal.\nOak Application Form     8\n[1] That Muslims and SC have a disproportionate vulnerability was claimed \nby social workers, activists and survivors who participated in the research, \nbased on their own experiences, data and observations.", "6.

How will this phase ensure that the survivor groups play a larger role in \ndefining strategy and interventions undertaken by Tafteesh. Please highlight \nthe strategic approaches and processes through which the survivor groups will \nhave enhanced participation in designing and implementing the prevention \napproaches.\n(a) Tafteesh member organisations will conduct refresher trainings and \nworkshops with survivors to help them understand Tafteesh and a programme, \nits goals, objectives and activities, (b) share the monthly or quarterly \ncumulative reports with them to increase their understanding, (c) the \nProgramme Manager gets workshops done with the survivors collectives to \nidentify their critiques and recommendations, and lastly, (d) each member \norganisation shall implement the monitoring recommendations that come from \nsurvivors from these workshops.\n \n2. As the Anti-Trafficking legislation currently pending in parliament, what will \nbe the TMCs strategy to ensure that all groups (survivors, sex workers etc.) \nvoices are factored in the legislation? This we understand is a larger objective \nof TMC and ties into the prevention domain. So therefore the application \nshould outline the broad strategies on this.\nThe three broad strategies: (a) support ILFAT to raise demand for legal reform \nwith funding to build the narrative, (b) support allies to get domestic funding \nto renew litigation in the Supreme Court using research on impact of ITPA and \nOak Application Form     14\nsection 370, the litigation may be filed by any of the survivors, and (c) support \nVimukthi to establish to its action in Andhra Pradesh on co-holding sex \nworkers' rights agenda with the agenda of trafficked victims, and support them \nand the state government to take it to the centre.\n \n3. What is the arrangement and why such a mode of engagement is followed? \nPlease address this question in the Additional Questions \u2013 Section 11.\nBased on the risk assessment studies done by four legal and consulting firms \nin India in 2018 and 2019, Kamo\u2019s Board decided to hire all team members as \nfull-time consultants through third party payroll service. This has been \npracticed by multiple international foundations as well as UN agencies for \ndecades, and this is a part of Kamo\u2019s risk-mitigation strategies when it does \nnot have any registered office in India. Strategic Alliance Management \nServices Ltd. (https://www.sams.co.in/) is the contract holder of all Kamo India \nteam members, and Kamo and SAMS are in this arrangement since 2020.\n \n4. About Tafteesh Organizational Mission and History\nTafteesh was formed in a response to its action research conducted in 2013, \nand it is the platform of 6 social impact organisations, 2 legal teams, 12 \nmember survivor collectives, Change Mantras (CM) for programme \ndirectorship and Kamonohashi Project (Kamo) as fund manager.  The platform \nhas grown from 3 organisations and Kamonohashi to the current size with the \nannual budget increased from USD 45,680 to USD 447,335. Survivors are at \nthe centre of the programme, and 246 survivors of trafficking as of May 2023 \nplays the role of collaborator, feedback provider, monitor and advisor to the \nTafteesh Management Committee, as well as co-implementor and co-planner \nwith grassroots NGOs and legal teams.\nTafteesh is a Justice Programme for and with survivors of human trafficking, \nincluding children (girls and boys) and adults (women and men), for sexual \nexploitation and forced labour that aims to provoke state and national \ngovernments of India to develop policies, laws and systems and to allocate \nresources for rights of survivors and to protect rights of communities \nvulnerable to trafficking and exploitation in migration. For this mission, \nfollowings are the key achievements of Tafteesh;\n\u2022Development of Tafteesh\u2019s prevention strategy, theory of change \n(Attachment B) and objectives, based on the community-based research \nconducted by survivors and social activists;\n\u2022Stigma reduction in survivors, survivors have organised themselves into \norganisations and have formed India\u2019s first survivors\u2019 exclusive \nleadership forum called Indian Leadership Forum Against Trafficking \n(ILFAT) in 2019;\n\u2022Empowerment of CBOs in anti-trafficking programming. CBOs are \nskilled with case-management based practice, which enables CBOs to \nhold district administrations accountable. CBOs are also skilled to \nprovide legal services to survivors both for victim compensation and \nprosecution of traffickers, making legal services available from DLSA \nand private lawyers, escalating dereliction of duties or faulty \ninvestigations in cases to High Court using protest petitions or appeal.\nOak Application Form     15\n \n5. Please state the factors behind prevalence of trafficking.\nIndia\u2019s policy on rehabilitation is ineffective, with poor rates of trauma-\nrecovery, economic security or social assimilation or protection from stigma. \nThis systemic neglect alienates survivors from the State. Because India does \nnot have a rehabilitation policy nationally or in any state, the role and \naccountability of duty bearers - Panchayats, administration, health \ndepartments remains fuzzy. This leaves survivors vulnerable to further \nviolence in families and communities, and results in domestic violence and re-\ntrafficking. Investigations of cases of human trafficking are handled by the \ngeneral police stations with limited resources and structural support for \ninterstate investigations. The chain of crime is not investigated or established \nleading to poor case for prosecution. The non functioning of Anti Human \nTrafficking Units leads to poor conviction rates to deter trafficking crimes \nacross states over years. Poor rate of access of compensations by survivors is \na result of lack of the implementation of victim compensation scheme by Legal \nServices Authorities across states. Due to the lack of prevention policy \nthroughout the country, the roles and responsibilities of government duty-\nbearers to prevent human trafficking remains unclear to all. Lack of \ninvestment in survivors leadership in the sector lead to lack of inclusion of \nsurvivors as active agents in designing, implementing and monitoring \ninterventions contributes to the fragmentation and also results in lack of \nownership, sustainability and alignment of anti trafficking approaches with \nneeds of communities vulnerable to trafficking.\n \n6.

Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nNCAS is a premiere policy research institution in India. NCAS was formed in 1992 \nby leading academics, jurists and social activists. since its inception, the Board of \nDirectors is led by people of eminence with Justice P. N. Bhagwati, (former Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court of India) as the founding President, followed by noted \nplaywright Vijay Tendulkar and Dr. Aruna Roy, among others. Over the years, NCAS \nhas gained recognition as a premiere institution in policy research and governance \nin India and global south. NCAS has over 29 years of experience in capacity \ndevelopment, knowledge creation, networking in public policy and governance in \nIndia and internationally. It has trained leaders in academia, journalism, policy think \ntanks in India and 30 countries in the world. NCAS believes proper policy and its \ngovernance can create huge differences in the lives of millions of people. NCAS \npioneered the idea of people centered advocacy, enabling marginalized communities \nto participate in the process of policy advocacy.\nSince last 29 years, NCAS is actively engaged in capacity development, research \nand knowledge creation, campaign support, social movement and knowledge \nnetworking and media with a particular focus on the policy and governance from \nthe lens of the marginalized.\nThe \u2018Advocacy Internship Program\u2019, for building capacities of youth, was launched \nin 1999.

Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nThe scenario of the contemporary socio-political environment mandates that more \nthan management and consultancy skills, a studied approach towards social \nchange shall prove to be more beneficial. In this light the National Center for \nAdvocacy Studies (NCAS) will prove to be the perfect agent to advance both the \nrequisites of the contemporary scenario:\n1.

What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nWith gaping problems consisting of threats to natural and human capital it was \nclear that any action by the formulation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \nhas to be formulated to ensure protection and thriving of humanity and the \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nenvironment. \nSeeking accountability from the system has now become the most challenging task \nfor the civil society actors. The changing political scenario has tried hard to silence \nthe voices from the margins, the current economic crisis in the country affects the \nmarginalized communities the most, discrimination, and denial of social justice \nhave become more pressing, giving a push to the civil society in the direction of \npeople-centered and people-monitored advocacy for accountability of egalitarian \nState actions.\nOne of the thematic, education is the one we have been focusing on in \nMaharashtra, the New Education Policy of 2020 which has now moved into the \nimplementation phase, has been under heavy criticism while the policy seems to \nprovide a wide range of opportunity for students, there is still a huge gap between \nthe ground realities and the implementation plan. While one of the major \nchallenges that has engulfed us is the pandemic, which has pushed some of the \nmost vulnerable sections to the margins even further. Children have dropped out \nof school; loss of learning is one of the major concerns in this era where digital \nlearning has taken over. A number of children have fallen in the cracks due to lack \nof opportunity. With the state wide networks and other civil society groups, there \nhas been a constant effort to highlight the plight of these children by constantly \nengaging with the government agency to not overlook the ground realities, one of \nthe major struggles is towards reopening of schools, the government is yet to take \na clear stand on the same.   Demanding accountability from the government \nespecially while accessing the right to food is yet another major problem especially \nin the remote tribal areas where access to services is still very low. The systems \nand structures that need to be in place to ensure that access to food is not \nhampered are also in a limbo, the vigilance committees formulated under Public \nDistribution System still continue to be either dysfunctional or have not been \nformulated. These committees play a key role from within the village to ensure \nquality control and equal distribution. However, the lack of these committees or \nthe dysfunctional nature is due to the lack of will within the system to ensure \ntransparency and accountability. NCAS has been engaged in creating awareness, \nenabling communities to seek accountability from the government in two districts, \nhere the communities being close knit usually do not raise questions against their \nown members who are in position of power, that\u2019s a major hurdle. It is evident that \nmalnutrition became a very serious concern hence seeking accountability for food \nsecurity is a very key concern.\nIn terms of opportunities- National and local networks are of a great support to \namplify the issues\nAt state lever there are still avenues for negotiation and dialogue with the \ngovernment.\nSome of the major challenges is the ongoing pandemic that takes over all other \nissues and has slowed down negotiations. The current dispensation also leaves \nvery little room for rights of people. In such a climate the only hope is to uphold \nthe democratic rights given in the constitution of India.", "7.

We \nembedded our model locally in India and other South Asian jurisdictions \nstriving to deliver our mission to ensure access to justice for all in pursuit of a \njust society.\nCore achievements:\n\u20222023: iProbono India was awarded the Children Champions Award by \nthe Delhi Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) in \nrecognition of our work to ensure justice for all. More details here: \nhttps://i-probono.com/case-study/iprobono-wins-childrens-champions-\naward-2023/\n\u20222018 to date: Our successful pilot \u2018Accelerate\u2019 Program provides sub-\ngrants t projects in India and Bangladesh.

Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nProblem statement: Our work in South Asia over the past 10 years has shown \nus that despite sustained efforts by both government and civil society, access \nto justice in the current economic, social and political scenario in India \nremains extremely unequal. A two-tiered justice system allows only a \nprivileged minority to understand the law and access justice. While state-led \nlegal aid provisions and other legal recourse mechanisms do exist, not every \nmarginalised community/individual (women, children, survivors of abuse, \nreligious minorities, migrant workers and the disabled to name a few) has easy \naccess to these mechanisms. Poor legal literacy and/or the lack of awareness \nof one\u2019s rights under the law further hinders any meaningful engagement with \nthe justice system. As a result, legal representation remains beyond the reach \nof poor and vulnerable communities. We also note that grassroots \norganisations representing the interests of these vulnerable communities \nsimilarly suffer from a lack of quality and affordable legal advice. And finally, \nprimary stakeholders within the justice system (for example, public \nprosecutors, the police, lawyers, and so on) often lack nuanced knowledge of \nthe laws that serve to protect the rights of these communities.\nTheory of Change: iProbono\u2019s pathway to real change is based in a law and \ndevelopment paradigm that ensures the most vulnerable communities in our \nsociety have access to and a voice within the legal system. Our model of \nholistic counsel engages and combines a series of tools including litigation, \ndirect legal advice, professional development, outreach and community \neducation, research advocacy and policy, and capacity building. Storytelling \nOak Application Form     7\nto change hearts and minds cross cuts across our tools and the concept of \n\u2018comprehensive care\u2019 provides us with an additional tool to go one step \nbeyond the legal. Alongside our capacity building and litigation support, we \nhave also provided our partner organisations across India with emergency \nhunger relief funding during the Covid pandemic, or psychosocial support \nour clients who are survivors of sexual abuse in India or the ability to \nevacuate and support of 120 at risk women from Afghanistan when the \nTaliban seized power in 2021.\nThis holistic justice model thus aims to both prevent rights violations, seek \nsolutions when violations have occurred, and catalyse deeper systemic \nchange. With the Oak Foundation\u2019s support, we intend to deepen our \nengagement in each of these areas with selected sub-grantees in West \nBengal: 2 carefully selected partner organisations to deliver holistic access \nto justice to vulnerable communities in West Bengal.\nWe have held an initial consultation with a core group of 8 organisations \ncurrently supported by the Oak Foundation to gain insight in to the type of \naccess justice issues faced by communities. As part of the proposal, we have \nincluded an initial scoping period to allow our internal team to apply the \nstated theory of change in the selection of sub-grantee organisations as well \nas in the process of supporting these organisations to plan delivery.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion underpin our theory of change and an active \ninternal Equality Law team advises on how we inform each of our programs \nfrom choice of delivery partner to thematic issues covered in our work. \niProbono intends to monitor implementation in this area during the grant \nperiod.", "6.

The \nadult-child axis of power is a difficult power gradient to engage with by both adults \nand children. This becomes even more complicated in case of adolescents where \nissues about choice and consent assume very different nuances.\nAgency in children and adolescents is also strongly related to gender identity and \nexpression and is shaped by gender norms and expectations. The project hopes to \ncapacitate implementing organisations to acknowledge  agency of children and \nadolescents and appreciate the role that gender plays in hindering and facilitating \nparticipation of children and women so that their opinions and choices are reflected \nadequately within community voices and action.", "4.

This referred \nto Praajak\u2019s core competency in working with adolescents at the cusp of child \nprotection and gender equity and its belief that adolescent and youth are best \npositioned to lead efforts for social and cultural transformation and shape a world \nof empathy, esteem and acceptance. Praajak felt the most validated as it worked to \nfacilitate boys and girls to transform their worlds by transforming themselves first \nand fostered a network of vibrant community spaces that are designed and led by \nyouth. These spaces were promoted as places for exploration, agency and \nbehavioural change.\nThe strategy that was adopted was called the 3C Model which referred to \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\nCollectives (collectivising adolescents), Community (advocating with and \nmobilising the community in favour of the rights of children and adolescents) and \nCampus (developing leadership programmes for young people so they can set up \ntheir own projects)\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nThe problems we are addressing are chiefly around   understanding community led \nactions, is the meaning of effective participation and revisiting boundaries \nbetween the community and the organization. Simultaneously we are also looking \nat how the concept of child agency can be integrated into child rights/protection \nwork and how by addressing masculinities related issues we can include boys and \nmen as allies in our efforts to assume gender equity.\nPraajak believes that any capacity development should be built on the foundation \nof the existing strengths of trainees and make use of their experiences. This will \nmean any capacity building will use both experiential training and handholding \nduring implementation as major methodologies.\nCommunication and appropriate messaging have emerged as a major challenge for \npartner organization and there is a legacy of organisational interaction with \nstakeholders which needs to be tackled in a way that harm can be reduced for the \norganisation\u2019s current operations.\nA comprehensive advocacy workshop emphasising needs to be conducted for all \nstaff in one or more phases as is suitable to the organisation.\nThe following areas will need to be addressed:\n\u2022The difference between advocacy on one hand and community mobilisation, \npublic relations and IEC/BCC on the other.\n\u2022Formulation of SMART advocacy adjectives\n\u2022Stakeholder Analysis and Messaging\n\u2022A framework for organisational strategy regarding stakeholder \ncommunication.\n\u2022Additionally, a tool called the CCC-NERO will be introduced that will help to \nenhance the skills of social workers of partner organizations on the \nfrontline.\nChild Marriage, Child Trafficking and Child Labour in terms of Root Causes, \nIdentifying Vulnerabilities, Legislation Custody vs Agency, Response \nSystems\nGender and Social Development- Concept of Gender, Gender Norms and Roles, \nPatriarchy, Gender based Discrimination and Violence, Gender Equity\nDocumentation-Understanding Narratives and Storytelling, Understanding \nAudience, Documentation Skills The overall recommendation is the following:\n1.

Since then, the organization has grown both \nin scope & geographical coverage and has expanded to most parts of India \nreaching millions of children in both rural and urban areas across 20 states \nand 3 union territories. Pratham has grown to address a gamut of educational \nproblems \u2013 pre-school education, learning support to both in-school and out of \nschool children and youth, mainstreaming of out-of-school  children, computer \nliteracy, vocational training for youth and special programs for vulnerable and \nworking children. Pratham Skilling is the vocational training arm of Pratham, \nestablished  in 2005 with the aim of empowering youth (age 18-35 years) from \neconomically disadvantaged backgrounds by creating avenues for them to \nattain employability and/or entrepreneurship. Since 2005, we have trained \n1,76,000+ youth in industry specific trades and placed 75-80% youth in jobs \nin automotive, hospitality, healthcare, electrical, beauty & construction trades \namong our 2000+ industry partners at our 130+ centers spread across 16 \nstates. We also run entrepreneurship development projects and have \nsupported 5,300+ entrepreneurs.\nThe following are some of Pratham\u2019s key achievements:\n1.Blended learning approach: Effective blended learning project in \n1000 communities since 2016. 8000 tablets and 1000 Raspberry Pis \ndistributed, impacting 60,000 children and 6000 youth, including 2000 \ndrop-outs.\n2.Hybrid Skilling Innovation: Pratham pivoted to a remote-contact self-\nlearning and virtual-training model in 20,000+ villages during the \nlockdown leading to employment for 32,000+ youth from Oct 2020-\nMarch 2022.\n3.Post-Placement Tracking: To ensure continued retention in \nemployment, Pratham reaches out to each trainee every 3 months, for a \nperiod of 1 year, collecting 110+ data points tracking their employment \nstatus and need for further placement assistance.

(600 words):\nThe communities of North Bengal live in precarious conditions, highly \ndependent on employment provided by tea-plantation owners. Low wages, \nseasonal employment cycle, plantation owners\u2019 restrictions and lack of \nalternative income-earning opportunities are some of the key challenges \nfaced by these communities. To understand the region in more detail, a \nteam of 4 Pratham members, including program leadership visited \nSoongachi, Naxalbari, Kakarvita & Cooch Behar tea estates in March \n2022. The team interacted with the sarpanch & gram-panchayat members \nand conducted 3 focused group discussions with the youth & their parents \non their current employment situation, aspirations and challenges. Most \nof the youth majorly belonged to SC/ST sections with someone from their \nfamily working in a tea garden. Some key insights from their discussions:\n1. Current Employment Status: While some youth were still studying, \nmajority of them had completed their 12th and graduation and were \nnot engaged in any employment activity. \n2. Aspiration: The youth showed disinterest towards working in tea-\ngardens and were looking for other job opportunities. However, they \nlacked exposure about jobs available in different sectors, how to access \nthem and industry requirements. There was a clear need for guidance \nand mentorship for these youth. \n3. Willingness to migrate for training & job: Majority of these youth \nshowed willingness to join a vocational training course near their \ncommunities and migrate for a job opportunity within Bengal. \nHospitality, Automotive 4W, Healthcare and electrical trades were \nsome of the most chosen preferences of these youth. \n4. Workforce demand: The tea-gardens being a tourist attraction, there is \nmassive demand for hospitality staff. Interaction with a couple of \nautomotive showrooms and service dealerships and resorts reflected \nthe need for skilled staff within this region. Year 2 onwards electrical \ntrade will also be introduced based on a need assessment study \nconducted with industry partners. \n \nAnother interaction with Adivasi Vikas Parishad and SPAN NGO further \nemphasized livelihood related challenges, trafficking issues, mobility and \nconnectivity problems, education and healthcare related issues within the \nregion. While these interactions clearly indicate lack of awareness on \nvocational training led employment pathways, Pratham will conduct a \ndetailed need assessment survey both in the community and with industry \npartners in North Bengal to understand aspirations and needs in greater \ndepth. The survey will also capture potential job opportunities within tea \nmanufacturing units. Insights from this detailed survey will feed into the \nprogram design. \n \nOak Application Form     9\nBased on Pratham\u2019s experience of 17 years training over 1,75,000 rural \nyouth across India, we propose  a  community-focused youth training \ninitiative in Hospitality and Automotive 4W trades in Year 1 and Electrical \ntrade in Year 2 of the engagement with the youth.\n Following are the key components of the programs:\n \nBuilding Awareness : Mentors will interact with youth, panchayat and \ncommunity leaders spreading awareness on career pathways through \nvocational training focusing primarily on communities working in the tea \ngarden areas of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri, Coochbehar, \nUttar Dinajpur and Dakshin Dinajpur districts of North Bengal region. \nGroup meetings, skill-melas, video testimonials of Pratham\u2019s alumni will be \nleveraged to build awareness. At this stage, youth will be enrolled in Level \n1 -7-day long self-placed digital courses giving exposure to 7 different \nindustry trades and potential job opportunities within them. \nTraining \u2013 Conducted in a hybrid approach, the core training includes two \ncomponents namely, Level 2 (virtual sessions) and Level 3 (in-person \npractical sessions). The entire training spans roughly 45-60 days. \nJob Placements- Trained youth will be oriented with available job \nopportunities within Hospitality and Automotive sectors. Pratham \nnegotiates with its placement partners for salaries and additional benefits- \nfood, accommodation and transportation allowance for its trainees. Youth \nwill be guided throughout the interview and joining process. \nPost-Placement Tracking: To ensure continued retention in employment, \nPratham reaches out to each trainee every 3 months, for a period of 1 year, \ncollecting 110+ data points tracking their employment status and need for \nfurther placement assistance.", "6.

Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or \ntest through this grant.\n(300 words):\nMeasurement is an integral part of all Pratham programs. Be it internal \nmeasurement, or external evaluations such as by government assessment \nagencies and industry sector bodies, Pratham has established a strong culture \nof capturing and using data rigorously to demonstrate impact over the past \nseveral years.\nIn 2013, Pratham set up a separate Measurement, Monitoring and Evaluation \n(MME) Unit to be able to systematically carry out a set of planned evaluations \nto measure and track progress and impact.  This evidence is now internally \nanalyzed to understand the strengths and shortcomings of Pratham\u2019s \nprograms, and to assist in developing solutions to improve the effectiveness of \nthe programs.\nA key measure of our impact is the number of youth trained that retain jobs \nbeyond 6 months \u2013 this is a measure we have adopted above and beyond the \nstandard metrics of training and placement that are the norms for the sector. \nWe are also trying to use the insights from our measurement of impact to get \na similar measurement adopted by the entire ecosystem.\nCurrently, Pratham gathers both quantitative and qualitative information \nabout all students enrolled at the training center. At each of the centers, \nOak Application Form     15\nconcerned staff will gather extensive background details such as family \nincome, educational qualifications and fee status of each student which will \nthen be compiled in the \u2018Salesforce\u2019 Management Information System \n(MIS). The reports generated will include both Quantitative Metrics (such as \nthe number of students enrolled, trained, certified, and supported as \nentrepreneurs, as well as retention and dropout rates) and Qualitative Data \nabout the social and economic impact of our programs (e.g. through student \ncase studies). Entrepreneurs are also tracked on a monthly basis once \nsupported, for the period of a year, to better understand their progress and \nany challenges faced. The Central Team provides them with ongoing support \nand mentorship during this period.\nData Checks through Internal Dashboard: Pratham uses Salesforce to \ncapture all center & student level data. Pratham has developed centralized \nmonitoring and reviewing through an advanced dashboard (on Salesforce) to \nmonitor progress of the centers. This helps us to monitor the data at the micro \nlevel and take actions as required. Pratham has developed an independent \naudit team responsible for planned and impromptu audits at the center level. \nThey are responsible for overall quality check with a comprehensive \nchecklist and feedback mechanism. Supporters are also encouraged to visit \nthe Centers they sponsor and assess the impact their investment is having \nthrough this transformative educational and vocational training program.\nDaily monitoring process at centers: Regularized monitoring - The \nrationale is to get an understanding about the daily processes and activities \noccurring at the center. Through this we aim to collect data that represents \nstaff attendance, center photographs, student\u2019s mobilization, expense details, \netc.\nAll programs will be tracked throughout the year and an annual report will be \nsubmitted at the end of every year. Pratham will also share reports along with \ncase studies, videos and photographs. We are now planning to use apps to get \ninformation from centers, feedback from students, etc on a regular basis to \nensure better quality and checks. The center heads are required to fill the data \nlike no. of student\u2019s present, no. of staff present with an option to upload live \npictures on a daily basis.\n \nGiven that this will be our first project in the far north-east part of the country, \nwe will leverage this opportunity to learn in-depth about youth from this \nregion. We would like to learn about the aspirations of these youth and explore \nthe need for starting new vocational training programs/ entrepreneurship \nmodels suited specifically for this region. Periodic surveys and focused group \ndiscussions will be conducted to understand the target group of youth in \ngreater depth.", "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.

The teams are committed to complete \nthe project on time as per the schedule of activities mentioned in the MoU.\n2.Operational Risks: Pratham could face challenges in terms of \nmobilization due to lack of willingness of rural youth to join employment \nor their families to allow them to seek employment. Challenges could \narise from resistance of employers to provide employment or food & \naccommodation to trainees under an on-site model. Trainees could also \ndropout from course mid training or not opt for job post training due to \npersonal or family problems.\nMitigation steps:  \nMobilization: Pratham will work towards creating awareness about the \nprogram through digital content to educate the community and youth about \nthe intricacies and realities of the program in order to augment mobilization \nefforts.\nEmployer Support: Pratham will consistently engage with placement \npartners by inviting them for interviews, and guest lectures at the residential \ntraining centres or through virtual sessions to convince them on Pratham\u2019s \npedagogy of teaching and training model. This will enable the placement \npartners to understand the quality of training provided and the skills of the \ntrainees, thereby getting their buy-in to come on board for the onsite model.\nDrop-Out: With an on-site model, there is daily interaction through virtual \nclasses with the Pratham team, in-person interaction during counseling \nsessions conducted weekly/fortnightly. Trainees are also personally attended \nto in case of any issues or difficulties they come across during the training.", "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11.  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS\nPlease use this space to respond to any specific questions from your Oak \nprogramme officer. If none were received, please leave this section blank. \nOak Application Form     17\na. What are the systemic level changes that may be achieved in the \nlong run? The programme needs to evolve from a service delivery \nmode to a more systemic change mode that will position the \nprogramme as a replicable and scalable model for adoption in the \nskilling landscape in India.\nOn a national level, India has taken a Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) \napproach to fulfill the skill development mission in partnership with \nindustry sectors. The PPP model offers the public sector potential cost, \nquality and scale advantages in achieving service targets.\nSince inception in 2015, Pratham\u2019s delivery model of community \nmobilization, residential training at the center with industry vetted \ncurriculum and job placement as an end outcome has scaled from 1 to 130 \ncenters across 15 states in India. Since the pandemic, Pratham has \npivoted to a hybrid skilling model integrating familiar technology and \ntracking systems to provide skill training and help youth sustain in \nemployment.\nThe reach and scale has become 3xmore than what was possible through \ndoor-to-door physical mobilization. In tandem with the national approach \nexcluding public entity involvement at the delivery stage, Pratham \nleverages its strong community engagement initiatives making the model \nsustainable in the long-run.The hybrid skilling model can be easily \nreplicated through capacity building of teams on digital tools & data-\ndriven approaches.\nCan you please try to elaborate on the benefits for the community \nand how the programme can be positioned in the donor landscape \nfor generating more funding traction?\nThe skilling program of Pratham is currently aligned with Goal 8 of SDGs. \nThe Skilling program not only imparts vocational skills to the youth but \nalso has multifold impact on the entire community. To begin with the \ndirect beneficiary, the youth themselves receive an holistic education \nwhen ongoing training (including life skills, financial literacy, and many \nmore). This prepares them for the outside world learning to manage \nthemselves away from the family. As our model demands them to stay out \nof home for a certain period of time this allows them to become more \nconfident about themselves.\nNecessary awareness of other available employment opportunities will \nhelp provide direction with regard to proper skilling of the youth in \nreference to their profession of choice. Financial literacy skills (inculcated \nwithin the skilling programs) will help foster fiscally sound decisions with \nregard to their money. Moreover, financial literacy has a significant \nimpact on families as this knowledge helps balance family budgets, \nensuring proper utilization of funds for household necessities, health \ninsurance, children\u2019s education, retirement etc.\nSeeing this, the community is encouraged to send more youth to such \nprograms.\nPratham evolved its approach of training when the pandemic hit. From a \nresidential model Pratham moved to a hybrid model using the center, \ncommunity spaces and placement partner properties as a space for \npractical training. This enabled Pratham to enter communities and \nOak Application Form     18\ninteract with the people directly. This shift in strategy allowed Pratham to \nreach out to more villages and increase its presence.\nAs most of the funding is received from CSRs and Foundations with an \nobjective to promote livelihood and sustainable economic growth, the \nPratham skilling model ensures visible indicators of impact, focussing on \nemployability status, income generation and industry absorption. As most \nof Pratham\u2019s work focuses on skilling of youth these programs allow \ninteraction with organizations in a capacity of volunteering and employee \nengagement. Direct interaction through motivational speeches, life skills, \nwork ethics, etiquette, interview preparations are possible in this model.\n \nb. There is a scope to align the cross-sectoral impact of this \nprogramme on reducing instances of unsafe/distress migration and \ntrafficking, education attainment and collectivization of youth. \nThese may therefore be further elaborated with clear objectives \nwhich can uniquely position the programme as a skilling \nprogramme with multi-dimensional impact. \u2013 You can try to include \nthis as one of the project objectives and state the collaboration that \ncan be attained with the other Oak grantees working in the North \nBengal tea garden space.\n \nPratham\u2019s model of skilling not only imparts vocational skills to the youth \nbut also has multifold impact on the entire community.\n1.Alternative income source: Additional income inflow into families \nthrough youth taking up formal jobs will help improve the overall \nstandard of living of these communities, aiding in better healthcare \nfacilities  and schooling opportunities for children.\n2.Counseling support: Physical presence of a training center will serve \nas a hub for all kinds of information support for skilling and \nemployment opportunities. The team will  be instrumental in \ncounseling youth and young children towards available career \npathways and help mitigate trafficking activities in the vicinity.\n3.Boost to local economy: Youth who wish to opt for self-employment \nwill be guided to start their own enterprises.\n4.Financial Literacy: Imparted to youth during the skilling programs \nwill help foster fiscally sound decisions with regard to their money. \nSuch knowledge will help balance family budgets, ensuring proper \nutilization of funds for household necessities, health insurance, \nchildren\u2019s education, retirement etc.\n5.Building youth community volunteers: A unique \u2018Education for \nEducation\u2019 model will be linked to the vocational training program for \nthe youth. The intent is to make the youth a key stakeholder in the \nlearning curve of children of the community. In exchange for the \nvocational training modules, youth will be trained to deliver short \ninterventions for the children of the community to build and enhance \ntheir basic foundational skills of reading and arithmetic.\n \nOak Application Form     19\n     c. Since the vocational training programme will be launched in a \nnew geography, it will be good to document the evolution (programme \nlaunch, challenges, opportunities and risks and success) of past \ntraining programmes in similar geographies characterized by skills \ngaps, location remoteness and technological limitations. Have such \nprogrammes yielded positive results? If so, what have been the \ncontributing factors? \u2013 Can you therefore state the experience of \nPratham in launching such programmes in new geography and the \noverall experience and the successes/challenges?\n \nEvery geography represents a unique culture and has its own \nadvantages and constraints. Pratham has always adopted an inclusive \napproach, tailoring the model based on the needs of a specific region. \nPratham\u2019s vocational training initiatives in Gadchiroli, a tribal region in \nMaharashtra started in 2012 in collaboration with the forest and police \ndepartments. An inclusive counseling approach and facilitation of \ntransportation for tribal youth to training centers in Maharashtra \nhelped increase receptiveness among the tribal population. 5000+ \nyouth have been trained so far from Gadchiroli in hospitality, \nconstruction and automotive trades who went on to pursue formal \nentry-level jobs post training. This approach was also recognized \nthrough the PM\u2019s award for public administration awarded to District \nAdministration for the innovative partnership with Civil Society.\nSome factors that are unique to Pratham\u2019s model and have been \nsuccessful  across different states in India have been illustrated below:\n \n1.Strong Community Engagement: Pratham\u2019s mentors ( community \nmobilizers) engage extensively with all community stakeholders- \nsarpanch, self-help groups, community leaders and households on a \nregular basis. Community meetings, fairs, rallies, learning activities \nwith children are some of the mediums through which members of the \ncommunity are engaged and informed about Pratham\u2019s education and \nskilling interventions. Together with the education programs, \nPratham\u2019s presence is spread across 20,000 communities in 17 states \nacross the country. Pratham has built strong volunteer networks within \nthese communities who form an integral part of the intervention and \nhelp sustain the initiatives in the long-run.\n2.Detailed Need Assessment Survey: Pratham conducts needs \nassessment surveys within the community and with industry partners of \nthe region before initiating a new program. The survey helps \nunderstand the demographic profile and  aspirations of youth in \ngreater depth along with industry demand for different job roles in the \nregion. This helps in designing the program and adopt an inclusive \napproach considering region specific challenges. The team also visits \nand interacts with local stakeholders and organizations working in the \nregion to understand the local context in more depth.\n3.Counseling : Pratham\u2019s experience over the past decade has re-\naffirmed the importance of counseling time and again- not only of the \nskilling aspirant but of his/her family and the community in general in \nOak Application Form     20\nthe entire skilling value chain. The process of counseling is therefore \ndeeply embedded at every step of the skill training, placement and \nalumni engagement levels. There are different stakeholders involved at \neach level and the nature and approach is customized to suit the need \nof the time. Overall, 10 hours\u2019 worth of counseling is done beginning \nfrom mobilization, training and placement. Alumni engagement \ninvolves periodic contact with the graduates with the frequency varying \nbased on the need of the hour in addition to the structured group \nevents held at each location.\n4.Practical Hands-on Training: 15 days of the Level 3 course module \nis based on practical training which offers a unique opportunity for \nyouth to learn real-life application of trade specific skills. This helps \ntrainees get a first-hand experience of a work-place scenario helping \nthem transition smoothly into formal work environments as soon as \nthey graduate.\n5.Content Innovation: Pratham has digitized all its training content and \nreading material and uploaded the entire package on Pratham Open \nSchool Platform for ease of accessibility by trainees. Youth can visit the \nsite and refer to the content at all times. Further, Pratham\u2019s trainers \nthemselves have created interesting videos taking inspiration from \nreal-life situations which are uploaded on the open school site and \nshared with trainees as well. These help to create more relatable \nexperience for youth helping them grasp technical knowledge faster.\n6.Data-driven systems: Every program is designed based on evidence \nfrom data and decision-making at every step is highly data-driven.\nChallenges:\nThe project may entail the following risks.\n1.Timeline: Project may not be implemented as per timeline/schedule \nmentioned in the MoU due to operational challenges, unexpected \nholidays, local festivals, Government elections, environmental stresses.\nMitigation steps:\nPratham will deploy monitoring checks at the center, state and central \nlevel at regular intervals to ensure that the proposed implementation \ntimeline is adhered to. The teams are committed to complete the project on \ntime as per the schedule of activities mentioned in the MoU.\n2.Operational Risks: Pratham could face challenges in terms of \nmobilization due to lack of willingness of rural youth to join \nemployment or their families to allow them to seek employment. \nChallenges could arise from resistance of employers to provide \nemployment or food & accommodation to trainees under an on-site \nmodel. Trainees could also dropout from course mid training or not opt \nfor job post training due to personal or family problems.\nMitigation steps:  \nMobilization: Pratham will work towards creating awareness about the \nprogram through digital content to educate the community and youth \nabout the intricacies and realities of the program in order to augment \nmobilization efforts.\nOak Application Form     21\nEmployer Support: Pratham will consistently engage with placement \npartners by inviting them for interviews, and guest lectures at the \nresidential training centers or through virtual sessions to convince them on \nPratham\u2019s pedagogy of teaching and training model. This will enable the \nplacement partners to understand the quality of training provided and the \nskills of the trainees, thereby getting their buy-in to come on board for the \nonsite model.\nDrop-Out: With an on-site model, there is daily interaction through virtual \nclasses with the Pratham team, in-person interaction during counseling \nsessions conducted weekly/fortnightly. Trainees are also personally \nattended to in case of any issues or difficulties they come across during the \ntraining.\n \n \nd. The possibility of increasing the co-funding during the course of \nthe programme. Since there is an increasing amount of funding that \nis being directed to skilling programmes in India, there should be a \nclear goal in generating more interest among other donors for \nfunding the skilling programme for youth of the tea gardens. \u2013 Can \nyou state (the source may not be mentioned immediately, if not \ndecided) on how Pratham intends to leverage co-funding for this \nprogramme and also state any avenues which may be explored \njointly by Oak and Pratham to generate funding availability for the \nskilling programmes?\n \nPratham is expanding presence in the Eastern part of India. Pratham actively \napproaches existing and new CSRs and Foundations for expansion in newer \nregions. With the support of Oak, Pratham skilling will be able to show \npresence in the tea garden belt attracting the current and the new CSRs to \nsupport programs in this specific belt.\nUsually when ventured into a new geography, Pratham announces its \nexpansion to donors via emails, newsletters, referrals, social media posts, \nfurther application for proposals, etc. This usually generates interest in \ndonors fleshing out to a partnership.\nPratham also plans to leverage on the existing networks of Oak with other \nnon-profits or funding organizations to expand the scope of funding. This will \nallow Pratham to expand its network and create financial or knowledge \nbased partnerships as required.\n \n \n \n \n \nOak Application Form     22", "12. DECLARATIONS": "12.

Context (The context section should not exceed two pages.)\n6a. Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, \ngovernance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nNazdeek is a women-led legal empowerment organization founded in 2012 by \nJayshree Satpute, Sukti Dhital, and Francesca Feruglio. Throughout their \nprevious litigation and field-work, they realised that marginalised communities \nwere being denied knowledge and access to crucial administrative and non-\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20135\njudicial grievance redressal mechanisms. Therefore, Nazdeek was founded to \nensure community agency and access to justice.\nNazdeek\u2019s current Board: \n\u2022Sukti Dhital (President and Treasurer) \n\u2022Pragya Nair, Taryn Eckstein, Jameen Kaur, and Trusha Mehta (Directors) \nBoard members are offered a two-year position with the possibility of extension. \nSince our founding we have cycled off two former board members. These positions \nwere filled by our current board members. In September 2021, we plan to invite \nCo-founder and Advisor, Francesca Feruglio, to join as a Director.\nBoard members provide critical guidance and strategic support. They connect \nNazdeek to potential funding opportunities, strategic partners, and review \nfinancial and strategic plans. Certain members have additional responsibilities, \ne.g. the Treasurer reviews balance sheets, 990 tax filings and signs relevant \nagreements, and the President liaisons closely with Nazdeek\u2019s team, organizes \nboard meetings and reviews other documents.\nJayshree guides Nazdeek\u2019s overall strategic planning and management. \nTeam Nazdeek: \n\u2022Director \n\u2022Senior Program Officer \n\u2022Senior Litigation Officer \n\u2022Program Officer \n\u2022Two Program Associates \n\u2022Three Community Mobilisers \n\u2022Office Assistant \nAdditionally, there are other support staff including accountants, consultants, and \ninterns. Our network of 55 community paralegals and grassroots organization \npartners  informs our project strategies, and leads community-level organizing and \nadvocacy efforts. When strategically required, Nazdeek utilizes the support of pro \nbono lawyers. We are divided into three project teams: Delhi, Assam and Tamil \nNadu.\nNazdeek\u2019s management and decision-making process is participatory. Team \nleaders, teams, and paralegal volunteers collaborate on strategies and \ninterventions. Nazdeek encourages its team\u2019s wellness and professional \ndevelopment by providing relevant opportunities.\n \n \n \n \n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\n6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\nOperating costs and funds: \nNazdeek started in 2012 through crowdfunding. Since 2014, we successfully \nsecured long-term funding, and periodic short-term grants. Nazdeek\u2019s \norganisational budget for 2020-2021 is $250,000, including grants from various \nfunders since: \n\u2022Amplify Change, in partnership with Swadhikar- May 1, 2016\n\u2022Every Mother Counts (core funding)- May 15, 2014 \n\u2022Laudes Foundation- January 1, 2021 \n\u2022Namati- November 15, 2020 \n\u2022The Fund for Global Human Rights (core and project funding)- May 29, \n2014 \nThese funders have made long-term commitments to legal empowerment work, \nand have aided in strengthening Nazdeek. We also receive \napproximately  $15,000-20,000 annually through individual donations towards \nprograms. \nFundraising strategy:\nOur fundraising needs are identified based on Nazdeek\u2019s organisational vision \nand mission, and an annual strategic assessment of organisational priorities, \ncombined with community, partner organization, and paralegal needs. While no \none staff member is dedicated to fundraising, all co-founders, board members, \nand staff members play a key role in fundraising, including identifying potential \ndonors and writing and pitching proposals.\nWe are occasionally forwarded opportunities by our existing funders. We \napproach individual donors through fundraising campaigns to account for \ncontingencies. \nReserve Funds and Debts: \nNazdeek\u2019s current reserve is approximately $75,000 and there are no outstanding \ndebts. \nExpected Changes: \nThe Oak Foundation Grant will enhance our organisational budget significantly, \nenabling us to realise our vision of introducing our model to other Indian states; \nundertaking national-level policy advocacy; elevating FRTW from an Indian to \nan international coalition; and expanding our team. These goals align with the \nobjectives and strategies in our grant proposal. Nazdeek\u2019s organisation budget \nis expected to reach $715,000 by the end of 2024 due to expanded support from \none of our current funders and being in an advanced stage of a long-term \nfunding application process.\nNOTE: The proposed project will be undertaken in partnership with host \norganisation/s.\n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nNazdeek has successfully worked towards bringing access to justice closer to \nmarginalised communities across South Asia. Since 2012, working closely with \nAdivasi worker communities, we have conducted numerous trainings to expand \nworkers\u2019 knowledge of socio-economic, labour, and maternal health rights. \n\u2022Our training aided activists in their fight for a higher minimum wage for tea \nplantation workers, securing a historic 77% increase in daily wages for \n800,000 tea plantation workers in Assam. Following our efforts providing \ntraining, conducting community meetings, and advocating for workers, the \nAssam government\u2019s Minimum Wage Advisory Committee recommended \nanother wage increase of 110% (from Rs. 167 to Rs. 351) in 2018.\n\u2022Evidence from our human rights fact-finding investigations and monitoring, \nsuch as EndMMNow, supported successful filing of complaints by workers \nto secure their rightful food, health, housing, and labour benefits. \n\u2022Nazdeek also amplified community voices nationally and globally through \npublished reports: \u201cNo Time to Lose: Fighting Maternal and Infant Mortality \nthrough Community Reporting\u201d (2015), \u201cA Matter of Life and Death: \nSurviving Childbirth on Assam\u2019s Tea Plantations\u201d (2018), \u201cHidden Traumas: \nUncovering Experiences of Obstetric Violence\u201d (2020), and \u201cRising \nStronger: Security Strategies for Women Defenders\u201d (2020). \n\u2022Our research in Assam and greater South Asia was also critical in our \nfounding of the FRTW in 2019, a first of its kind forum for advancing the \nrights of tea plantation workers. \n\u2022In Delhi, working with 6 socio-economically marginalised communities, \nNazdeek\u2019s 35 presently-active paralegal volunteers have ensured basic \nentitlements such as community clinics and Anganwadi Centers, and \nhousing, water and sanitation rights for over 15,000 residents. \n\u2022Since 2020, Nazdeek and partners have provided COVID-19 humanitarian \nrelief to over 25,000 individuals in Assam, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu. \n\u2022Nazdeek\u2019s work was recognised with the Namati Grassroots Justice Prize in \n2015 and World Justice Prize in 2019.\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nNazdeek\u2019s legal empowerment model places the communities we work with at \nthe center of our work. We aspire to build leadership among women for greater \nparticipation in decision-making at the community, state, and policy-making \nlevels. Nazdeek\u2019s sustainability strategy creates an advocacy and outreach model \nowned by the community, which thrives without our presence. \nStrategy:\n1. Identifying communities after detailed scoping, assessment, and needs-\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\nmapping. Through community meetings and partnerships with \nlocal organizations, we explain our model and invite participants for \ntrainings. We prioritize outreach in communities marginalised on the basis \nof social identities like caste, class, religion, migration, and work status. \n2. Training participants, predominantly women, to be community paralegals \nand equipping them with administrative and judicial tools for addressing \nrights violations. Using participatory methods, we ensure inclusive and \nsafe training spaces for participants. \n3. Assisting paralegals in using grievance redressal, policy advocacy, and \nstrategic litigation tools. \n4. At every stage, paralegals and communities decide their priorities and \ninitiatives. We assess risks and identify mitigation strategies collectively, \nprioritising their safety and security. \n5. Eventually, paralegals undertake community meetings independently, \nstrengthening their human rights documentation and advocacy skills. \nNazdeek then moves to an advisory role. \n6. To support the long-term work of paralegals and connect community action \nto regional initiatives, we facilitate formation of coalitions. \n7. Paralegals work on a voluntary basis and are not paid an honorarium. This \naligns with Nazdeek\u2019s objective of building community leadership, \nagency,  and ownership of initiatives. Nazdeek does provide them \ncertificates and supports them by sharing opportunities, relevant \ngovernment schemes, and needs-based communications reimbursements.\nSince early 2020, due to the pandemic, we have employed several tools to \ncontinue engagement remotely. While we prioritise in-person visits, we have \nnow developed novel modes of outreach and maintained our strategy despite \nthe crisis.\n \n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nTea plantation workers across South Asia experience dismal living and working \nconditions, earn meagre wages, and face ineffectual labour law protections. In \nIndia, where tea plantation workers are predominantly Adivasi (indigenous) and \nwomen, these conditions have led to an intergenerational cycle of oppression and \npoverty. \nKey issues faced: \n\u2022Currently, corporations function in the roles previously held by colonial \npowers, and are primarily responsible for the poor housing, wages, health \ncare, food, water, and sanitation experienced by tea plantation workers. \n\u2022Workers are not paid a legal minimum wage, sufficient to ensure basic \nnecessities for themselves and their families. \n\u2022Women do not receive sufficient medical care, especially pre- and post-natal \nmaternal healthcare, leading to extremely high rates of anaemia, and high \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139\nmaternal and infant mortality on tea plantations.\nNazdeek, with its partner organizations, has aided workers in addressing these \nproblems and issues. However, recent circumstances have worsened this \nsituation. \nChallenges: \n\u2022Due to the current political situation in India, organisations and individuals \ndoing cutting edge rights work face a higher risk of coercive actions. \nPlantations have become inaccessible due to greater surveillance by their \nmanagement. \n\u2022While the pandemic has opened up new ways of communicating for the rest \nof the world, our project communities have very limited access to electricity, \ngadgets, and the internet. \n\u2022The Central government has repealed and replaced 29 previous national \nlabour laws with just 4 labour codes. While the previous laws did not \nprovide robust worker protections, certain laws such as the Plantations \nLabour Act, did ensure specific protections for workers on tea plantations. \n\u2022Employers have taken advantage of the current legal ambiguities, wherein \nold laws have been repealed, but the new laws are not yet in force, further \nlimiting the rights of workers on tea plantations. \n\u2022Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an even more dire \nsituation for tea workers, as the pandemic-induced lockdown has created \nfood scarcity as government-run ration shops and health centers remain \nclosed or under-operational. Conversely, tea workers continue to be forced \nto work despite the pandemic and minimal safeguards on plantations. \nOpportunities: \nAddressing both the long-standing issues experienced by tea plantation workers \nand the new issues created by the pandemic is a struggle in the current legal and \npolicy climate. However, this also makes it an increasingly important time to \nmobilize workers and assist them in their advocacy, as workers have the \nopportunity to comment on proposed laws and shape local policy in an effort to \nstrengthen their legal rights. \n\u2022To overcome communication challenges, Nazdeek, its paralegals, and \ncommunities are adopting innovative methods. For example, we recently \nconducted 12 intensive online training sessions on labour laws with tea \nworkers in Assam. \n\u2022With Central and State governments currently drafting rules to the labour \nlaws, an opportunity has arisen for tea workers to engage in this process \nand to effect policy and legislative change. Nazdeek has therefore been \nfacilitating their participation through trainings, consultations, and FRTW, \nresulting in submission of 5 comments to draft rules. This has allowed wider \nstakeholder representation, and workers have gained confidence to engage \nin similar processes in the future. \n\u2022Due to the aforementioned threats, now is a critical time for tea plantation \nworkers\u2019 advocacy. Enhancing their advocacy skills will not only address the \nimmediate needs, but will also shape the future of tea workers\u2019 rights. \nLegislative and policy changes now will combat negative effects of India\u2019s \nnew labour laws, as workers will have stronger legal protections and better \navenues for demanding adequate wages, maternal health benefits, and \nimproved living and working conditions.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201310", "7.

Future Plans\nHow will the grant influence the organisation and future plans? (maximum \n300 words):\nFor over a decade, Nazdeek has been a key partner to workers\u2019 collectives and \nCSOs in the rights movements of tea plantation workers in India. The four new \nlabour codes, and related rules and policies, will have long-lasting effects on the \nrights of tea plantation workers. Nazdeek intends to continue working with \norganizations in Assam and replicate its legal empowerment model in West \nBengal, and across India through FRTW. This grant opportunity will enable \nNazdeek and our partners to affect the drafting and implementation of these new \nlaws across states. This will have a positive impact on workers\u2019 rights in the \nfuture. This grant will ensure that the communities Nazdeek works with will be in \nthe best position to defend their rights, as they will have developed the skill sets \nnecessary to advocate for themselves and will have strong legal protections on \nwhich to rely. Aside from Nazdeek\u2019s significant advocacy work in India, we have \nalso conducted scoping assessments of the rights of tea plantation workers in \nBangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Nazdeek is dedicated to supporting tea \nplantation workers in their advocacy, and it is critical that workers are organized \nat the national, regional, and international levels to ensure that the industry does \nnot move from one state or country with stronger labour policies to another state \nor country with weaker ones.

ICLEI \nSouth Asia - the South Asian arm of ICLEI - is a not for profit organization, \nwith the head office, located in Delhi, operational in India since 2005. There \nis a regional office in Hyderabad, state offices in Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore) \nand Gujarat (Ahmedabad), and several smaller project offices in different \ncities. We also have staff based in Bangladesh and Nepal. \nThree major achievements of ICLEI South Asia are:\n1.    Over 18 years, office staff strength has increased from 3 to 75, its \nOak Application Form     6\nturnover increasing steadily over the years from about INR 7 crores in 2010 \nto more than three times the value currently, and it has established itself as \na reliable technical support partner for several donor agencies such as GIZ, \nSDC, IDRC, ADB and others, with multiple projects implemented with their \nsupport over time.

Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nThere is intense research on the pressing challenge of access to water and \nsanitation for tea estate workers and their families in Darjeeling and \nKurseong. The situation is also aggravated due to climate change. Climate \nimpacts of decreased rainfall and increased temperatures in the northern \npart of West Bengal are well recorded in the Indian Network for Climate \nChange Assessment (INCCA), 2010 and the West Bengal State Action Plan on \nClimate Change (SAPCC), 2017. Both reports suggest a decrease in overall \nrainy days and an increase of minimum and maximum temperatures for the \nregion. Such changes are not conducive for tea cultivation, and has resulted \nin increased dependency on local water reserves, natural streams and \nreservoirs. A Central Ground Water Board report from 2014 and a study by \nRai et al., 2016 suggest natural springs and their watersheds are inefficiently \nmanaged and facing degradation. Excessive extraction, coupled with limited \nrecharge or rejuvenation of natural reserves is leading to scarcity of water. \nThe scarce resource is also subject to degradation through extensive use of \nOak Application Form     7\nfertilizer, pesticides, and agrochemicals by the tea gardens and \nindiscriminate disposal of waste along the mountain slopes and often into the \nstreams. Since some sources of water are available seasonally, there is \ngreater likelihood of them being degraded during the dry spells. Apart from \nquality and quantity, reliable access to water is challenging as well, with tea \nestates, hotels promoting tea tourism, the managerial staff of tea estates, tea \nestate workers and local indigenous communities outside the tea estates all \ncompeting for the same scarce resource.  Even though it is evident that the \ntea estates play a pivotal role as major stakeholders in the water resources \nof the region, there appears to be a noticeable lack of engagement between \nthe tea estates and the ongoing initiatives of the government. This \ndiscrepancy underscores the critical importance of collaboration among \ndifferent stakeholders. \nThere are a number of schemes of the West Bengal government that are \nlooking at access to water, such as the Jal Dharo, Jal Bharo scheme, the \nJaltirtho schemes that are supporting micro-irrigation technologies, as well \nas water harvesting or storage structures. Some development schemes such \nas the Kanyashree, Lakshmi Bhandar or Chai Sundari schemes look at \nhousing, education or general social development. The current budget has \nallocated INR 823 crores for North Bengal development and more than INR \n1500 crores for water resources development for the fiscal year 2023-24. In \naddition, more than INR 1300 crores have been allocated to technical \ntraining and skill development.\nMore often than not, access to water is subject to an unwritten hierarchy \nwherein the indigenous community and the tea estate workers are at the \nbottom rung. Time and labour-intensive practice of fetching water from \nfaraway places, impacts women in particular from these communities. There \nare reports indicating that consumption of poor quality water or inadequate \nwater has impacted overall health and adaptive capacity of the workers and \nmarginalised local communities. \nICLEI\u2019s experience in the region also reflects these findings. Previous work \nin the region, including in Kurseong, has shown that local communities are \nrarely involved in the critical aspect of water resource management by local \ngovernments. This results in lack of ownership of water related projects and \nsubsequent lack of support by local communities. This means that eventually \nprojects may fall into disrepair, if local communities do not use them \nproperly and carefully. More importantly, the linkages of water resource \nconservation and solid waste management needs to be highlighted and dealt \nwith effectively to keep water resources clean and safe. Gender aspects of \nwater use and management is also not considered in the planning and \nimplementation of water projects.  \nThis project intends to tackle the water crisis faced by the local communities \nby using traditional knowledge and community led practices for rainwater \nharvesting, spring revival, reuse and upcycling of wastewater through \ncoordinated and collaborative efforts of the communities, the local \ngovernments and the private sector involving the tea estates and hotels. The \nproject envisages the crucial involvement of local communities, particularly \nwomen, right from the development of action plans, their implementation \nand monitoring as well as replication and scale up. A cadre of barefoot \nhydrogeologists will be trained from among the local communities, focusing \non local women and youth, giving them the necessary wherewithal to \nOak Application Form     8\nprepare basic water conservation plans and manage their resources in \ncollaboration with other stakeholders.", "6.

Objectives\nList here up to 3 main objectives for this grant (one sentence per objective). Think of objectives as goals \nthat can be achieved within the lifetime of the grant.  We encourage you to think of objective(s) that are \nambitious but also achievable.  \nThe project aims to create and institutionalize a replicable model for \ncommunity-led Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), to develop \nand implement Water Security Plans for tea estates that will help to improve \nthe quality, quantity, access and reliability of water for local communities. \nThe specific objectives of the project include: \n- To mobilise and build capacity of local indigenous community and migrant \ntea estate workers as barefoot hydrogeologists, who are able to assess water \nissues as well as design and implement locally-owned interventions that \npromote water conservation and rejuvenation, in collaboration with local \ngovernments and tea estate management. \n- To improve overall water availability and equitable access to water, thereby \nenhancing the adaptive capacity and resilience of local communities.\n- To create an institutional platform consisting of local governments, \ncommunity representatives, and tea estate management, for overall \nmanagement and robust monitoring of the implementation of water security \nplans, and ensure potential scale up and sustainability.\n \n7.b. Expected Outcomes (bullet points):\nWhat do you expect will change because of this grant? What does success look like?

Outcomes \ndescribe significant changes for people, communities, organisations or systems. Some \nOak Application Form     9\nexamples are changes in policies and legislation; changes in knowledge, awareness, \nattitudes, beliefs, behaviours or social norms; changes in capacities, level of influence, \nagency or access to services. Please refer to the guidance for additional examples.\nThe expected outcomes of the project are: \n- community led and managed water security plans institutionalized in at \nleast 4 tea estates, and adopted by the local governments in the region. \n- a cohort of barefoot hydrogeologists including women, formed and \ninstitutionalized in the region who can eventually not only identify local \nwater issues, but also design and implement interventions to address such \nissues and act as local ambassadors for water resource management. At least \nseven to ten  barefoot hydrogeologists in each tea-estate  to be trained and \ncapacitated. It is also envisaged that at least 50 percent of these barefoot \nhydrogeologists will be women.\n- locally responsive water conservation measures implemented \ncollaboratively by local communities, local governments and tea estate \nmanagement.\n- creation of a societal platform for local communities and tea estate \nmanagement to engage and influence the local governments for safe and \nsustainable water resources.\nIt is well acknowledged that enhancing water security positively influences \nvarious socio-economic and environmental aspects. In the project region, \nwomen typically are responsible for collection of water and enhanced water \nsecurity will reduce the workload for women, providing them with more time \nfor education, income-generating activities and community participation. \nTherefore, it is envisaged that the larger impact of the project will \nextend  beyond access to water, and will lead to improved health of women \nin particular but also their families, better access to sanitation, improved \nsolid waste management to clean up water resources, enhanced livelihoods, \nand, in general, lead to resilient communities. \n \n7.c.

Baseline assessment (M2 - M8) - A baseline data assessment of water \nresource related data, hydro-geological mapping, demography, water use, \nwill be conducted to get ground level information through secondary data \ncollectionThe project team will conduct focused group discussions (FGDs) to \nverify the secondary information collected from different resources. \n3. Gap identification and vulnerability assessment (M6 - M15) - Identification \nof local issues and climate vulnerability of the regional water resources as \nwell as vulnerability of the local population will be studied. Through FGDs \nand stakeholder consultations, interventions will be identified to address the \nwater related issues of local communities, with emphasis on traditional \npractices to address issues on water conservation and management in the \nregion.  \n4. Training and capacity building of barefoot hydrogeologists (M10 - M30) - \nSelection of interested community members, including women and youth will \nbe conducted based on the interest of the local communities shown in the \nFGDs or other consultations. They will be trained as barefoot \nhydrogeologists and hand holding support will be provided to help them \ninstitutionalise the process of local water management.\n5.

Is there anything new about how you are \nchoosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you \nusually work? (300 words):\nThe project proposes to develop a collaborative platform to bring together \ndifferent stakeholders from government, private sector, NGOs and local \ncommunities (particularly women from indigenous and migrant communities) \nto develop, implement and monitor locally led and managed water security \nplans. The platform will facilitate interaction between the stakeholders to \nimplement and monitor actions on ground that promote water security that \ncan be scaled up regionally.\nThe information from the gap analysis in the water and sanitation systems \nand climate vulnerability assessment of the indigenous community, migrant \nworkers and existing water resources will be analysed to develop a climate \nresilient and equitable Community Led Water Security Plans (WaSP) through \nthis platform with full involvement of the local communities, particularly the \ncadre of trained barefoot hydrogeologists. ICLEI SA will consult with the \nlocal communities (particularly women), migrant workers, tea estate owners \nand local authorities through workshops and focused group discussions to \ndevelop a list of possible interventions, both infrastructural and non-\ninfrastructural. The plans will be ratified by the local governments through \ntheir councils to ensure government support, both through supportive \npolicies and possible funding programmes.\nThe Water Security Plans will be developed with particular focus on women, \nwho are largely responsible for household level management of water, but \nnot often engaged in the planning or management of the resources. In \naddition, tea estate management, being responsible for all actions within \ntheir estates, will be involved in the process for greater transparency and \nengagement. Local governments, responsible for water supply,will be \nengaged to collaborate and partner with the communities so that all actions \nare legitimate and acceptable to all parties. \nICLEI South Asia regularly works with different stakeholders, governments, \ncommunities and private sector to prepare and implement plans.

The framework will have clearly specified, \nmeasurable, achievable targets such as number of households with improved \naccess to water/sanitation, amount/quality of water harvested, number of \ncommunity engagement events, number of barefoot hydrogeologists \n(especially women) trained, etc. The framework will articulate the ultimate \nimpact of the project on a larger scale such as improved public health, \nincreased environmental sustainability, and overall well-being of \ncommunities. The progress against each indicator will be monitored \ndepending on its objective, either monthly, bi-annually or annually.  \nThe framework will include elements to assess the gender and social \ninclusivity throughout the project cycle. A stakeholder group, composed of \nkey representatives from marginalized and indigenous populations, especially \nwomen, will be formed to act as a voice for the larger population. \nThe  stakeholders group will be involved throughout the planning and \nimplementation of the project. They will provide inputs to the formulation of \nWaSP, identifying potential interventions to enhance access to water as well \nas during the implementation and finally operation and maintenance. Open \ndialogues will be conducted with the targeted population to build trust and \nensure that selected interventions are responsive to the needs and \naspirations of the community.The process will include quantitative and \nqualitative information gathered from the beneficiaries through participatory \nmethods. Such qualitative information from the beneficiaries and \ncommunities can provide valuable insights and contribute to a more \ncomprehensive assessment of the project success.\nIn addition, a methodology will be identified that can be used periodically by \nthe platform of stakeholders to assess the implementation of the water \nsecurity plan and monitor it over time. The barefoot hydrogeologists will also \nbe trained on relevant and high-quality data collection for better monitoring. \nThe project will introduce and institutionalize a feedback loop mechanism \nwhere community feedback will be incorporated into ongoing MEL \nprocesses.

The project team will \nselect tea estates that are open minded and interested to improve the water \nresource situation during the initial assessment. Continuous engagement \nfrom the beginning throughout the project  will build their trust and sensitize \nthem toward the issue. \n2. Non-cooperation by the local communities: Building trust in external \npeople coming in to resolve local issues is not easy. The project team plans to \nextensively engage with the communities, including having local staff around \nfor continuous communication, so that trust can be built over time. \n3. Political changes: Changes in political leadership, lack of political will or \ncompeting priorities can impact the project implementation. Local \ngovernments will be engaged right from the beginning and a nodal official \nwill be identified for continuous communication. ICLEI\u2019s presence in the \nregion and previous connections will also be useful in this matter.\n4. Data and information gaps: Insufficient or unreliable data on water \nresources, usage, and quality can impact informed decision-making and \nplanning. In such a case, state or regional level data will be extrapolated.\n5. Financial constraints: Lack of funding or budgetary constraints can hinder \nthe implementation of necessary infrastructure and interventions for \nimproving water security. ICLEI is already making plans of applying for \nOak Application Form     14\nfunding from other sources and will also explore local government budgets, \nor state government schemes such as Jal Dharo, Jal Bharo or Jalatirtho will \nbe explored for possible funding. It is to be noted that most of the centrally-\nsponsored schemes and programmes are not well-supported and \nimplemented in the state of West Bengal, so stress will be on state schemes.", "11.

(300 words):\nIndo Global Social Service Society (IGSSS) has been a prominent social \nservice and development support organization in India. It was incorporated \nin 1960 and, since its inception, it has supported a variety of social \ndevelopment projects all over the country. Its vision has been to create a \nhumane social order based on truth, equity, freedom, and justice with special \nemphasis on women, children, and the vulnerable sections of society. Right \nfrom its inception IGSSS focuses on social equity and economic justice. And \nwe continue to work with the communities in marginal territories. In the last \n63 years, IGSSS has gone through various transitions. Till recently, we used \nto fund small NGOs but for the last two years, we have become a full-fledged \nimplementing organisation. And right now we are going through on \norganizational development process focusing on State based approach \nenabling state units as independent units.\nIGSSS is guided by an eminent board which meets every quarter to review \nand guide the organization. The Board also sets policy directions and reviews \nthe impact we are making. The staff team is headed by the Executive \nDirector and organizational leadership is provided through the ED and the \nsenior management team that comprises the Organization Program \nSustainability (OPS) Leads, Finance Leads and Thematic Leads. This team \ncollectively shapes ideas for future actions and steering organizational \nefforts. The interventions are anchored at the state level where State \ncoordinators direct and execute state-level actions. IGSSS comprises over \n200 staff now, with over 30% of staff being women and IGSSS promotes \ngender diversity and inclusion of different marginal spectrum groups in \nhiring and promotion.\nFor additional details please visit: http://igsss.org/ \n 5b.

Even though \nyou may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the \nproposed grant. (300 words)\nThe organization in the 1960s evolved as a financial grant-making agency \nwith a mandate to work against hunger and poverty. It initially began its \noperations as Indo-German Social Service Society working with the funds \nreceived through funding partners in Germany. In the 1980s the focus \nshifted to support projects in food production, health care and education, \nvocational training, employment, and rural development. The renowned \nSmile Programme (Student Mobilization Initiative for Learning through \nExposure) was also started as a national program by IGSSS in 1985. By the \n1990s, IGSSS expanded its presence from Delhi to pan India, opening \nOak Application Form     6\nregional offices. It moved from being a funding agency to a supporting \norganization with collaborations with other NGOs. In the post-2000s era, \nIGSSS turned a new leaf and adopted a more rights-based approach, \nunderwent an organizational development process, and changed in name, \nwith a renewed vision and mission and strategic thrust areas identified. The \norganization's name had evolved into the present Indo-Global Social Service \nSociety to reflect the association with global donors. It was in this phase that \nthe homeless program was initiated as a direct implementation. IGSSS in the \n2010s decade evolved as a leading grant-making organization in India \nsupporting smaller grass-roots NGOs across the length and breadth of the \ncountry. Since 2019 onwards, IGSSS has remodelled our work as an \nimplementing agency, with a new HR structure with state offices and digital \nstrengthening for a people-led global and grassroots action for a just society.\nIGSSS has been concerned with urban poverty since the turn of the \nMillennium. Working in over 35 cities, more than 200,000 families have \nbenefitted through 2015 \u2013 2020. IGSSS now has extensive experience in \nurban poverty interventions in India and is widely networked with existing \nCSO actors and movements. In our actions since 2018, we have gradually \ndeveloped our understanding of sustainability in the urban context and since \n2020, through Satat Shehar Programme (2020 \u2013 ongoing), we have through \nclimate vulnerabilities and impact lens started to mainstream climate action \nwith 260 urban poor communities leading the change. We are having \ninternal organizational experience working with rural climate change actions \nfor many decades and that is helping us immensely in the existing work. This \nintervention is spread across 13 cities in mostly north, central, and eastern \nIndian cities with a focus on slums and community development for Unnat \nBastis (developed\u2013model slums). We also have a climate change thematic, \nthat closely works with urban thematic to address urban poor / worker \nclimate change issues in the project actions. IGSSS is also working with \ngovernments across scales to push climate action and resilience building, \nsome efforts in Jharkhand, Kashmir, and Odisha are noteworthy. Aside from \nSatat shehar intervention, in December 2021, IGSSS embarked on initiating \na new project for informal workers under the title of Punarnirman (Build \nback better) (2021-ongoing) for informal workers and their issues of insecure \nlivelihoods, especially in the post \u2013 COVID phase in 160 worker collectives. \nThis intervention is spread across 8 cities in mostly north, central, and \neastern Indian cities.\nClimate resilience building for informal sector workers has been completely \nmissed in the state-led interventions till now. Our engagement with worker \ngroups shares the need for an increased focus on developing an \nunderstanding of climate impacts and building capacities to deal with them \nwill be critical for informal workers in India. We have made sufficient \nprogress on climate actions since 2020 in urban when we brought in climate \naction as part of urban interventions. In urban, we are working with the \nurban poor in behavioural aspects, as well as to secure their settlements. \nAnd are already collaborating with numerous experts and organizations on \nthe same.[1]  IGSSS is also increasingly taking up the role of policy \ndevelopment for climate actions through its participation in COP 26 and \nother national/international platforms to amplify the needs and requirements \nof urban poor constituents. Lately, we have pushed climate action for \ninformal workers in our national networking meeting under the Punarnirman \nproject action and have just initiated small studies to assess the loss and \nOak Application Form     7\ndamage of informal workers; and propose/ frame actions/ policies for \ndifferent workers to deal with climate impacts.\nIGSSS interventions in the last many years have seen dozens of policy \nchanges at the state and national levels and successful model interventions \u2013 \nincluding the successful policy contributions that transformed into guidelines \nthrough NULM-SUH, welfare measures for urban poor - homeless during \nCOVID, PMSVANIDHI, and other numerous policy improvements.  Recently \nIGSSS along with informal worker leaders and federations of hawkers, met \nrepresentatives of ILO and NitiAyog to push the climate impact agenda of \ninformal workers into policy action. In April 2023, IGSSS was also made a \ntask-force member for NULM 2.0 redrafting process. by MoHUA. It is needed \nthat urgently, in this phase of India\u2019s policy development towards climate \nresilience, urban informal workers and their impacts, and loss are \nhighlighted to make the policy framework inclusive.  \n[1] IGSSS through its much older rural work on climate change, and now \nincreasing work on urban climate action is already in collaboration with \norganizations like CANSA, TERI, INECC and so on.\n \n5c.

(600 words):\nContext\nInformal workers form the mainstay of the Indian economy. They constitute a \nsignificant portion of the Indian workforce, estimated to be around 90% of \nthe total workforce.[1] Yet they face a lack of job security, low wages, and \npoor working conditions. They are also not eligible for benefits such as \npension, insurance, and paid leave, which are available to formal sector \nworkers. The live-work conditions of informal workers, especially in cities are \nan ignored reality wherein the formal state-led (exclusionary) urban vision \nhas neglected the settlements that house the informal workers. Whilst there \nare initiatives taken by the state to bring the workers\u2019 rights under a broad \numbrella of reformed legislations to provide social security to informal \nworkers, the coverage is still limited and restricted, and not holistic.[2]\nThe COVID pandemic has ruptured the status quo and lifted the veil on the \nfault lines in our society. The crisis uncovered the sheer lack of security \u2013 \nsocial and economic \u2013 and the mere reach that the state extended on its \nvulnerable people. The pandemic began in the cities in India. The hardest hit \nis the most \u2018invisible\u2019 poor \u2013 informal workers, migrant workers and marginal \ngroups living in slums and other makeshift dwellings, across urban \ngeographies.  As the economy is gradually returning to normalcy, in the post-\npandemic era, numerous initiatives with a climate resilience perspective are \nbeing undertaken at a national level including dovetailing existing \nOak Application Form     8\ndevelopment\u2013infrastructure programs into climate change discourse. \nUnfortunately, very less of this is concerned with urban informal workers' \nlivelihoods and life in the city.\nSituation Analysis: Assessing the situation of workers in the Kolkata \nMetropolitan Area\nThe Kolkata Metropolitan Area is a metropolitan area in the Indian state of \nWest Bengal, centred around the city of Kolkata (also known as Calcutta). It \nis the largest urban agglomeration in the eastern part of India and the third \nlargest in the country, housing over 14.85 million people, as of the 2011 \ncensus. The Kolkata Metropolitan Area is comprised of the city of Kolkata, its \nsuburbs, several neighbouring towns (including 4 municipal corporations, \nand 27 municipalities) and adjoining rural areas. It is the economic, cultural, \nand educational hub of eastern India and hosts several major commercial \nand industrial centres, making it one of the most important economic zones \nin India.[3]\nInformal workers like street vendors, domestic workers, construction \nworkers and waste pickers are expected to be around 20 - 25 lakh (over 2 \nmillion) in a similar situation as other parts of the country, without much \nsocial security and living in the margins of the current developmental \ndiscourse. The KMA also has a large informal sector that employs a \nsignificant number of migrant workers, particularly in construction, domestic \nwork, and small-scale industries. These workers face compounded challenges \nsuch as low wages, long working hours, and poor working conditions. Many \nof them live in makeshift housing and lack access to basic amenities like \nclean water, sanitation, and health care. Migrant workers face social \nchallenges, such as discrimination, isolation, and limited access to education \nand health services. It is estimated that around 50% of the informal workers \n(1 million) are migrants, with an equal percentage from other districts of \nBengal and migrants from other states like Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, and \nAssam. An equal or similar share of outmigration is reported as well.[4]\nThe Kolkata Metropolitan Area is also located precariously. Like many other \ncoastal cities in the world, is facing a range of impacts from climate change \nand is listed in the top eight megacities to be first impacted by climate \nchange. The city is in the deltaic region of eastern India, which makes it \nvulnerable to sea level rise and increased frequency and intensity of extreme \nweather events such as tropical cyclones, heavy rainfall, and heat waves.[5] \nThe changing climate is leading to an increased risk of coastal flooding and \nerosion, as well as water scarcity, particularly during the dry season. The \ncity's infrastructure and public services, including transportation, energy, \nand water systems, are also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, \nwhich can strain these systems and result in economic losses. In addition to \nthe physical impacts, the changing climate also has social and economic \nimpacts on the people of the Kolkata Metropolitan Area. The most impacted \nareas overlapping directly with the informal worker settlements in the region \nare vulnerable to displacement, loss of livelihoods, and increased poverty \nbecause of climate change.\nTo address these challenges, the government in the Kolkata Metropolitan \nArea, led by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation are taking steps to increase \nthe region's resilience to climate change. This includes implementing flood \ncontrol measures, improving disaster preparedness and response, investing \nin climate-resilient infrastructure, and preparing climate action plans for \nOak Application Form     9\ntheir cities.[6][7] The major concern in the slew of positively directed actions \nis that informal workers, their live-work settlements and their livelihoods as \nof now are not a major focus area of the climate resilience actions pushed by \nthe state and authorities. Thereby ignoring the most vulnerable, impacted \ninformal workers from the climate resilience action plans for the region. Also \nstraight-jacketed approaches of focusing on the urban \u2018infrastructure\u2019 \nbuilding, without focusing on capacities and linkages ignoring migration \nfrom climate-impacted rural regions is another gap amongst many in the \nclimate resilience actions. This approach requires a \u2018change\u2019: in perspective \nand in action.  That is what PARIVARTAN intervention sets to achieve \u2013 \nCHANGE that is for and led by the empowerment of the most vulnerable \ninformal worker communities.\nThe situation analysis and approach have been developed in discussion with \nexperts on climate actions and informal workers, existing secondary sources, \nIGSSS urban teams' experience and previous consultations organized by \nIGSSS. The project aims to keep inclusion, equity and diversity of informal \nworkers along with gender concerns at the core of project interventions.\n[1] In India, informal workers are those individuals who work in unorganized \nsectors and are not covered by labour laws or social security measures. This \nsegment of the workforce includes self-employed individuals, casual \nlabourers, street vendors, domestic workers, and other unorganized sector \nworkers.\n[2] The labour codes in India refer to a set of laws and regulations that \ngovern various aspects of employment, including wages, working conditions, \nsocial security, and industrial relations. In 2020, the Indian government \nintroduced four new labour codes, namely, the Code on Wages, the Industrial \nRelations Code, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions \nCode, and the Social Security Code.\n[3] https://kmda.wb.gov.in/\n[4] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/more-migrants-to-city-\nfrom-other-states-than-districts/articleshow/70354414.cms\n[5] https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/disaster-deaths-\nsinking-unprepared-kolkata-face-multiple-climate-risks-warns-ipcc-report-\n82004\n[6] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-set-to-get-own-\nclimate-action-plan-2nd-city-after-mum/articleshow/92049423.cms\n[7] https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/cop27-kolkata-\npresents-climate-action-roadmap-announces-city-level-summit-86026", "6.

Building self-reliant worker collectives through monthly meetings & 8 \ncapacity building training and workshops in 4 years. The focus will be \non climate-resilient livelihood capacity building, education, and skills \ntraining. 12 localized campaigns to access basic services and \nentitlements.\n2. Access to finance and initiating collective income generation actions \nthrough 8 training courses for incubating models.\n3. Special focus on the inclusion of women workers and migrant workers.\nAt the community/ meso level\n4. 8 disaster risk reduction education and preparedness in worker \nsettlements/worksites. And 6 interface meetings will be planned to \npresent preparedness plans to representatives and government \ndepartments.\n5. Select 50 improved and resilient infrastructures in worker \nsettlements/worksites. \nAt the city/state & network / macro level\n6. 8 ULB-level and 4 state-level CSO networking meetings for \nstrengthening social/legal protection systems by workers as well as by \nthe state.\n7. 4 Policy engagement for inclusion of workers.\n8. 3 Collaboration between ULBs, government, private agencies, and civil \nsociety organizations.\n9. Developing rural\u2013urban linkages through 8 campaigns by CSO \nnetworks and worker leaders for migrant workers.\n10. 8 federation buildings of informal sector workers in KMA, West \nBengal & sharing at the National level.\nOak Application Form     13\nThe main set of actions for building resilient worker collectives is the \nfollowing:\nAt the local /micro level\n1.Building self-reliant worker collectives: Informal workers access \ntheir identification, entitlements, and basic services through \ncommunity-managed WRCs (worker resource centres) in the local and \ncollectives formalize as membership-based organizations for self-\nreliance. In year 1, community mobilization will be the focus, in years 2 \n& 3 gradually the focus will shift towards self-reliance and local-level \nresilience, in year 4 there will be a focus shift towards worker \ncollectives\u2019 sustainability and formalization of collectives.\n2.Climate-resilient livelihood capacity building and training: \nProviding training and capacity-building opportunities to informal \nworkers on climate-resilient livelihood practices and techniques can \nhelp them to better adapt to changing conditions. Year 1 actions will be \ndirected at understanding the issues of workers through a climate lens, \nmaking action plans and acting on them. At the outset, there will be \nPLA workshops organized with different workers themselves and \nthrough those exercises, the nuanced nature of impacts will be mapped \nand then the resilience practices will be developed accordingly. The \npractices will differ for each population group as their nature of work \ndiffers dramatically. Years 2 & 3 will lead to more focused capacity \nbuilding on climate resilience. Year 4 will document \u2013 formalize the \nimpacts, success, and challenges of capacity-building actions. To \naddress the gender aspects sub-group worker workshops will be \nhosted to and through facilitation will the gender issues be noted and \nan action plan developed. Years 2 & 3 will lead to more focused \ncapacity building on climate resilience. Year 4 will document \u2013 \nformalize the impacts, success, and challenges of capacity-building \nactions.\n3.Providing education and skills training: Workers, especially, \nwomen and migrant workers can benefit from education and skills \ntraining programs that can help them upgrade their skills/ upscale \nactions and find better-paying jobs. Baseline mapping and needs will \nbe assessed in year 1, and support/ training initiated for skilling. Year \n2 will focus on assessing the impacts and improving the modules. Years \n3 & 4 will scale, document, and share the impacts, successes, and \nchallenges of skilling workers.\n4.Access to finance and initiating collective income generation \nactions: Providing access to finance, including microfinance services, \ncan help informal workers in Kolkata start new businesses or diversify \ntheir income streams, making them more resilient to the impacts of \nclimate change. NULM - SHG funds are expected to be a resource for \nsuch program actions. Or programs like PMSVANIDHI that were \nintroduced by govt. post covid for street vendors. This is especially \ncritical in post-COVID times. Like other capacity-building actions, year \n1 will assess the needs and initiate income generation skilling and \ndesigning project actions, and years 2 & 3 will be about piloting them \nand documenting their impacts. Year 3 will scale, document, and share \nthe impacts, successes, and challenges of income generation modules.\nOak Application Form     14\n5.Special focus on inclusion of women workers and migrant \nworkers: As a practice and strategy, the aim will be to focus on the \nmost vulnerable workers like women workers and migrant workers for \nall actions to ensure their inclusion.\nAt the community/ meso level\n6.Disaster risk reduction education and preparedness in worker \nsettlements/worksites: Informal workers should be educated on \ndisaster risk reduction measures, including evacuation procedures, \nearly warning systems, and proper storage and handling of goods. This \nis to be executed both at informal workers' livelihood sites as well as \ntheir living settlements. Year 1 will be aimed at simplified \nunderstanding and mapping of climate impacts, disaster risks and \nthreats on maps documenting them. Year 2 will be focused on acting \non them and developing preparedness in communities and engaging \nwith authorities for executing them. Years 3 & 4 will repeat the \nprocess and refresh preparedness plans and task force teams from \ncommunities will be ready for any disasters.\n7.Improved and resilient infrastructure in worker \nsettlements/worksites: Improving the infrastructure in informal \nworker communities, such as street vendor markets and in their living \nsettlements - slums, can help to reduce their exposure to extreme \nweather events and improve their overall living/ working conditions. \nStarting from preparedness and evacuation maps in year 1, in year 2 \ncommunity-led planning for improved \u2013 resilient settlements and \nworksites will be initiated and submitted as Local Area Plans (LAPs) to \nthe authorities. In years 3 & 4, the exercise will be undertaken further \nto improve the condition of the settlement to a model settlement that \ncan be upscaled later. With the last year to focus on documentation \nand scaling of resilience-building practices. \nAt the city/state & network / macro level\n8.Strengthening social/legal protection systems by workers as well \nas by the state: The worker collectives to self-help and support their \nmembers. And Governments and a network of civil society \norganizations should work to strengthen social protection systems for \ninformal workers in Kolkata, such as providing access to health \ninsurance, legal assistance, and food assistance during times of crisis. \nIn Year 1,2 along with CSO support worker communities will be \nsupported for social\u2013legal assistance. Year 3 practices and methods \nwill be documented during implementation. Year 4 impacts will be \nassessed, practices improved and actions scaled.  \n9.Policy engagement for inclusion of workers: Policy engagement \nefforts can help to address the systemic issues that contribute to the \nvulnerability of informal workers in Kolkata, including promoting \ndecent working conditions and strengthening labour laws. Policy briefs \nwill be prepared in all the years and submitted to relevant authorities \nfor policy progression.\n10.Collaboration between ULBs, government, private \nagencies, and civil society organizations: Collaboration between \nULBs, government agencies, private agencies and civil society \nOak Application Form     15\norganizations can help to ensure that the needs and concerns of \ninformal workers are addressed in the development and \nimplementation of climate resilience measures. Pilot programs and \ndemonstrations are to be executed through formal collaborations with \nthe government where possible. Year 1 will focus mostly on sharing \npractices and experiences. Year 2 will work on the implementation of \ncollaborative actions and Years 3 & 4 will focus on the formalization of \nactions and collaborations.\n11.Developing rural\u2013urban linkages through CSO networks \nand worker leaders for migrant workers: Building community \nsupport networks: Migrant workers can benefit from community \nsupport networks that provide them with emotional and practical \nsupport. These networks can also help them access resources and \nservices that they might not otherwise be able to access. Year 1 will \nfocus mostly on sharing practices and experiences. Years 2 & 3 on \npiloting engagements and exchanges with networks, and communities. \nYear 4 will document, upscale and formalize the interventions, vis-\u00e0-vis \nmigrants.\n12.Federation building of informal sector workers in KMA, \nWest Bengal & sharing at the National level: The worker \ncollectives, CSOs and networks will work together to mainstream \ninformal workers' concerns in emerging issues of urban development \nand climate resilience building. There will be a workers federation \nemerging in KMA, and through networking at the state level and \nnational levels, the worker's issues will be mainstreamed with climate \nresilience actions. As per the collective\u2019s strength, guidance and \nsupport will be offered from year 1 onwards. With a special focus to \nscale efforts in year 2 and on building formal institutions in years 3 and \n4.\nStrategies for the Interventions\n1.Vision for Sustainable Cities & Resilience Building as the \noverarching framework for Interventions for IGSSS: The changed \ncontext of Indian cities is the key reason for the proposition of an \noverarching framework of sustainable cities that addresses not only \nthe issue of inclusivity but equity along with the issues of \nsustainability, resilience, urban governance and participation in the \ncity making process. The vision for sustainable cities developed in 2020 \nstill holds good and needs to be furthered with the resilience building \nof informal worker communities. IGSSS has since 2020 moved beyond \nsustainability, but also is in the process of developing a holistic \norganizational process for resilience building. The ongoing churning \nalso forms the basis for the interventions proposed in the proposed \nintervention.\n2.Demystifying climate resilience for enabling localized actions: \nTo enable localized actions, it is important to demystify climate \nresilience by breaking it down into more manageable components. It \nwill be expected that IGSSS collaborates and partner with technical \nagencies with \u2018expertise\u2019 in climate action, but the project will strive to \ndevelop community \u2018expertise\u2019 in addressing the resilience needs.  By \ntaking steps to demystify climate resilience for informal workers, \nOak Application Form     16\nlocalized actions can be taken to support these workers in adapting to \nand building resilience against the impacts of climate change. This can \nhelp ensure that the most vulnerable members of society are not left \nbehind in the face of this global challenge.\n3.Planned interventions in all levels and scales \u2013 The proposed \ninterventions are imagined to be at the level of local/ micro level, \ncommunity/ meso level, city, state, and national/ macro level. The \nlocal/micro will focus mostly on informal worker collectives and their \nneeds in the local like capacities, training, access to identity, \nentitlements and so on. At the community level/ meso level, the focus is \nmore on developing resilience at their working and living sites and will \ninvolve engagements with the wider community. At the city, state, and \nnational/macro levels, the focus will be on policy change and network \nbuilding. This differential level intervention has worked well in the \nprevious IGSSS actions and suits well for an informal worker climate \nresilience project, and we hope to improve the same in the coming \ninterventions.\n4.Gradual/strategic development of project actions led by worker \ncollectives starting from micro to macro:  Since the focus of the \nproject is community mobilization leading to resilience building, the \nfocus initially (year 1) will be on building capacities of the collectives, \nstarting with initial low hanging fruits like entitlements and identity \ndocuments, then going on to engage on meso level issues of developing \nthe worker settlements, then with support from CSO network groups \ncould influence and reach out to government and private players\u2019 \naccountability. As we move towards year 2 and year 3, the focus will \nshift from collectivization to collective action on objective2 (community \nlevel) and 3 (city/state federations). Objective 1 actions will be led by \nworker leaders themselves in the long run and are imagined to be \nsustainable in a span of two project cycles.\n5.People (worker) led development in the micro, meso, and IGSSS-\nled action in the macro level: The worker and community collectives \nin the local are expected to take complete ownership of the actions at \nthe local and community level. Training and mobilization of worker \ncollectives will be the prerogative of IGSSS local staff. The state staff \nwill focus on networking// federation at the city/ state level for \ncollaborative actions. The IGSSS Thematic will steer networking at a \nnational level and contribute to the policy discourse on climate change, \ninformal workers and urbanization in India and Global South from a \nresilience lens.\n6.Developing people\u2019s institutions and organizations: The proposed \nprogram envisages that community collectives/ people\u2019s organizations \ndo not just remain as community-based initiatives in the project period \nbut sustain and continue to work as bulwarks of local democracy and \nurban resilience for worker communities. This will be attempted \nthrough a host of capacity building and handholding of the worker \ncollectives. Alongside this, the key strategy will be to work at their \npersonal level on life skills, building resilience and developing a \nmechanism for reporting violations and abuses to key points for \naddress and preservation of dignity in their lives, also by supporting \nOak Application Form     17\nthe community collectives to adopt sustainable and resilience building \ninitiatives in their local and community level.\n7.Building networks and sustaining established ones \u2013 The terrain \nfrom the national level policy engagement has shifted to the state and \nULB levels. It is in this context that the premise of community \nfederations into a larger critical mass is foundational to having larger-\nlevel policy engagement. Community collectives, extremely successful \nlocals, need spaces and opportunities to collaborate and learn from \neach other to raise bigger demands for more inclusive city spaces and \nparticipatory decision-making. This underlying theme forms the other \nfundamental assumption in the project design. Consequently, such \nspaces for forming city-level and state-level federations are provided \nfor in the project intervention that will go a long way in engaging with \nthe state and mainstreaming the informal workers and climate justice \ndiscourse in policy circles. It is also expected that these networks that \ndevelop will be composed of middle-class groups, and private agencies/ \nbodies as well, with a common consensus developed with the informal \nworkers to demand climate resilience and sustainable cities for all.\n8.Policy engagement, as well as collaboration with the different \nlevels of the government \u2013 Engagement and working with the state, \nis put forth as the only way to better the development of communities \nand cities. Especially for informal workers in the context of climate \nresilience building. The reason why the different levels of state and \nbureaucracy fail to function as expected is because of the lack of \nengagement, access and proximity to the urban poor issues, it is this \ngap that the project wishes to address between the communities and \nthe state, through multifarious engagements from the local community \ndevelopment plans to the state - national policy level discussions. The \nstate, especially the ULBs are looking for collaborative opportunities \nwith organizations for climate action and that space needs to be \nutilized. Existing Oak Foundation partners with networks will also aid \nin the process of building collaborations, especially with the private \nsector.\n9.Thematic Hub of Urban Poverty Reduction contributes to \nnational-level policy discourse: The last phase has initiated the \ndevelopment of the Urban Poverty Thematic Hub in IGSSS, it is in now \na steering position to direct the national discourse on sustainable \nurbanization, wrt to informal workers and their inclusion in urban \nresilience \u2013 climate actions. With a good number of partners and \nnetworks, it is expected that a strong national network will emerge to \nkeep a close watch on policy development and aid in developing the \nunderstanding of urban poor and climatic justice discourse with the \nCSOs and wider public nationally, and internationally.\n10.Research and documentation will be integral to the project \nand would strengthen the engagement initiatives. The city and \nstate-level situations/ datasets of the target groups will be consolidated \nat the national level for effective engagement. The information from \ncities and states shall also help in building/contributing to campaigns, \ncollaborations, and policy engagement at the state/national level.\nStaff structure\nOak Application Form     18\nThe staff structure is to suit the implementation reality. There will be more \nfocus on rooting the interventions with the community mobilisers, who will \nbe leading the interventions in the communities mostly under micro-level \nactions. The community mobilisers will be supported by a community \ncoordinator who capacitates communities for meso actions and supports \nnetworking at the city/state level. The capacity building and training \nofficer will be entrusted with training communities, and leaders through \nIGSSS city & local staff and developing and executing the training modules. \nThe project coordinator will be the executing in charge of the project.

Half-yearly review \nmeeting with teams is also conducted regionally for result tracking and cross-\nlearning.\nManagement Information System (MIS)\nThe project level MIS begins with - 1. Analysis and benchmarking of a baseline \nstudy of any project before its inception at the project level. Thereafter 2. \nrefinement of the project indicators based on RBM and IGSSS strategic plans \nmay be carried out. In discussions with funding partners and organizations. 3. \nSetting up performance tracking tables at the project level with targets and \nbaseline figures to be finalized. 4. Setting project-level tools for recording \nresults. We use e-tools like the Kobo collects app to collect and record data at \nthe field level. Then, 5. periodic data collection and compilation are executed. \nUsually, this is in sync with the reporting cycles and data is assessed every \nquarter. Afterwhich 6.

We encourage you to be \nopen to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your \noutcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? \n(300 words):\nRisks, Outlook, Prospects and Sustainability of Actions\nThere is an increasing amount of distrust of the authorities towards NGOs and \nthe changed legal rules that discourage networking is one such perfect \nexample. Going forward in the coming years it will be increasingly tough to \nwork on policy engagement and recommendations, it is better to adopt a more \n\u2013 model-based approach. There are also similar locational issues that are \nbound to impact the interventions. The project proposal rests on the premise \nthat climate-resilient model building and scaling with collaborations with state \nand non-state actors is the best way forward. And will address the mistrust \nwith some of the authorities. The pandemic has resulted in the state and \nadministration retracting a lot \u2013 with respect to the budgets and attention to \nthe urban poor and worker needs. It is expected that the welfare state and \npolicy provisions are bound to shrink in the coming years. Thereby recognizing \nthat policy-level engagements become further complicated. The silver lining \nthough is that the concept of climate resilience for informal workers may be \nthe most suited to this urban poverty team and its interventions for informal \nworkers at this stage of the intervention. As the issue is of prime importance \nto the state and authorities and will be more receptive to ideas and suggestions \nfor improving the same.\nOperational challenges: technical financial and partner-related risks.\n\u2022The change in the laws related to Foreign Contribution \nRegulation in India: The NGOs cannot use 20% of funds in \nadministrative expenses, thereby putting further restrictions in the \nmanner where collaborative and joint interventions will now be \nrestricted or must be strategically reduced to adhere to the guidelines. \nThese factors have been accounted for in the project design.\n\u2022The program design is based on network building and its \nchallenges:  Due to the changed law, the project intervention has been \nOak Application Form     24\nnow conceived wholly to be directly implemented by IGSSS. The \nerstwhile partners and networks of IGSSS in the form of CSOs, CBOs \nand networks will remain as joint actors for engagement and campaigns, \nand specific support will be extended to local CSOs who will be engaged \nwith and if needed capacitated to address the issues of climate \nresilience. Thereby imagining partnerships from the earlier formal \nproject-based collaborations to more organic issue-based non-financial \ncollaborations to allow for the transfer of knowledge and domain \nknowledge of emerging challenges of urban through networking at \nlevels and scales.  \n\u2022Stressing innovative approaches and income generation for \nCOVID realities: post \u2013 COVID economic slowdown and lack of \nlivelihoods are going to be a reality for the next five years. To kick-start \nthe interventions and to ensure the project aims for sustainable \npractices innovative models have been dovetailed into the proposals. \nLike \u2013 Worker resource centres, will ensure more accessible locations \nfor communities to get access to and resolve their livelihoods concerns. \nThese centres will be run by trained community volunteers. To \npropagate climate resilience for informal workers practice models will \nbe identified, documented, and scaled with support, and shared for \nwider implementation across CSO networks. Also, the COVID-19 \npandemic has brought a livelihood crisis that will be only ameliorated \nwith income generation and community institution/ membership models \nthat this intervention aims to support and nurture for the long term. \nThe following actions/ strategies are thought to ensure the viability of \nthe project: \n\u2022People-led actions and change: The principle of a rights-based \napproach is at the core of all programming under the proposed initiative, \nwhere the focus is on capacitating the workers belonging to the \nmarginalised sections of the urban to access their rights to identity, \nentitlements, and habitats and livelihoods. The focus on creating a \ncapacitated community leadership and cadre to lead the interventions \nwill also go a long way to ensure that the community efforts remain \nsustainable. Institution/ capacity building of worker collectives and \nstructures to ensure that the community owns and invests in all \ndevelopment actions planned and implemented in their contexts. This \nwould include worker collectives, CBOs, Self Help Groups, and City level \nfederations that are formalized and transformed to people\u2019s \norganizations and institutions. The networks and alliances created at the \nlocal, state, and national levels with diverse stakeholders and actors will \nlead to capacitated CSOs working on informal workers and climate \nresilience. Thereby far outliving the project duration. This will also \npopularize the informal workers and their climate resilience discourse \namongst the many networks and in the development sector in India.   \n\u2022Convergence and collaborations with state and non-state actors: \nConvergence and collaboration with resources and entitlements from \nthe government have been a central strategy underpinning the work \nwith communities. This will be promoted in this project as well \u2013 through \nlinkages with the already listed policy engagements, implementation of \nexisting laws and acts, as well as with the line departments and ULBs of \nthe urban areas. Expenses will be made on the least cost basis without \nOak Application Form     25\ncompromising quality. Low-cost meetings, workshops, exposures, \nconventions, etc. will be arranged so that these can be continued even \nafter the project period with minimal external financial support. \n\u2022Low-cost and climate-conscious project actions: Exploring new \nways of working together with minimal resources \u2013 for example, \ncollaborations with alliances and networks, sharing of knowledge/know-\nhow with like-minded institutions, and building up a strong case for \nevidential engagement through joint research and action. The activated \ncommunities and networks will be hoped to continue the development \nwork that they learned during the project time. Any support offered in \nthe name of model building and initial grounding of climate resilience \nmodels and income generational activities will be left with the \ncommunity itself. At an organizational level, it is further decided that all \nmeetings and gatherings hosted by IGSSS will avoid the use of plastic. \nAnd travels between cities will be promoted through rail only. Only in \ncase of large distances will air/flight will be considered.\n\u2022Phasing of project interventions: IGSSS has imagined and designed \nthis phase of work with informal workers and climate resilience for the \n2023-26 phase. IGSSS's understanding of informal workers, and \nsustainable cities have further improved in the last five years, and we \nhope to continue with our sustainable \u2013 resilient cities framework that \nthe urban team has devised for interventions. The proposed phase will \nhave its evaluations carried out and the strategy for further actions and \ninterventions will be decided in consultation with stakeholders and \nactors. It is expected that the program will be continued in at least one \nmore phase of interventions in the same area with the constituent \ngroups", "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11.  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS\nPlease use this space to respond to any specific questions from your Oak \nprogramme officer. If none were received, please leave this section blank. \nFirst Set of Questions responded on 17.02.2023\n\u2022The request is heavy on reaching out and collectivizing the workers and \ntheir families for claiming entitlements and services and less so on \ngovernment and private players\u2019 accountability towards them beyond \nensuring the entitlements\nComment taken and accepted; this could be tweaked in the proposal if \nrequired. But most of the focus initially (year 1) will be at building capacities \nof the collectives, starting with initial low-hanging fruits like entitlements, \nthen developing the worker settlements (which is very tough), then with \nsupport from CSO network groups could influence and reach out to \ngovernment and private players\u2019 accountability in year 2. As we move \ntowards year 3 and year 4, the focus will shift from collectivization to \nOak Application Form     26\ncollective action on objective2 (community level) and 3 (city/state \nfederations). Objective 1 actions will be led by the worker leaders \nthemselves.\nGovernment will be easier, but private players will be a challenge. As shared \nby you earlier as well, we can reach out / collaborate with jan sahas or other \noak foundation partners who are working with private players, that will make \nthe engagements easy to begin with. Please share any other suggestion that \nyou might have.\n\u2022Is there a plan to collaborate with technical organisations on issues like \nmitigating impact on migrant  workers from heat stress, air and noise \npollution ? in other words, build their resilience to the changing climate \n?\nYes, we have made sufficient progress on climate actions since 2020, when \nwe brought in the climate action as part of urban interventions. Rural \ninterventions have long had climate resilience building programs. In urban, \nwe are working with workers in behavioural aspects, as well as to secure \ntheir livelihoods and settlements. And are collaborating with numerous \nexperts and organizations on the same. Like CANSA, TERI, INECC and so on. \nBut we are also clear that it is only worker/ community collectives plus the \ntechnical support partners, who can combine think of innovative ways of \naddressing climate action for workers. As sometimes, it is easy to get stuck in \nthe technicalities and workers lose the connection with the climate impact \nissue, and solutions are not accessible, easy to scale and replicate. Lately, we \nhave pushed climate action for informal workers in our national networking \nmeeting and have just initiated small studies to assess the loss and damage; \nand propose/ frame actions/ policies for different workers. I will keep you in \nloop and posted of the same. Also, we with support frm hawker federation \nleaders are engaged in policy engagement and advocacy, and recently met \nILO and NitiAyog to push climate impact agenda of informal worker into \npolicy action.  Which they have agreed to incorporate.\n\u2022To what extent will the design be drawn based on inputs from primary \ncommunities?\nOh, very much. I think I answered this question above. It has to be based and \nled by primary / impacted communities. Or else climate action of mitigation, \nadaptation and resilience will not succeed. Mitigation might, but other two \nwill not. This is our experience of working on climate change in urban since \n2020.\n\u2022What is the expected cost of the project? do you have any committed \n/potential funding? what is the amount expected from Oak?\nWe have not calculated the expected project costs in detail but are looking at \ntentatively around 4 Cr for a 4-year intervention. We can think about raising \nlocal resources from other donors and existing programs / projects but will \nbe an expecting or seeking Oak to fund majority costs of the same. Will be \nbetter to discuss this and the scale of the program as well before arriving at \na figure.\n\u2022Explain what is IGSSS\u2019s experience on this broad topic? How will you \nprovide key advisory to government bodies to reduce climate impact on \nworkers who have to be in the open to carry out their work \u2013 like work \nOak Application Form     27\nwith the pollution control board and department of health? Who do you \nsee as the key ecosystem players?\nIGSSS is having extensive experience of over 12 years of urban poverty \ninterventions in urban. And increasingly, since 2020 we have through climate \nvulnerabilities and impact lens started to mainstream climate action with \ncommunities leading the change. We are having internal organizational \nexperience of working with rural climate change actions for over many \ndecades and that is helping us immensely in the existing/proposed work. We \nalso have a climate change thematic, that closely works with urban thematic \nto address urban poor / worker climate change issues. We can prepare a note \non the measures taken by urban team on climate change actions. IGSSS is \nalso working with governments across scales to push climate action and \nresilience building.\nFor impacting policies, the first step will be document the impact, calculate \nthe losses, place the requirements \u2013 demands from the community into \npolicies and laws for informal workers so to address the damages caused by \nclimate change. We are at this stage of the development and with urban poor \ncommunities we have carried out strong \u2013 successful pilots in 13 cities. With \ninformal workers taking examples from 8 cities, we are undertaking studies \nand engaging with policy makers to reframe climate policies wrt to urban \npoor and workers. The second step shall be to engage with the respective \nplayers, the welfare boards, the ULBs, the climate change ministry and other \npolicy think tanks of the state. Thereafter the next step will be to take it to \nthe implementation departments like PCB, health, and so on. The second and \nthird step we wish to undertake in this year.\n\u2022Please share some documents about IGSSS\u2019s organogram and board in \nIndia. Last information on the FCRA status of IGSSS will be useful.\nLast information on FCRA status is that it is awarded till March 2023. We \nhave not had any queries and the process was smooth. We are hopeful to \nhave the same approved very soon. Organogram and board details I will be \nsharing in the mail.\n \n \nSecond Set of Questions responded on 28.03.2023\nQuestions from the Director \u2013 India Programme and the President:\n\u2022References where IGSSS's work has been recognized by the policy and\nSome of the policy impacts are as follows:\n\u2022IGSSS contribution to NULM-SUH in 2011- 2012  \n\u2022IGSSS model shelters for women/ livelihood program for homeless in \nDelhi 2011-15\n\u2022Notification of holistic response for homeless during COVID outbreak \nMoHUA - 2020\n\u2022Notification for vaccination for homeless MoHUA \u2013 2020\n\u2022Notification of world homeless day in AP, MH, DL \u2013 2018 - 2022\n\u2022Notification for winter response and shelters for urban homeless by \nMoHUA \u2013 2021\nOak Application Form     28\n\u2022Rules for transgender welfare board in Madhya Pradesh by Social Justice \ndepartment - 2022\n\u2022Simplification of guidelines / operational manual for working with \ncommunities during COVID outbreak & contribution to NDMA NGO \ncoordination group \u2013 2020 \u2013 21\n\u2022National draft policy and acceptance by BMC for city level policy \u2013 2021 \n- 22\n\u2022Allocation by BMC for homeless shelters in Mumbai Development Plan \n2014-34 & Allocations in BMC budget \u2013 2015 & onwards\n\u2022First set of byelaws for street vendors presented to AMC \u2013 2022\n\u2022Policy improvement for slums on railway land \u2013 Surat Slum dwellers \nright to housing recognized. \u2013 2022\n\u2022IGSSS part of select organization to assist MoHUA in transformation of \nNULM 2.0 especially for NULM-SUH \u2013 2023\nIf you wish, we can prepare a set of annexures on the policy impacts that we \nhave had in as urban team. The annexures could be in the form of publications, \ncorrespondences, and orders.\n\u2022In the proposed request, what are the different levels in the government \nthat IGSSS plans to engage ?\nIn the proposed project, it is expected that the closest engagement will be with \nthe ULBs, and state government. Through the other existing project action and \nthe CSO networking in the proposed there will be engagements with the \ncentral level ministries and agencies. The most focus will be with ULBs and \nstate government, ministries and departments.\n\u2022What is the expected timeline of support from Oak beyond the four years' \nof this request ? what kind of sustainable funding sources does \nIGSSS have that may be invested in this programme?\nThe request is for 4 years for this project. We are heavily invested in informal \nworkers and urban poor communities and are hoping to continue our key \nflagship projects of satat shehar & punarnirman for urban poor and informal \nworkers in the coming years. And as a development agency, we have \ncommitted to our long-term engagement with urban poor and worker \ncommunities as constituency. It is also requested that at least one more cycle \nof project funding be supported, if possible, by oak with the same constituency \nto ensure the sustainability of actions and wider impacts.\n\u2022Given the similarity in challenges faced  by informal sector workers in \nother growing economies such as India, it will be useful to know whether \nIGSSS will draw examples on  how government and not-for -profits in \nthose countries are dealing with such challenges.\nYes, it is something that we are already are embarking upon. Especially \nexchange with global south countries/ cities and as well as more closely with \nsouth Asian / south east Asian partners. As many countries and cities are \nleading the discourse on climate resilience and we will benefit from working \nwith them. Like Bangladesh for example. We have already established \nconnections with networks there and hope it will help initiating a good \nexchange of thoughts, policies, experiences and practice.\nOak Application Form     29\n\u2022Is there any engagement planned with the National Disaster \nManagement Authority which is yet to fully apply climate-lens in dealing \nwith disasters?\nYes, it is planned and included in the scope to broaden the understanding of \nworking on the issue of urban disasters that are ignored as of now. Especially \nthe climate change related ones that are impacting informal workers and \nurban poor communities. Also, we were part of the NGO coordination group \nset by NDMA during COVID and contributed to the discussions then. \nTherefore, hopeful about converting some ideas/ interventions into policies.\n\u2022Given the large number of small and medium-sized entities that employ \ninformal workers, they may find it difficult to adapt the action plans that \nmay require capital investments \u2013  would you address this \ndirectly/indirectly?\nYes, I think there is an increased state support required for recognition of \naction plans, only through that eventually will entities and/or communities be \nable to address the challenges faced by them. This intervention proposed by \nIGSSS is not based on capital investment, but to facilitate that through \ncollectivization and convergence.  But this project may wish to show models/ \npilots that might need small supports to communities to facilitate the \ncreation of examples that can be upscaled by the state.", "12. DECLARATIONS": "12.

Our work is rooted in a theory of change built around the \npower of social movements to leverage systemic changes. It posits that \nmovements based in the grassroots are necessary for social and \nenvironmental change because: 1) they represent local agendas and are \ncomprised of the people with the greatest knowledge, experience, and \nstake in protecting their environment; 2) they have greater moral \nauthority to question and change systems that adversely affect them; and \n3) they serve as the roots from which larger movements for social change \ngain the motivation and inspiration to grow.\nGlobal Greengrants Fund was established in 1992, and over nearly three \ndecades has built a decentralised and participatory decision-making \nmodel, in which a network of 200 volunteer activist advisors sets our \nstrategies and makes grant recommendations, in addition to \naccompanying grassroots partners in their work through mentoring and \nother non-financial support. These advisors, organised in 25 advisory \nboards, sister funds and strategic partner organisations, are responsible \nfor identifying grassroots actors who are working to change the systemic \ncauses of climate change, environmental destruction and social and \neconomic injustice; and to strengthen these actors through flexible, \nresponsive and strategic funding and accompaniment. This advisory \nnetwork collectively represents our most powerful asset.\nSince 1992, Global Greengrants Fund has supported over 15,000 \ngrassroots initiatives around the world, almost 1,000 of them since 2013 \nthrough Global Greengrants Fund UK, the younger, independent sister \ncharity and applicant.

We do this through a decentralised, \nparticipatory grant-making model in which our network of over 200 expert \nlocal advisors identify grassroots movements; channel small, flexible grants \nfunding to them; and provide ongoing mentorship and accompaniment to \nthem as they deliver their self-determined initiatives. In 2013, Global \nGreengrants Fund UK was registered as an independent charity in England \n& Wales, with the first staff member joining the organisation in 2016.\nThe global organisation has grown significantly in recent years, and \ncurrently funds over 1,000 initiatives per year (including 217 through the UK \nentity in 2020-21). The UK organisation has grown its revenue and staffing \nresources substantially, and is on track to exceed $5m income for the \ncurrent fiscal year.\nGlobal Greengrants Fund\u2019s India Advisory Board was established in 2001 to \nsupport grassroots environmental protection and rights-based development \nwork through small grants and advisor mentorship. The Board\u2019s work covers \na diverse set of issues, from forest rights to water and sanitation, but with a \ncross-cutting focus on the most marginalised groups, including Adivasi and \nDalit communities; women; transgender people; and rural and remote \npopulations. The Oak Foundation has been the Board\u2019s longest-term and \nlargest donor since its inception, supporting the Board since 2012. This \nsupport from the Foundation has been critical to the Board\u2019s evolving \nstrategy: as one of the Board\u2019s only funders providing multi-year support, the \nOak Foundation has enabled the Board to develop relationships, networks \nand more in-depth understanding of the specific challenges facing the group \nit supports.\nWhile the growth of our support to grassroots movements is a major \nachievement of the past two years, the achievement we are most proud of is \nour advisory networks\u2019 ability to continue strengthening grassroots \nmovements within the extraordinarily challenging context of Covid-19; in \nIndia, with the support of the Oak Foundation, the Advisory Board was able \nto rapidly mobilise emergency grants to 11 local initiatives on the frontline of \nCovid response during the country\u2019s deadly second wave, and continues to \nprovide additional support to all its grantees affected by the pandemic as \nrequired.\nOak Application Form     7\n5c.

(600 words):\nContext\nOver twenty years on since the inception of the Global Greengrants Fund \nIndia Advisory Board, marginalised communities in India continue to face a \ncomplex, interconnected range of social, environmental, health and rights \nchallenges, all of which have been exacerbated significantly by the \nimmediate and longer-term impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and of the \nclimate crisis.\nRural women and marginalised communities, including Adivasis, Dalits and \nmigrant workers, have been disproportionately affected by the immediate \nhealth risk from the virus and by the effects of lockdown measures, including \nloss of income, food insecurity and exposure to violence; an estimated 75 \nmillion people in India were pushed into poverty during the first wave of the \npandemic alone. The effects of the pandemic have been especially \npronounced for the Adivasi communities supported by our Advisory Board; \nmany of the casual labourers who returned to remote rural communities at \nthe beginning of the pandemic have remained there, putting additional \npressure on already highly stretched local resources. Logging, mining and \nother activities harmful to the environment \u2013 both officially sanctioned and \nillegal \u2013 have increased, representing a major challenge to communities \nreliant on natural resources for their livelihoods, food, shelter and medicine, \ndespite the protections set out in the Forest Rights Act.\nSimultaneously, climate-linked disasters such as Cyclone Tauktae in 2021, \nflooding and landslides across multiple states particularly including the \nnorth-east, and the major heatwave of spring 2022, are destroying the \nlivelihoods of thousands of farming and fishing communities already facing \nextreme poverty and food insecurity as a result of the pandemic. As well as \nthe immediate threat to lives and property from disasters of this kind, \nclimate change is driving increased water scarcity, crop failure, soil erosion \nand the loss of biodiversity including fishing stocks.\nBoth before the pandemic and during it, local organisations and movements \nacross India have been the frontline responders to the intersecting health, \nsocial and environmental crises they face: identifying local challenges, \ndesigning solutions and mobilizing communities to carry them out. Through \nits grant-making and accompaniment work with emerging civil society \nactors, the India Advisory Board aims to strengthen these locally-led \ninitiatives, enabling them to become more effective in achieving their self-\ndetermined goals while also promoting a rights-based, inclusive approach to \nsocial and environmental justice work that is rooted in local agency, \nautonomy and dignity.\nThis grant-making and accompaniment work is also how we have identified \nthe specific challenges affecting marginalised groups in India: with the \nsupport of the Oak Foundation, our advisors have developed an analysis \nwhich is rooted in the perspectives and experiences of our grantee partners. \nOak Application Form     8\nThe proposed work is informed by this analysis and by Global Greengrants\u2019 \noverarching theory of change, which posits that movements based in the \ngrassroots are necessary for social and environmental change because they \nrepresent local agendas and are comprised of the people with the greatest \nknowledge, experience, and stake in protecting their environment; because \nthey have greater moral authority to question and change systems that \nadversely affect them; and because they serve as the roots from which larger \nmovements for social change gain the motivation and inspiration to grow.\nOur partnership with Oak Foundation and recent highlights\nAs mentioned above, the Oak Foundation has been supporting Global \nGreengrants Fund\u2019s India Advisory Board since 2012, with over 200 \ngrassroots initiatives funded and accompanied by our advisors in total \nthrough this partnership.\nIn the most recent phase of our partnership \u2013 the 2018-22 grant to which this \nproposed work links directly \u2013 we set out the following objectives:\n1) To support a total of 40-50 grassroots civil society initiatives in Jharkhand \nand West Bengal with small grants to enable action on environmental justice \nand climate change, aiming to strengthen their ability to effectively advocate \nfor their rights and implement viable solutions to local challenges; and in the \nmedium to long term, to strengthen their organisational capacity.\n2) To foster stronger networks among local civil society organizations in \nJharkhand and West Bengal, as well as across India, through a series of \ngrantee workshops and through grant-making to network organisations, with \nthe aim of grantees having increased resources including knowledge, skills \nand financial support to carry out their work.\n3) To promote women\u2019s rights, safety, well-being, and economic security \nthrough small grants to women-led and women-focused environmental \njustice activities (30% of all grant-making), as well as through advisors \nworking with grantees to support the incorporation of a gender lens in their \nwork, with the aim of securing an increased leadership role for women in \nenvironmental justice initiatives. Examples of the types of activity supported \nthrough this objective include women-led initiatives addressing forest rights \nand agriculture.\nDuring this most recent phase, 55 grassroots initiatives were supported with \nsmall grants to implement solutions for environmental justice and in \nresponse to climate change. The majority of projects focused on raising \nawareness of the importance of natural resource conservation, especially for \nwomen and youth, and orienting the communities towards organic and \nsustainable agriculture to improve livelihood opportunities, food security, \nand health. Projects also focused on strengthening grassroots institutions \nand local governance, supporting minority groups in obtaining and \nimplementing Community Forest Rights in the context of FRA2006, \nempowering Gram Sabha, and providing equal access to water and \nsanitation.\nKey learnings from this most recent phase of work include:\n\u2022Thirty-one percent of grantees who have reported have been able to \naccess additional funding as a result of the grant provided through the \nOak Foundation support. This includes funding from international \nfoundations such as Keystone Foundation, Foundation for Ecological \nOak Application Form     9\nSecurity, 350.org, Action Aid and AJWS, but also national government \nadministration (e.g. Forest Department of Jhrakhand, NABARD \n(National Agriculture Bank And Rural Development), Krishi Vigyan \nKendra (Agriculture Research Centre), and other national NGOs and \ninternational NGOs including MOCICC (Movimiento Ciudadano frente \na Cambio Clim\u00e1tico, a Peruvian NGO). In addition, forty-two percent of \ngrantees have told us that thanks to GGF\u2019s support, they have been \nable to benefit from new networking opportunities, increased \nrecognition and trust from the wider community, and general support. \nIn some cases, it was observed that the visibility gained is a gateway to \nadditional funding opportunities.\n\u2022Overall, groups observed a general inclination toward learning from - \nand helping - each other; forums and district-level meetings were \norganised to exchange lessons learned, experiences, and best practice. \nSome organisations have started to hold interactions with district-level \nNGOs, have been given opportunities to take part in stronger networks \nwith other grassroots groups, and have been invited to join \ninternational conferences.\n\u2022Several of the grants made also went to network organisations; for \nexample, one network organisation based in Karnakata is organising a \nseries of twelve national and regional level meetings to develop and \npresent an action plan regarding forest rights to policymakers. Access \nto these types of networks is critical for many of the grassroots \norganisations we support, who are often unable to access other \nsources of information and advice, and are able to share resources and \nstrategies as a result.\n\u202257% of grants made have been to women-led organisations or to \ninitiatives focused on women\u2019s rights, wellbeing, and economic \nsecurity. Women are more prominently represented in the leadership \nof their organisation and have been able to develop their leadership \nskills through the seminars or workshops offered by the projects. In \nsome projects, women's participation grew so much that they now \nrepresent one-third of the forest rights committee at the Gram Sabha \nlevel, where they often assume prestigious roles (secretariat, \npresidency, vice-presidency). In some cases, women are taking a \ncrucial role in decision-making and lead the negotiations with local \nauthorities.\n\u2022Eighty percent of the grantees who have reported have said that \nthanks to the Oak Foundation\u2019s support they have been able to improve \nenvironmental conditions at the local level. Organisations could \nmeasure an overall increase in the awareness and responsibility of \nlocal communities towards improving environmental conditions and \nsafeguarding natural resources, for example, through the set-up of \nForest Rights Committees, Village Forest Management Committees, or \nthrough campaigning. Benefits reported by the grantees include: \nincreased wildlife protection; restoration of water channels; farmers \nshifting to organic agriculture/ agroecology and no longer using \nchemical fertilisers and pesticides; regeneration of wastelands, and the \nreturn of birds, animals, and plant species.\nThemes in our grant-making to date, and emerging priorities\nOak Application Form     10\nWhile the Board\u2019s strategy focuses on the most marginalised groups, a \nnumber of cross-cutting themes have emerged across its work with these \ngroups across the different geographies within India where it works. The \nproposed work aims to leverage the Board\u2019s existing networks and expertise, \nand with the support of the Foundation to also develop new approaches, \nresources and capacity which can make it more effective in addressing these \nspecific themes and challenges. These themes include:\n\u2022Food systems and sustainable agriculture. Food security has \nbecome an even more urgent challenge for poor rural communities in \nthe context of both Covid and rising temperatures driven by the \nclimate crisis, with the continuing dominance of industrial agriculture \nthreatening the economic independence of family farmers as well as \nimpacting local biodiversity and soil conservation and acting as a major \ncontributor to carbon emissions. Three of our advisors are specialists \nin this area, with one living as part of a collective farm run by Adivasi \ncommunity members. For the proposed work, we anticipate that this \ntheme will continue to be an important one across all of the \ngeographies in India where the Board operates.\n\u2022Access to forest rights, especially for Adivasi communities. The \nBoard has supported multiple Indigenous groups across India to \nexercise their right to protect, make decisions, and make a living from \ntheir traditional forests in the face of extractive interests. Several \ngroups have been supported for a number of years in this work, such \nas one organisation in Jharkhand (funded by Oak since 2016) working \nto secure forest rights, survey forest produce and trees, and promote \nwomen\u2019s involvement in the Gram Sabha. Two of our advisors have \nstrong links to Adivasi community movements and this theme will \ncontinue to be prominent in the proposed work.  \n\u2022Addressing the impacts of climate change and industrial \npollution on small-scale fishing communities. Fishing \ncommunities, like farmers, have been deeply impacted by climate \nchange in India as cyclones hit coastal areas with increasing intensity \nand frequency and sea level rise changes coastal ecosystems. One \ngroup supported by Oak Foundation via Greengrants in West Bengal \nhas been working to restore and protect mangroves in three villages \naffected by Cyclone Yaas, for example; others are especially focused on \nbuilding the leadership, organisation, and economic independence of \nwomen in fishing communities.\n\u2022Waste and sanitation issues, especially in relation to Dalit \nwomen and youth and to transgender people. Waste picking and \nmanual scavenging (cleaning human waste) generally falls on the most \nmarginalised people in India, especially Dalit women and youth who \nare frequently unpaid and often suffer severe health impacts and \nabuse; this work is an increasingly prominent theme in the Board\u2019s \ngrant-making, and recent grants have supported the organising, \neducation on rights and health, and registration of manual scavengers \nin informal settlements of Bangalore; another grant has funded work \nwith transgender waste pickers in Kolkata to improve health conditions \nand connect them to broader environmental justice movements.\nOak Application Form     11\nIn the context of the pandemic, the Board has adapted its approach to ensure \nmaximum flexibility and support to groups on the Covid frontlines, including \nwith the support of the Oak Foundation. Our grantee partners have shown \nenormous resourcefulness and resilience throughout this crisis, whether by \nadapting existing activities to ensure the safety of community members, or \nby developing new lines of work such as Covid prevention and awareness \nactivities, providing PPE or addressing the food security implications of the \npandemic.\nThe next phase of our partnership with the Oak Foundation\nAs India begins to move into the post-pandemic recovery phase, the Board is \nlooking ahead to the next phase of its existence and aims to continue scaling \nup its support to marginalised communities across India, building on the \nBoard\u2019s experience to date and also on the findings of the evaluation \nconducted on the previous phase of our partnership (attached \nseparately).  The strategy for this proposed next phase of our partnership \nincludes, firstly, exploring opportunities to support groups which the Board \nhas had less engagement with to date \u2013 whether in new geographies, or \nthose affected by additional dimensions of disadvantage such as trans or \nintersex identities. With one of the newest Board members from a Dalit \nbackground, the Board also aims to deepen its engagement with Dalit and \nother marginalised communities in the next few years, including by ensuring \nits own composition reflects that of its grantee partners in terms of gender, \nage, caste status, religion and geographical background. This need for \nenhanced focus on Dalit and other marginalised groups is one of the key \nrecommendations of the evaluation of the previous phase of our partnership \n(see 4.1.3, paragraph 101 and 4.3 in the evaluation).\nSecondly, the Board aims to strengthen its support to existing partners, \nrecognising there is scope in its work to support emerging civil society to \nbecome more established organisations with enhanced capacity to address \nsocial and rights challenges and to be more resilient and sustainable in their \nwork. In particular, this includes two changes to the Board\u2019s grant-making \napproach: increasing the size of the average grant made from $7,000 \nto $10,000; and moving towards providing multi-year funding \ncommitments to trusted partner organisations. This longer-term \napproach to funding will also strengthen our grantees\u2019 accompaniment work, \nenabling advisors to develop their relationships with grantee partners and to \nsupport them in becoming more sustainable and effective organisations over \ntime; it follows the recommendation of the evaluation that the Board \nconsider extending the size and duration of grants made (paragraph 4.1.1). \nThese changes will also be complemented and strengthened by the Board\u2019s \nparticipation in Global Greengrants Fund\u2019s emerging global learning \nstrategy, which aims to connect the different parts of our global grant-\nmaking network more effectively to foster improved learning and \ncommunication; in part this also responds to the recommendation in the \nevaluation that the access of our grantees to expert advice be supported \n(4.2.1).\nFinally, whilst individual Advisory Board members usually identify and \nsupport grantee partners in a specific state or cluster of states, an important \naspect of the Board\u2019s strategy for fostering a stronger civil society network \nin India is to develop and share expertise on these cross-cutting themes \nacross different geographies within India. This is reflected in the grant-\nOak Application Form     12\nmaking budget lines of the proposed work, which include a split of 60% \ngrant-making for local initiatives in West Bengal, and the remainder for work \nin other states. We recognise that the Foundation\u2019s strategy for India is \nstrongly focused on West Bengal, which is a critical state for our advisors\u2019 \nwork; by requesting some support to be earmarked to other states, our \nobjective is to ensure that grantees participating in grantee workshops and \nother engagement activities have the maximum opportunities to benefit from \nthe work of allied and aligned civil society organisations across all of India. \nFor example, as mentioned above, in the current phase of our partnership \nseveral network organisations based outside of West Bengal have been \nsupported, enabling grantees within West Bengal and outside the state to \nbenefit from resources, strategies and information through this peer support; \nexamples of these organisations include DISHA (the National Fish-workers' \nForum); the Save Our Rice Campaign (through PPUS); the Asia Pacific \nTransgender Network; and the North Bengal Forum of Forest People and \nForest Workers (through Bajkul). Our objective is to continue \nstrengthening this wider ecosystem of grassroots peer support with \nthe Foundation\u2019s support. This approach also follows a key \nrecommendation from the evaluation conducted on the previous phase of our \npartnership, that supporting strategic networking will be key for improving \nenvironmental conditions (see 4.1.2 and 4.2.2 in the evaluation attached \nseparately).\nFunding context\nThe proposed renewal funding from Oak Foundation would represent a \nmajor contribution to the India Advisory Board\u2019s evolving approach to \nsupporting grassroots civil society in India over the next three to four years. \nThe Advisory Board has continued to be successful in growing its \nengagement with other funders, including new multi-year commitments from \nseveral foundation sources in the UK, Europe and North America; through \nGlobal Greengrants Fund UK this includes renewed contributions from \nStichting SED Fund and the Human Capability Foundation, as well as \nportions of larger grant commitments secured in the past six months from \nthree large foundation donors. Cumulatively, the India Advisory Board\u2019s \nannual budget for FY21-22 (closing 30 June 2022) stands at $600,000 \u2013 a \nlarge increase on the initial budget of $332k for the first year of the most \nrecent phase of our partnership in 2018-19. The Advisory Board\u2019s budget for \nFY23 and FY24 is $744,000 per year. (To set this into the wider context of \nGGF UK\u2019s overall financial situation, GGF UK\u2019s overall budget is projected at \n$6.3m for the current fiscal year, and $6.2m for the next fiscal year.)\nIf approved, the currently proposed work would mean that the Oak \nFoundation would remain a significant funder of the India Advisory Board \n(though still well below 30% of the total India Advisory Board budget), but \nwithin a more diversified portfolio of restricted funders, as well as \nunrestricted support from Global Greengrants Fund. The global organisation \nhas also significantly grown its unrestricted revenue in the past year, \nmeaning that if the Board\u2019s work expands during the reporting period the \norganisation will be well placed to increase its budget further.\nThe proposed funding would enable the Board to provide 45-60 \ngrants of up to $10,000 per grant to emerging civil society groups in \nWest Bengal and other states in India, including a number of multi-\nyear funding commitments. As well as testing the viability of this new \nOak Application Form     13\napproach, the proposed funding will enable our grassroots partners \nto directly impact tens of thousands of beneficiaries through their \ninitiatives, and to become stronger, more autonomous and better \nresourced organisations.\nWith the support of the Oak Foundation, the Global Greengrants Fund India \nAdvisory Board aims to work towards an overarching objective of supporting \nemerging civil society actors in West Bengal and other states in India to \nbecome stronger, more resilient against external shocks, and more effective \nin carrying out their self-determined activities to address the social, \nenvironmental and rights challenges they face. As a result of this work, we \nexpect to see our grantee partners become better connected, resourced and \nnetworked; more effective in mobilising community engagement and in \nensuring the participation of women, youth and marginalised community \nmembers such as Dalits, Adivasis and other disadvantaged groups; and \nbetter able to access funding from other sources, decision-making spaces, \nand media coverage.", "6.

Examples might include: (1) Research; (2) Provision of legal advice to...; (3) \nTraining on movement building for...\nBuilding on the previous phases of our partnership with Oak, through the \nproposed support the members of the India Advisory Board will continue to \nproactively identify emerging civil society initiatives working towards social \nand environmental justice outcomes. Prospective grantees will be identified \nthrough the advisors\u2019 existing and new networks within Indian civil society, \nwith advisors approaching new and emerging groups who may not have \npreviously encountered Greengrants or received funding from external \nfunders; advisors will also conduct scoping visits and meetings to understand \nthe strategies and needs of prospective grantees and assess their alignment \nwith Greengrants\u2019 model and priorities, as well as supporting them to \ndevelop funding applications where appropriate (in particular for the most \nnascent initiatives which may otherwise lack capacity for completing an \napplication). This initial scoping and grantee identification will also reflect \nthe Board\u2019s focus on individuals and groups affected by intersecting forms of \nmarginalization (see also Objective 3).\nGrants will be awarded through meetings of the India Advisory Board, which \nwill continue to meet between three and five times per year to consider \napplications received against its strategy and criteria, and to award small, \nflexible grants funding of up to $10,000 per grant, representing an increase \nfrom the Board\u2019s previous average grant of $7,000 per grant. This higher \ngrant amount is intended to reflect the increased challenges affecting civil \nsociety organisations in India with mobilizing resources; to reduce \nadministrative burdens; and to enable local actors to become more effective \nin planning longer-term initiatives. For this proposed work, this will for the \nfirst time include multi-year funding commitments of up to three years for \ngrantees who are known to the Board, and who have the capacity to manage \nOak Application Form     15\nthese funds and to become stronger as a result, with the aim of building \nstronger and more resilient grassroots civil society organisations in West \nBengal and the other states in India where grantee partners operate. Our \nadvisors will play a critical role in supporting this capacity development, \naccompanying organisations to identify and address gaps in their skills, \nresources and infrastructure; for some (though not all) organisations \nsupported, this will enable them to secure additional funding from external \nparties, while other movements will have more specific and time-limited \ngoals.\n60 percent of the project\u2019s grantmaking budget will be channeled to groups \nin West Bengal, and 40 percent to the rest of India and to national networks, \nto allow facilitation of connections and learning across states, both by \nfunding network organisations and through the work of our advisors to \nconnect grantees working on related challenges across several states.\nWhile the specific focus areas and activities of the funded initiatives will be \ndetermined by the grantees themselves, with the support of our advisors, it \nis expected that the following themes and activities will continue to be \nprevalent in this work, based on the key trends identified under the previous \nphase of our partnership with Oak:\n- Issues affecting the rights of Dalit and Adivasi communities and other \nmarginalised groups, such as access to forest rights and government \nentitlements; participation in Gram Sabhas; and access to water and \nsanitation. (See also evaluation section 3.3.)\n- Issues affecting the rights of fishing and forest communities, again \nincluding access to the provisions of the Forest Rights Act; food security and \nagriculture; and the impact of extractive industries and pollution on \ntraditional livelihoods and health.\n- Climate change mitigation and adaptation, particularly in relation to \nsustainable agriculture and food security and resilience against the effects of \nclimate-linked disasters.\n- Environmental justice, particularly including advocating for the rights of \ncommunities affected by extractive industries and deforestation.\n- Sustainable development, livelihoods and agriculture\n- Women\u2019s environmental leadership, incorporating an intersectional lens \n(see objective 3 below), including participation in decision-making spaces, \nwomen\u2019s leadership of movements and local initiatives, and addressing the \nrights of trans women, women from Indigenous and Dalit communities, and \nother women who are affected by multiple dimensions of disadvantage.\n7.2.a.

If your Programme Officer wants more information, we will ask you separately for a \nwork plan. Examples might include: (1) Research; (2) Provision of legal advice to...; (3) \nTraining on movement building for...\nThis objective links to the ambition set out in the previous phase of our \npartnership with Oak, in which we aimed to deliver a series of annual \nworkshops to connect grantees with each other, to exchange information, \nresources and learnings, and to foster a culture of mutual support between \nemerging organisations working on similar issues and challenges. With the \npandemic having prevented the workshops scheduled for 2020 and 2021, our \ngoal is to revitalise this work through a series of grantee meetings in West \nBengal and other parts of India, which will also incorporate a focus on \nstrengthening organisational resilience in the context of the pandemic and a \nOak Application Form     17\nchanging operating environment for many organisations; examples of this \ncould include training sessions on assessing risk, managing regulatory \nrequirements, and standardising operations, depending on the specific needs \nidentified by our advisors in discussion with grantees. By designing \nworkshops based on grantees\u2019 own identification of their needs in discussion \nwith advisors, our aim (which has been successful in previous years) is to \nincentivize and support grantee partners to participate in and shape a \ncommunity of civil society movements that has lasting impact beyond the \nlifespan of this grant.\nAs with the previous phase of our partnership, a portion of the grantmaking \nbudget will be used to support network and infrastructure organisations \nworking to build capacity for grassroots civil society in India.\nOur advisors will also continue to provide accompaniment and mentorship to \ngrassroots initiatives, including those funded in earlier stages of our \npartnership with Oak, as well as newer and emerging civil society initiatives. \nAdvisor accompaniment can include several different types of activity, but is \nalways provided where it is welcomed by grantees and never imposed on \nthem. Examples of the types of support our advisors provide include \nsupporting grantees to identify and tackle specific challenges in \nimplementing their projects; assisting them with developing relationships \nwith key external stakeholders, such as by facilitating introductions to \nrelevant officials or to media spaces; and strengthening leadership, \nparticularly of women, through fostering external connections or \nparticipating in capacity-building work, such as identifying resource needs, \nreviewing a funding strategy or supporting systems strengthening. Both the \ngrantee workshops and the advisor accompaniment will be critical to \nfostering stronger connections within and between the movements \nsupported by Greengrants, linking disparate actors and influencers and \ncreating collaborative spaces that are informed by grantee partners\u2019 own \npriorities and goals.\nAs one of the Greengrants network\u2019s largest advisory boards, the board will \nalso play a key role within Global Greengrants\u2019 evolving learning and \nevaluation strategy, which includes a focus on disseminating resources, \ntactics and information across the global network between advisors and \ngrantees working on related issues, but who may otherwise lack \nopportunities to learn from one another. This includes, for example, \nconnecting advisors and grantees around issues of safety and security, \nensuring that they have a good understanding of the mechanisms they can \naccess to support the rights of community members facing threats to their \nsafety, such as through the Environmental Defenders\u2019 Collaborative (hosted \nby Global Greengrants Fund); sharing expertise on topics including disability \ninclusion and trans rights; and exchanging examples of how advisors have \nbeen able to support grantees in addressing specific technical or legal issues \nin their work.  \nOur advisors in India, as with the rest of our global advisory network, will be \nsupported in this work by the Global Greengrants Fund Programmes team. \nSubrat Sahu, the Board Coordinator, will continue to liaise with Programmes \nstaff to ensure that the advisors are supported to identify and resolve \nchallenges in their grant-making and other work; as well as linking the Board \nto Greengrants\u2019 global learning, evaluation and network-strengthening work. \nPeer support forms an important part of Greengrants\u2019 advisory model, and \nOak Application Form     18\nthe regular advisor meetings included in the budget will serve as forums for \nadvisors to share their experiences and learnings, troubleshoot, and devise \nstrategies for addressing new challenges.\n7.3.a.

Objective 3 Activities and timeframe (bullet points):\nList in bullet points the main types of activities that you plan to to carry out to achieve your \nexpected outcomes. Please keep these at a high level and and don\u2019t include the full list of \nevery activity you plan to carry out, instead, concentrate on the type of activities this grant \nwill fund. If your Programme Officer wants more information, we will ask you separately for a \nwork plan. Examples might include: (1) Research; (2) Provision of legal advice to...; (3) \nTraining on movement building for...\nThis objective directly links to and builds on the goal within the previous \nphase of Global Greengrants Fund\u2019s partnership with the Oak Foundation. \nGender remains a fundamental component of the India Advisory Board\u2019s \nOak Application Form     19\nanalysis and strategy; through the proposed work the Advisory Board will \nseek to further strengthen its support to local initiatives led by women, who \ncontinue to bear a disproportionate burden from social and environmental \nharms, now including the impacts of the pandemic and the increasingly \napparent effects of climate change. Overall, we will continue to channel at \nleast 30% of all of our grant-making to initiatives either led by women, or \nfocused on women\u2019s rights, safety, wellbeing and socioeconomic status; \nprioritizing women\u2019s leadership in environmental justice movements remains \na long-standing strategic objective for Global Greengrants Fund.\nWe will complement and deepen this commitment to strengthening women\u2019s \nrights by also incorporating an explicitly intersectional approach within our \ngrant-making, including channelling greater support to initiatives led by \nwomen, LGBTQI+ people and trans people, especially including those who \nalso identify as belonging to other groups which have historically been \nmarginalised, including Dalits, Adivasis, migrant workers, Safai \nKamancharis, and members of religious minorities. The India Advisory Board \nwill identify opportunities to explore and learn from the specific challenges \nof intersectional grant-making in India through the grantee workshops and \nwill also seek to adapt its own practices where necessary to ensure that its \ngrant-making and accompaniment work reflect intersectional approaches \nand concerns, for example by agreeing that a minimum percentage of grants \nmade will be to initiatives led by women who also identify as Indigenous, \nDalit, LGBTQIA, or as having a disability. This is also expected to include \nwork to ensure that the Board includes members whose gender \nidentifications, sexuality, religious affiliations, socioeconomic background, \ncaste status and indigeneity status reflects a diverse range of lived \nexperiences that mirrors those of the Board\u2019s grantees, with the objective of \nensuring that these grantee partners are supported by our advisors in a way \nwhich upholds their dignity and independence.\nThe India Advisory Board will work to address this objective in their work \nwith the support of the Coordinator, Subrat Sahu, and the Greengrants staff \nProgramme team, including Greengrants\u2019 Director of Gender and Equity, \nUrsula Miniszewski.", "8. COOPERATION": "8. COOPERATION  \nHow will you involve others in your approach to achieving change? If you are \nplanning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived \nexperience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  \nWhy are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are \nchoosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you \nusually work? (300 words):\nThe most important partners for this work are the Global Greengrants Fund \nIndia Advisory Board members; the Board\u2019s membership currently comprises \nfive Advisors, including one in West Bengal. The Board is supported by a \nCoordinator and an Administrator. The Advisors are all experts in their fields \nOak Application Form     20\nwith deep connections to local communities and civil society. They are \nresponsible for identifying grassroots actors who are working to change the \nsystemic causes of environmental destruction and social and economic \ninjustice, and work to strengthen these actors through flexible, responsive \nand strategic funding and accompaniment. Through this model, Global \nGreengrants and the Advisory Board seeks to ensure that the lived \nexperience of our community grantee partners is central to the social, \nenvironmental and rights initiatives the Board supports. Advisors are also \nthemselves deeply embedded in networks of support for grassroots civil \nsociety, including through links to Adivasi and Dalit organisations, as well as \nfarmer cooperatives and academia.\nAs in the previous phase of our partnership with Oak, we will continue to \nwork in partnership with other regional and international organisations such \nas Prospera International Network of Women\u2019s Funds as a partner in the \nGlobal Alliance for Green and Gender Action, as well as 350.org, Earth Island \nInstitute, International Rivers and Pesticide Action Network. We will also \ncontinue to identify other potential partners internationally and within India \nwho are able to support our grantees\u2019 work, potentially including local \nphilanthropic actors; within India Greengrants already has good connections \nwith intermediaries, philanthropic organisations and implementing \norganisations including AJWS, Holdeen Foundation, Fund for Global Human \nRights, Azim Premji Foundation, and aims to build on and deepen these \nrelationships and others during the proposed grant period. This work will \nalso be supported through Greengrants\u2019 global fieldbuilding strategy, which \nseeks to work with existing and emerging philanthropic actors globally to \nunlock additional resources for grassroots movements; while this global \nstrategy is still nascent we look forward to keeping Oak updated on our \nprogress, and appreciate the input that you are already providing to shape \nthe strategy.", "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING \nThis section is twofold. Please tell us:\na) Monitoring and evaluation. How will you know if you are achieving your objectives? Please \ndescribe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is working. \nIf you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect indicator data or \nconduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.\nb) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more about or \ntest through this grant.\n(300 words):\nThe proposed work\u2019s approach to M&E is guided by an organisational \nlearning and evaluation framework designed on the basis of our theory of \nchange and our understanding of how environmental justice movements \ncreate and leverage social change. This incorporates tools including reports \nfrom grantees and advisors; grant-tracking systems; grantee surveys; \nlearning exchanges; participatory action research; grant strategy reviews; \nnetwork mapping; and in-depth regional case studies, to gather information \nabout the impacts of our funding on individual grantee organisations, \nOak Application Form     21\nbroader movements, and environmental and social conditions, and evidence \nof change. In-depth and longitudinal studies help us to map what long-term \naccompaniment and strengthening of a movement looks like.\nEach community group in receipt of a small grant and advisor support is \nasked to report on the progress of the project one year after receipt of the \nfunding. The reporting form asks for assessments and learning related to \neight indicators which align with Global Greengrants Fund\u2019s evaluation \nframework and help us assess impact:\n1. Any evidence of improved environmental conditions since receiving \nfunding\n2. Strengthened organisational capacity\n3. Increased community awareness or involvement\n4. Increased involvement of women, youth, and indigenous leaders in the \nwork of the initiative\n5. Impacts on policy or policy implementation\n6. Increased media interest in the grantees\u2019 work, if this is something that \nthe grantee seeks\n7. Increased access to spaces for decision-making and advocacy and \nnetworks\n8. Increased access to additional funding from sources other than \nGreengrants, or other forms of support (for example, expertise).\nIn addition, the report asks for a description of what the partner assesses to \nbe the most significant change, any changes in the external environment, and \nany lessons learned from the work. The reporting process invites our \ncommunity partners to reflect on their work and draw lessons. Reports also \nhelp advisors to analyse trends, inform the strategy-setting, and collate \nstories of success and learning; this data is collected by the Advisory Board\u2019s \nAdministrator with the support of the Coordinator, and analysis is conducted \njointly by the entire Advisory Board.\nThe framework set out above is designed to be as flexible and appropriate as \npossible for Greengrants\u2019 portfolio of grassroots, emerging civil society \ngroups who are highly likely to lack capacity to conduct monitoring and \nevaluation activities, and whose aims and approaches vary significantly \ndepending on the local context. Recognising this, Greengrants does not \ncurrently provide a more detailed framework for grantee partners to define, \nfor example, parameters for improved environmental conditions; the \nframework seeks instead to place grantee partners\u2019 own perceptions, rather \nthan externally imposed definitions, at the core of Greengrants\u2019 evaluation \nand learning work.\nFindings will be reviewed by Global Greengrants Fund staff and discussed \nwith advisors on a regular basis, including during virtual and (where \npossible) in person meetings, focusing on the impacts of individual and \naggregated grants, the challenges our partners face, and wider trends.\nAll advisory boards receive disaggregated data relevant to their \ngrantmaking, to help influence their future strategy-setting and decision-\nmaking, and improve the quality of support Global Greengrants Fund \nprovides. For the proposed work, we additionally plan to commission an \nOak Application Form     22\nevaluation in the final 5 months of the grant which will assess progress \nagainst the objectives outlined above, particularly including the degree to \nwhich the board has been able to incorporate an intersectional approach to \nits work, and any learnings from this which can be used to strengthen the \nboard\u2019s future grantmaking and accompaniment work. We will welcome the \ninput and feedback of the Oak Foundation in developing the terms of \nreference for this evaluation to ensure that it meets the Foundation\u2019s \nexpectations, particularly in terms of including grantee partners\u2019 \nperspectives.\nThe proposed work also links to Global Greengrants\u2019 evolving learning \nstrategy. This emerging piece of work, which will also intersect with the \norganisation\u2019s ongoing Strategic Journey, aspires to decentralise learning \nacross the Greengrants network and facilitate shared learning between \nadvisors and grantees across disparate geographies and themes. This will \nalso include evaluating the existing monitoring and evaluation framework to \nidentify opportunities for strengthening our approach and developing \nadditional insight that can strengthen our advisors\u2019 and grantees\u2019 work; this \ncould potentially include working with our grantees to strengthen their \nmonitoring and evaluation capacity.", "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGES\nWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your \noutcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?\nWe understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we \nexpect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be \nopen to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your \noutcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? \n(300 words):\nExternal high-impact risks identified for the proposed work include the \nongoing effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on communities with which we \nwork, and on the ability of our advisors to continue their grantmaking and \nmentoring support. The pandemic has had an enormous impact on our \ngrantees in India: lockdowns and travel restrictions represent a major \nbarrier to frontline community actors\u2019 ability to campaign, coordinate and \nbuild successful coalitions. To mitigate against these challenges, Global \nGreengrants has carried out several scenario planning exercises throughout \n2020-21 to help us navigate the impacts of the pandemic on our partners, \nand through our advisors we continue to apply maximum flexibility in our \nsupport to the activists and communities we work with.\nAnother external risk to highlight is the increasing frequency and severity of \nthreats to environmental defenders across the world. Global Greengrants is \nmanaging this risk by providing rapid, flexible and discreet emergency \nfunding to environmental defenders at risk identified by our advisory boards \nin Africa. We also house the Environmental Defenders Collaborative (EDC), a \npooled fund of 14 funders, which supports environmental activists by \nOak Application Form     23\nincreasing access to funding and strategic resources. We further work with \nother actors in the environmental space to increase understanding and \nimplementation of prevention and protection strategies, including in \npartnership with the Funders Initiative for Civil Society. Within India, we will \ncontinue to ensure that all the work supported complies with the \nrequirements of the FCRA and all other relevant laws and regulations.\nInternally, one risk with potentially major consequences is the risk of \nadvisors lacking capacity to deliver their work and / or facing burnout \nthrough stress, especially given the highly challenging external context and \nthe impact this is likely to have on advisors. To mitigate this, Greengrants is \ninvesting in an organisation-wide Organisational Care Initiative (OCI), \ncurrently being led by independent consultant Ishita Chaudhry, and which \nwill be coordinated by our new Director for People & Culture (starting \nSeptember 2022). The OCI aims to minimise the risk of staff burnout but also \nto actively promote a culture of care across the wider network, including \namong our advisors. The work of our Learning Consultant, Mateo Martinez \nAbarca, who is responsible for delivering our learning strategy and ensuring \nour advisors are connected with learnings and insights from across our \nadvisor network, will also be key in mitigating this risk.\nGlobal Greengrants Fund UK also maintains a risk register which has \nidentified key governance, compliance, financial, external and operational \nrisks as well as mitigation measures. The charity\u2019s trustees regularly identify \nand review the major risks to which the organisation is exposed. Both \nmanual and automated checks are regular invoked, particularly those \nrelating to the operations and finance of the charity, including through a \nfinance sub-committee of the Board, chaired by the Treasurer, which is \nresponsible for financial governance and risk management.\nIn addition to managing these internal and external threats, Global \nGreengrants Fund UK has in place a safeguarding policy, and jointly with our \nnetwork-wide Diversity, Equity and Inclusion working group has developed \nan internal code of conduct which aims to enable individuals engaged with \nGlobal Greengrants to uphold and safeguard the dignity, freedom and liberty \nof all people, in line with our commitment to developing and strengthening \nan enabling environment, and a culture of communication, trust and \nempathy, where the health, safety and the dignity of all persons associated \nwith our organisation, directly or indirectly, is given primacy.", "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11.  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS\nPlease use this space to respond to any specific questions from your Oak \nprogramme officer. If none were received, please leave this section blank. \nThere was mention of several of GGF\u2019s grantees maturing to the next \nlevel of funders, can you provide exact information on how many and \nOak Application Form     24\nhow much funding have been leveraged by the grantees independently \nand/or with GGF\u2019s support?\n27% of our grantees supported by the Oak Foundation have reported that \nwith Global Greengrants support they have been able to access additional \nfunding. Grantees have been able to secure funding from sources including \nAssociation for India\u2019s Development; ActionAid; The Asia Foundation; Both \nENDS; UNICEF; Millenium Alliance; Paul Hamlyn Foundation; Keystone \nFoundation; Oxfam India; and others.\nOur grantees typically haven\u2019t reported on the specific amount of funding \nleveraged from other sources, but the information that we have received \nindicates the following:\n\u2022Unspecified amount from Bosu Bigan Mandir for indigenous people \ndevelopment.\n\u2022Unspecified amount from Yuva Manthan Sanstha.\n\u2022Unspecified (\u201csmall\u201d) amount from government administration to train \nyouth members for a livelihoods initiative.\n\u2022Unspecified small grant from Foundation for Ecological Society for \ncapacity building of community forest rights management committees \nat the district level.\n\u2022INR10,00000 from Keystone Foundation.\n\u2022Unspecified additional funding to address the problems of food \ninsecurity due to COVID-19: from APPI for ration distribution in the \nBarwadih block of Latehar; from UHHIP to distribute rations in the \nBargarh, Bhandariya and Ranka block of Garhwa and from NCDHR to \ndistribute rations in the Mahaudand block of Latehar.\n\u2022Unspecified amount from AJWS for collaboration to further strengthen \nthe work of the campaign.\n\u2022Unspecified individual donations for things like construction of drinking \nwater wells, distribution of clothes, and solar lights distribution etc.\nIn addition, 23% of our grantees support by the Oak Foundation have \nreported that with Greengrants\u2019 support they have benefited from new \nnetworking opportunities and increased recognition from the wider \ncommunity. Organisations have been able to create more linkages with like-\nminded change players and access opportunities for further engagement and \ndialogue on issues pertaining to partnerships, collaborations, and funding. \nThis boosted organisations' capacity for knowledge-sharing and increased \nopportunities to access similar projects and mobilise government schemes \nfor action. Organisations also benefited from increased recognition and \nappreciation, exemplified by an increase of positive views towards the \ngrantees from the broader community. For instance, two organisations were \nconsulted by the national government and a UK-based organisation to \nprovide specialised pieces of training and knowledge on issues such as \nhuman trafficking, millet cultivation, and livelihood systems.\nGiven the ten-year long relationship with Oak, it will be good to know \nthe significant accomplishments/lessons drawn over these years. In \nother words, information on the impact GGF could make and the \nchanges brought about since their time of their association with Oak.\nOak Application Form     25\nThe funded work has strengthened individual organisations and the overall \ncivil society in India. Although not all have been able to access additional \nfunding from elsewhere, many have, and the majority report strong \nrelationships within and outside their communities and with organisations \nand individuals carrying out similar work in other regions. Through the \nnetworks they are a part of, grantees have been able to engage with state \nand national level bodies regarding forest rights, food security, and fishing \nrights.\nThe annual meetings arranged by Greengrants are a source of expert \nknowledge, in addition to being eagerly awaited solidarity events. The \nsources of the expert advice vary \u2013 from networks that they are part of (civil \nsociety, social movements) to academia and think tanks.  The critical support \nprovided by Greengrants is instrumental in access to more network meetings \nwhich are a source of information and knowledge. Some organisational \ngrantees are themselves experts in their own fields (and are recognised as \nsuch by the state) and provide expert advice to the community (from \naccessing entitlements, to access to larger networks, to plantations). While it \nhas not been possible to carry out these meetings during the pandemic years, \nwe are now starting to hold workshops again and look forward to sharing the \noutcomes of these with the Foundation.\nThe vast majority of grantees report that they have been able to make a \ntangible difference to their local environments thanks to the support of \nGreengrants and the Oak Foundation. There is a huge range of \nenvironmental improvements, from nurseries to organic farming led by \ntransgender people, to forest and mangrove protection and rejuvenation.\nIn all cases, communities are increasingly involved in and aware of the issues \nfacing them and the initiatives to combat them. Their skills and knowledge \nare increasing, and they have a strong understanding of the means at their \ndisposal. For example, some are using the Right to Information Act (RTI) \n2005 to get information and engagement with the state. In some of the forest \nvillages in Jharkhand, they were conversant with even the nuances of the \nScheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of \nForest Rights) Act, 2006, (popularly FRA), and used mapping for claiming \nrights.\nThe issues that the grantees are engaged with (livelihoods, forest rights, \nindigenous concerns, LGBTQIA+ rights, and access to urban housing and \nwater) are being covered more in the media.\nAlmost all the groups in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Madhya \nPradesh work with the indigenous peoples. Other marginalised communities \ncovered are small scale traditional artisanal fish workers (Maharashtra and \nWest Bengal), farmers (West Bengal, Tamil Nadu), and trans-persons (West \nBengal).\nMost of the grantee organisations were women majority or women oversaw \nthe project. One organisation was transwoman-led, and majority trans-\nperson. Women were articulate and present in substantial numbers during \nmost grantee field visits by our evaluator. In a few cases, women were a \nmajority. In some cases, the women were more articulate even when \noutnumbered by men. The focus on livelihoods, housing, water, and women\u2019s \nempowerment enables the participation of women even in adverse \nOak Application Form     26\ncircumstances. These are \u2018legitimate\u2019 basic rights and entitlements that can, \nmost times, still rise above divisive local politics.\nThere has been formal recognition and inclusion in state decision making/ \nconsultative processes for some of the grantees at the local (village, gram \npanchayat) level. One grantee\u2019s work has been promoted as a model by the \ndistrict administration. The networks that grantees are part of (right to food) \nhave been able to influence policy even at the union level \u2013 a significant \nachievement in the present environment.\nHow the mentoring helped organisations to \u201ccreate opportunities for \nsustainability strategies, including through securing other funding, \ndeveloping alternative income sources, or scaling up their solutions\u201d.\nSee above re other funding secured. The other way in which opportunities \nhave been created for increased sustainability is through the general \nstrengthening of networks and movements as a whole; organisations and \nindividuals are able to share learning, information and strategies as outlined \nelsewhere in this proposal.", "12.

We \nhave estimate reserves totalling USD 49,031,000 and no debt.\n \nThe largest change in Ipas\u2019s financial situation is due to changes in strategy of our \nlarge anonymous donor (LAD) that began in 2020 that negatively impacted Ipas\u2019s \nbudget as well as those of other INGOs dedicated to sexual and reproductive \nhealth and right (SRHR)\u2014support from LAD changed from $29.9 million in FY20 to \n$13.2 million in FY21 and has resulted in an organization restructure of our US \noffice, including a staff reduction (41 positions). Leadership worked to streamline \noperations, combining some departments and subcontracting out some \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\ninformation technology functions. This has required scaling down and re-planning \nprogramming, and we are being mindful to carefully navigate these shifts to \npreserve critical safe abortion programming, as we also improve collaboration \nwith partners. We have been moderately successful at increasing funding from \nsome of our existing donors and identifying new sources of funding.\n \nIDF was one of the recipients of a multi-country grant from LAD\u2014withdrawal of \nsupport from LAD negatively impacted IDF\u2019s operating budget by 40%. Like Ipas, \nIDF also mitigated this through strategic resizing and program changes and has \nnow successfully secured additional funds to overcome the impact of this and \ncontinue efforts to improve the abortion ecosystem in its program states and at the \nnational level.  \n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nIpas has worked for nearly 50 years to ensure that women and girls have improved \naccess to safe abortion and contraceptive care, which we consider crucial for \nimproved reproductive rights, health, and gender equality. Our efforts on four \ncontinents have improved SRHR for women living within a range of restrictive \nabortion settings. Areas of expertise include implementing evidence-based \ninitiatives to improve safe abortion access with governments, health providers, and \ncommunity organizations, expanding health workers\u2019 capacity and commitment to \nprovide abortion care, and conducting action-oriented research to advance \nreproductive rights, with a focus on centering the perspectives and needs of those \nseeking abortion care. Guided by a commitment to human rights, innovation, and \nsustainability, we are skilled at building relationships with diverse stakeholders at \nevery level of society, including within governments, institutions, and \ncommunities.\n \nIpas Development Foundation (IDF) is Ipas\u2019s implementing partner is India. IDF \nbegan work in India in 2001 to address the SRH needs of Indian women and girls, \nspecifically to reduce the incidence of unsafe abortion which continues to be the \nthird major cause of maternal mortality. IDF\u2019s presence in 10 states and women-\ncentered approach ensures that women and girls have improved knowledge, \nagency, and access to SRH care, including abortion and contraception. \nPartnerships with governments to achieve sustainability has resulted in: \nsustainable allocation of resources to support abortion care; consistent availability \nof essential equipment and supplies; increased numbers of trained providers to \nprovide high quality care; and strengthened national policies and technical \nstandards and guidelines to support a strong national abortion care program. As a \nresult of IDF\u2019s interventions, training, and advocacy, over 2,000,000 women and \ngirls have accessed services from over 5,000 public health care facilities (with over \n84% of these at the primary level).\n \nIDF\u2019s interventions in Jharkhand and West Bengal in previous projects supported \nby the Foundation have resulted in positive outcomes\u2014particularly in improving \nSRH knowledge among young women and girls, increasing service utilization and \ngreater recognition of SRH as an important health issue (please see Annexure 1). \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nIn Jharkhand, the endline evaluation shows statistically significant improvement in \noverall SRH indicators for knowledge, attitude, practices as well as stigma \nreduction, with the range of variation higher in the intervention group than in the \ncomparison area \u2013 the findings are supported by an upward trend in SRH service \nuptake in public health facilities. In West Bengal, qualitative assessment of our \nintervention reveals an overall positive impact in improving SRH of adolescent \ngirls (10-14 years) and young women (15-24 years)\u2014adolescent girls and young \nwomen reported increased confidence and ability to discuss SRH issues and \nfacility records show increase in utilization of SRH services in intervention \nfacilities. While the results are encouraging, there is a continued need for \nnurturing an overall enabling environment for adolescent and youth SRH in the \ntwo states\u2014some specific gap areas are mentioned in 6e.\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nIpas\u2019s programmatic strategy is based on the Ipas Strategic Framework which was \nrolled out in FY20. Ipas\u2019s Strategic Framework offers a vision and strategy for \nprogress on abortion access and rights that lead to programs that are fully \ngrounded in the local contexts of the countries in which we work. Ipas\u2019s Strategic \nFramework is based on our model for a sustainable abortion ecosystem. Ipas \ndefines the sustainable abortion ecosystem as \u201ca dynamic condition in which \nresilient local stakeholders and systems are actively accountable and committed to \nabortion rights and responsive to everyone\u2019s abortion needs.\u201d Ipas\u2019s Sustainable \nAbortion Ecosystem model recognizes that a single approach (legal reform, health \nsystem strengthening, community education and engagement) will not alone \ncreate real access for women and girls\u2014the full ecosystem needs to be addressed. \nUsing a human-centered approach with women at the center, our approach \nacknowledges that sustainable abortion care requires flexibility and prioritization \non how to collaborate with partners to achieve goals, and how to strike a delicate \nbalance across many factors. Our ecosystem model and strategic framework \nrecognize that sustainable abortion care must be driven by local stakeholders and \naddress multiple programming components to meet women\u2019s abortion needs. The \nSustainability Framework identifies eight programming components that must be \nunderstood for each local context to accurately assess needs, develop and \nimplement strategies, and monitor effective interventions. Underpinning the \nStrategic Framework is a continued commitment to a human rights and gender \nequality. Ipas articulates our work within a human rights analysis, and we partner \nacross movements to advance the bodily integrity of all people.\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nYoung Indian women and girls face tremendous challenges and stigma in meeting \ntheir SRH needs and the COVID-19 pandemic has made accessing information, \ncounselling and support, and services even more difficult. Young girls who marry \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\nearly are more likely to experience extreme social pressure of proving fertility and \nbear their first child before their body is ready for childbearing. As per latest NFHS-\n5 (2019-20), 42% of young women in West Bengal aged 20-24 years got married \nbefore the legal minimum age of 18 years, while among men around 20% aged 25-\n29 years got married before the legal minimum age of 21 years (IIPS 2020).  A \nsimilar trend is observed in the intervention district of 24 Parganas (South)\u201442% \ngot married before 18 years (IIPS 2020). The situation is somewhat similar in \nJharkhand. As per NFHS-4 (2015-16), 38% of women aged 20-24 years got married \nbefore the legal minimum age of 18 years, while among men around 31% men aged \n25-29 years got married before the legal minimum age of 21 years. Early marriage \nfurther leads to high teenage pregnancy\u2014in West Bengal 16% of women ages 15-19 \nyears were already mothers or pregnant at the time of survey, this was 13% in 24 \nParganas (South). Given these, young women constitute 30% of total maternal \nmortality in the country. The highest maternal deaths (34%) in India are also \nrecorded for young women ages 20-24 years (RGI 2019).\n \nMore than 33% of the disease burden and almost 60% of premature deaths among \nadults can be associated with behaviour or conditions that began or occurred during \nadolescence (GoI 2014).\n \nIpas\u2019s partner in India, IDF, implements community-focused interventions in \nJharkhand and West Bengal to address this, while also addressing specific gaps that \nwere revealed during the evaluation of the previous grant.\n \nJharkhand\nIDF\u2019s work under previous grants from the Foundation has yielded positive \noutcomes (please see Annexure 1); however, some key gap areas from the previous \ngrant include:  \n1) Women\u2019s agency around SRH-related decision making, negotiation skills with \nfamily members, and personal mobility is limited\n2) Socio-cultural barriers including gender norms that impede women\u2019s self-\nefficacy for SRH\n3) Men\u2019 involvement\u2014IDF\u2019s work through male youth leaders has improved men\u2019s \nattitudes towards women\u2019s SRH needs and interspousal communication, but more \nwork is needed to improve their acceptance of contraceptives and strengthen their \nability to support their spouses in negotiating SRH discussions within \nfamilies/communities\n4) Need to decentralize SRH services for improved access\n \nOpportunities:\n\u2022Strong foundation for a favourable SRH ecosystem established in the \ncommunity\n\u2022Community-based evidence to guide strategies on addressing continuing \nSRH gaps and evolving needs of young women\n\u2022health system interventions for holistic impact (through separate IDF funds)\n \nChallenges:\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139\n\u2022Potential government COVID-19 restrictions\n\u2022Resistance from the community due to fear of the pandemic\n \nWest Bengal (WB)\u2013 existing intervention areas\nThe often-overlooked SRH needs of adolescents and young women \u2013 particularly \nyoung adolescents (10-14 years) \u2013 are unique and critical, as early intervention \nlays the foundation for positive SRH outcomes.

Evaluation\nHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):\nIpas will monitor the progress and efficacy of facility-based interventions through \nroutine data collection from all intervention health facilities, including HWCs, in \nboth Jharkhand and West Bengal. Monitoring data will be collected and analyzed \nto review: trends of utilization of SRH services; age-disaggregated data of young \nwomen and girls receiving services, including abortion; referral support provided, \nand quality of services offered. Results will be shared with providers, community \nintermediaries, and youth leaders for continued improvement in quality of \ninformation and service provision to young women. We will also conduct joint \nanalysis sessions with service providers to transfer data-related skills of data \ndisaggregation and analysis.\n \nField-level monitoring of community outreach work will be led by the state-based \nProgram team in close collaboration with the youth leaders and their supervisors \u2013 \nthe teams will conduct quarterly meetings to review data on community meetings \nand outreach activities, assess progress, and modify strategies as required.\n \nIn existing intervention areas, pre- and post-exit interviews with young women \naccessing SRH services at intervention facilities will reveal the perception of \nquality of services by adolescents and young women and attributes of accessing \nSRH services at public health facilities. Community-based endline assessments will \ndemonstrate the impact of our community outreach in improving the overall \necosystem for SRHR (scope and methodology to be decided by the end of Year \nOne).\n \nIn new intervention areas in West Bengal, community-level evaluations will \nexamine the initial effectiveness of our interventions. Using a quasi-experimental \ndesign baseline research will assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards \nSRHR issues, as well as agency and gender equity-related aspects among young \nwomen. Partners of young married women will also be surveyed to assess their \nrole. In addition to setting benchmarks for selected output indicators, the baseline \nstudy will help identify barriers and facilitating factors to SRH services.

(300 words):\nThe Fund was founded in 2002, initially with a registered office in the US and \nthen in the UK in 2013. Until late 2020 the Fund was led by its founding CEO, \nRegan Ralph, who stepped down after 20 years of inspirational leadership. In \nMay 2023 the Fund\u2019s new CEO, Gabriela Bucher, joined. During this \nleadership transition the Fund\u2019s Deputy CEO, Brandee Butler, has been Acting \nCEO. The Fund\u2019s leadership team is currently five members who collectively \nprovide leadership and guidance to over 60 full-time Fund staff based all over \nthe world.  Our Program staff are based in the regions where we have a \nprogram presence. In addition, each regional program has a part-time or full-\ntime consultant based in a different priority country who serves as an essential \nmember and key advisor within the team.\nThe Fund\u2019s global board of directors currently has eighteen members, and is \ncomprised of high-profile human rights experts, frontline activists and \ncommitted human rights grant-makers and donors.  Board terms are three \nyears, and the Fund\u2019s bylaws state that the Board cannot include more than \nfive directors who have served over three terms.  According to the Fund\u2019s by-\nlaws, at least one-third of the board members must be \u201cof or from the regions \nserved.\u201d  The Fund\u2019s board meets in person twice a year and virtually twice a \nyear, and additionally has several standing board committees that meet \nthroughout the year.

We value diversity in all its forms \u2013 of thought, \nbackground, identities, and lived experience \u2013 in the composition of our \nteams and our recruitment of new staff. Specifically in relation to advancing \nrace equity, in recent years the Fund has made concerted efforts to further \ndiversify its board and leadership team, one example being that during the \nprocess of hiring our new CEO the Fund deliberately worked with a global \nrecruitment consultancy to support us in our search, with a priority focus on \ncandidates who would bring race diversity to our leadership.\n 5b.

(300 words)\nThe Fund is well positioned to remain a critical funder and ally to activists, \ngroups and movements on the frontlines of human rights struggles in the \nregion. The Fund began working in India in 2003, choosing to focus on the \nhuman rights dimensions of poverty and funding a combination of national and \nstate-level groups that worked with the most marginalized populations (Dalits, \nOak Application Form     6\nTribals, informal sector workers and women across all marginalized groups). \nSince then, the Fund has disbursed nearly $20million in grants to around 200 \ngroups across India. Over the years, with Fund support, these grantees have \nmade a significant impact on the human rights landscape in areas such as land \nrights, labor rights, and sexual rights, and in particular for extremely \nmarginalised communities (Dalits, Tribals, etc.). The Fund typically supports \na strategic cohort of 35-45 groups in India with an annual budget of roughly \n$1.2million. When strategic funding opportunities arise we are able to expand \nour grantmaking portfolio and reach, as our previous support from Oak has \nenabled us to do.\nThe Fund\u2019s India Program currently has a grantmaking portfolio of around 40 \ngrantees, including a few groups based outside of India who are some of the \nmost impactful actors able to advance international advocacy and media \nefforts as those based in India simply cannot due to the security risks and \nhostile environment.\nOur three key achievements related to our India programming include:\n1.The Fund remains a key ally and lifeline to activists: the Fund is \nnow one of a few human rights funders still able to work in India and \nchannel resources to the grassroots level, in part due to our deliberate \nefforts to operate under the radar and with grantee security and \nconfidentiality remaining our top priority. In the context of India, this is \na major achievement. The Fund\u2019s critical support to frontline activism \nincludes our continuing support to the Legal Defense Fund, one of the \nonly mechanisms of its kind in India \u2013 created to provide urgent \nresources to HRDs and organizations in emergency situations in India, \nespecially related to cases of criminalization. This unique rapid response \nfund was set up four years ago in collaboration with Holdeen and \nAmerican Jewish World Service, first incubated at the Fund and for \nsecurity reasons now housed at the Robert Kennedy Centre in \nWashington DC. Requests for support are peer reviewed by leading \nactivists. In the last three years almost 70 HRDs at risk have received \nemergency grants through this initiative for urgent legal assistance, \nemergency medical care, relocation, etc. Almost 70% of HRDs supported \nso far by this mechanism have been those working on environmental \nissues.\n \n2. A major priority of the Fund\u2019s programming in India is to support newly \nformed grassroots groups who are able to use the flexible, general \nsupport funding we provide to build a strong foundation for their work. \nFor some, our funding \u2013 often seed grants \u2013 can be \ntransformational. The majority of Fund grantees in India are also led \nby those who are from the same constituency that they work with \n(including women, Dalit, Muslim and Adivasis).\n \nThe Fund strives to support activists and groups working innew and \ncreative ways to advance human rights and social justice and to \nbroaden their constituencies, in particular to youth. For example, the \nFund\u2019s support has extended to activists using arts and culture to help shift \npublic narratives, such as in 2018 we partnered with Marathi YouTube \nchannel BhaDipa and the media and arts collective Maraa. Together, we \nOak Application Form     7\nhelped underrepresented voices break into India\u2019s booming stand-up comedy \nscene. On our 16-city tour of Maharashtra, comics from some of India\u2019s most \nmarginalized communities shared their personal stories, laughs, and \nimportant messages of social change with new audiences across the state. \nAnother example is the Fund\u2019s recent support to a collective of artists (incl. \npainters, writers and actors) that are working to amplify the voices of \nmarginalized communities affected by the climate crisis and environmental \nhazards and to raise awareness on and mobilize community-led ecological \nconservation. This includes a cultural festival on World Water Day, and \ncommunity -led cleaning of the Nonadaanga pond - a part of the East Kolkata \nWetland under threat from urbanization which is the only Ramsar site in the \nworld whose rich biodiversity has the ability to recycle the city\u2019s sewage into \nprofitable agriculture and fishing that could help feed the city at low cost.\n5c.

(600 words):\nProblem Analysis\nThe consequences of climate change in India - including eroding coastlines, \ndestroyed ecosystems, catastrophic weather events and poorly designed \nclimate mitigation and development projects - are deepening existing \ninequalities. Climate change is a threat multiplier, and populations in India \nthat already are vulnerable because of factors such as geography, poverty, \ngender, indigenous or minority status, national or social origin, birth or other \nstatus, and disability, continue to face its harshest effects. The nexus of the \nclimate crisis and socioeconomic and political inequalities is at the root of \nvarious types of climate injustices in India, and this is particularly pertinent in \nthe state of West Bengal.\nWest Bengal is a very unique state in India that is still grappling with the \neffects of its contested history under British rule, and the post-independence \npolitical and economic stagnation that followed after years of being one of the \nrichest regions in the world. Today, West Bengal has a fragile economy and is \none of the poorest regions in India, attributed, in part, to years of communist \nrule that shunned industrialization and modernization, and the growing effects \nof extreme weather \u2013 such as flooding \u2013 that together are leaving many families \ndestitute and are driving people to migrate to other states. Yet at the same \ntime, West Bengal is home to some of the richest biodiversity and natural \nresources in India, including pristine forests with diverse fora and fauna, much \nof which have been carefully preserved and protected by tribal communities \nand other forest-dwelling communities who have lived there for centuries and \nare highly dependent on the forest for their livelihoods and food sovereignty.\nHowever, West Bengal\u2019s ecology and pristine forests, as well as the lands, \nlivelihoods, culture and identity or the many indigenous communities that \nreside in them are increasingly under serious threat from a growing turn \nOak Application Form     8\ntowards major investments in development, natural resource extraction and \nhighly urbanized practices. One of the recent examples is the proposed \nDeocha-Panchami- open cast coal mining project of West Bengal State which \nsupports the eviction of many communities.\n \nFurthermore, whilst there are solid laws in India to protect the community \nrights of indigenous groups, as well as the land they inhabit \u2013 such as the \nForest Rights Act (FRA) \u2013 implementation of these laws remains poor, and \nrecent amendments in laws related to forests and the environment at both \nstate and central government level have been contradictory and difficult for \ncommunities and civil society to predict and respond to. Majoritarian \ngovernance is also eroding constitutional democracy and the rule of law, and \ndisempowering communities. Recent policies and actions have supported \ncorporate mining and other interests, such as in 2021, India\u2019s Ministry of \nEnvironment issued an order to help some mining projects avoid public \nenvironment clearance hearings which are a critical tool for good governance \nand an important process for mining-affected communities, who may be \nsuffering from non-compliance of mandatory environmental safeguards in \nmining projects. India\u2019s Wildlife Protection Act has also been responsible for \nthe large-scale relocation of tribal communities, and an increased \ncriminalization of forest communities, as documented in this recent report by \nCentre for Police Accountability.\nThis deeply concerning trend is intensifying and happening within a broader \ncontext of civic space and activism being severely curtailed across India as the \nstate seeks to silence all dissent; today, India is one of the most dangerous \nplaces in the world to be a human rights defender (HRD), especially for those \nadvocating around environmental issues who are easily labelled as threats to \nnational security.\n \nThe Fund\u2019s Response & Learning\nThe Fund\u2019s work related to environmental issues in India is currently focused \nin Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal and more recently expanded to \nChhattishargh and Jharkhand. However, the Fund has deepened its strategic \nfocus and investment in West Bengal in recent years considering the needs on \nthe ground and the critical window of opportunity the current moment \npresents in this state as it is on the cusp of major development and greater \ndemands on its land and natural resources. The Fund knows that in the face \nof these growing threats it is imperative that local communities, particularly \nindigenous and forest-dwelling communities, be supported now to elevate \ntheir voices and power to demand their constitutional rights to land and access \nto natural resources, before private sector interests and deforestation take \nhold.\nOver the last few years, thanks to Oak\u2019s support, the Fund supported a number \nof community-led efforts in West Bengal to promote and protect the rights of \nindigenous and forest-dwellers affected by environmental issues, large \ndevelopment projects, land displacement, and forced evictions. We have \ngathered important learning about the most effective strategies to help \ncounter and navigate the growing threats outlined above, which have informed \nour strategic priorities in the years ahead and for which we are seeking Oak\u2019s \ncontinued support and partnership.\nOak Application Form     9\nAs many climate solutions are inextricably linked to social and economic \njustice in India, the Fund has supported advocacy and lobbying efforts with \nthe government to ensure indigenous communities\u2019 identities and culture are \nprotected, as well as on promoting food sovereignty and sustainable \nagricultural practices.\nFrom our experience we have learnt that climate change can be mitigated, and \nenvironmental justice facilitated when communities are economically resilient, \nwomen have equal and equitable access to resources and to power, younger \npeople feel stronger community connectedness, and citizens are collectivized \nand have the knowledge of laws and policies that impact them and their \nenvironment.\nThe Fund is pleased to report that through Oak\u2019s current grant for work in \nJhargram, West Bengal, local groups and activists have made significant in \ntheir work over the last few years, and the results of this are extremely \nencouraging, and on which we are seeking to build. Over the last few years:\n\u2022Targeted communities in Jhargram, Purulia and Bankura have \ndemonstrated increased capacity to self-organize and claim their \ncommunity/individual forest rights.\n\u2022Perhaps most notably, at the time of writing this, up to now communities \nhave been supported to form 15 Gram Sabhas - 9 in Nayagram Block and \n6 in Binpur II Block - and so far 8 are in the process of claiming \ncommunity forest rights, with others are in the process of preparing \ntheir claims for submission. These 8 claims in process represent the \nrights of a total of 584 families and land 1,597 hectares in size, which \ndemonstrates the huge reach and potential impact of community-level \ninstitutions like Gram Sabhas and their collective action.\n\u2022Another inspiring outcome has also been that some leaders of Gram \nSabhas took initiative to form a platform/network of local Gram Sabhas \n- Banadhikar Gram Sabhas Mocha \u2013 which has since held two annual \nconvenings of local Gram Sabhas, involving local leaders and forest \nrights activists from a number of villages. The last convening, held \nearlier in 2023, was attended by 200 people which demonstrates the \nappetite for such platforms and spaces. The convening included rich \ndiscussions. Banadhikar Gram Sabhas Mocha has also been able to \nsuccessfully liaise with and advocate with the District Magistrate and \nother District officials in instances where Gram Sabhas claims are not \nbeing responded to, helping to amplify communities\u2019 voices and \nconcerns. Another positive development is that the organizers of this \nMocha are now engaging themselves in discussing livelihood issues. The \npotential of this platform is extremely promising.\n\u2022One of the most important achievements noted by our grantees has been \nthe change in attitude of government departments towards the forest \nrights campaign and work in Jhargram. When they started the work and \nhelped Gram Sabhas to submit claims after meticulous preparation, \nnone of the government departments showed any interest, rather they \nwere actively discouraged from filing submissions. After two years of \nhard work and regular engagement with District officials, they are now \npublishing a booklet about the FRA, Gram Sabha and forest rights \nclaims, publishing and circulating claim forms. The District Magistrate \nis now also promising to look into claims submitted and giving \nOak Application Form     10\ninstructions to his subordinate officers on the same and most \nimportantly, the Forest Department is acknowledging the process and \nsending Forest Officers to talk about FRA claims in a gathering \norganized by the very same community, with whom they share a \ncontentious relationship. This is a major shift and step forward for State \nrecognition and action in relation to community forest rights.\n \nKey learnings from our work in West Bengal so far have shown that:\n- the most important and effective way to engage and mobilize indigenous \ncommunities to claim their rights to land is to equip them with greater \nunderstanding of the connection between their cultural identity, traditional \npractices and customary laws, to the protection of and access to land. We have \nseen through our grantees\u2019 work that focusing on this intersection \u2013 helping \npeople to see that land is not just a resource but part of indigenous cultural \nidentity \u2013 is the most powerful and successful way to empower and mobilize \ncommunities for action.\n-equipping communities with a greater understanding of their constitutional \nrights and legal provisions is critical\n- supporting efforts to strengthen the forest governance structure through \npeople centric conservation practices through constitutional remedies such as \nthe PESA, FRA etc. allows communities to demonstrate the meaning of \nconservation and protection of their natural resources\n- supporting communities to mobilize, form Gram Sabhas and process \ncollective claims takes considerable time, accompaniment and trust-building, \nbut is an essential process in empowering communities and ensuring the \nrealization of their rights\n- communities need sound legal aid in order to claim their rights and respond \nto emerging threats, including criminalization by the state.\n \nSupport from Oak\nThe Fund seeks a new 4-year partnership with Oak and a grant of $575,000 to \nhelp bring the resources and actions needed in this critical moment for \ngrassroots level organizing on land and resource rights issues in West Bengal. \nWith Oak\u2019s support the Fund would build on the success and learning from \nprevious work and support a cohort of 4 local groups working on their \ncommunities\u2019 management of and rights to natural resources in West Bengal, \nlikely focused in Jhargram, Purulia, Paschin Bardhaman, Bankura, Alipurduar \nand Cooch Behar Districts. The Fund would continue to support 2 existing \ngrantees and seek to expand support to 2 new grantees. With Oak\u2019s support \ngrantees will receive the resources and support to build on their work, \nprogress and learning so far, with a deepened focus on building community \nawareness of the power in their cultural identity and heritage, its connection \nto land, and in pursuing their constitutional rights to land ownership and \naccess. Grantees will be able to continue supporting communities to claim land \ntitles, to scale up their outreach and mobilization efforts into new areas, and \nto advocate for West Bengal\u2019s Forest governance structure to be \nstrengthened, ensuring communities have the power and voice in the process \nthrough building grassroot mobilization of community-based organisations \nOak Application Form     11\nsuch as Banadhikargram sabha morcha and Uttar Banga Vanjan Shramajeevi \nManch.\nAs far as our grantees liaising with the government departments, this will \nhappen to some extent, especially with district administration, forest \ndepartment, and nodal agencies such as the Department of Backward class \nwelfare who is primarily responsible for the implementation of Forest Rights. \nHowever, grantees likely will not lobby or advocate directly with these \ndepartments since the Gram Sabha Morcha \u2013 an important people\u2019s \nnetwork/forum- will take the lead in having direct dialogue with government \ndepartments on behalf of its communities. Similarly, North Bengal groups will \nengage with such departments since they are already working on forest rights \nalthough it is not directly supported by our funds.\nOur proposed work would align strongly with the Fund\u2019s strategic priorities \nto shift more resources to grassroots environmental activists and solutions in \nIndia, to build indigenous communities\u2019 resilience and power on \nenvironmental issues and their rights, to support intersectional approaches \nto activism, and to help nurture a grassroots climate justice movement that \nhas indigenous communities, women and youth at its heart and helm.", "6.

Monitoring and evaluation:\nThe Fund has developed a strategic framework for each country that guides \nthe Fund\u2019s allocation of its resources and provides a means for evaluating its \ngrant-making over time. Each grantee will be required to submit a proposal \nevery year outlining their proposed work and goals for the year ahead and \nproposed qualitative and quantitative indicators to track developments and \nprogress. The Fund\u2019s program staff in India will then speak with each grantee \nto jointly set indicators \u2013 aligned to what we have outlined in this proposal - \nthat they will use to determine whether their efforts are moving in the desired \ndirection.\nThe assessment of these indicators is done typically through six monthly \nnarrative reports.  Alongside these grantee reports, the Fund\u2019s program staff \nin India will maintain regular communication with grantees \u2013 likely every \nquarter - as an important part of building strong relationships rooted in trust, \nand to help maintain open discussions on progress and challenges on their \nwork and strategies. Fund staff will also visit grantees regularly to accompany \nthem in their work, to deepen discussions around strategies, and to encourage \nongoing reflection and learning.\nThe Fund recognizes that no work happens in isolation; it can have planned \nand unplanned impact, just as the emerging social, cultural and political \ncontext can impact the work in foreseen and unforeseen ways. During its \ndiscussions with grantees, the Fund\u2019s major role is as a thought partner who \nOak Application Form     15\ncan help the grantee understand the role and impact of their organization not \njust in its own silo, but also in the context of the broader eco-system of \norganizations. The Fund also provides guidance, and where possible additional \nsupport and resources, to also support grantees to build their capacity, \nleadership and ensure their sustainability. In India, the Fund does this with a \nparticular focus on promoting the development of second line leadership \nwithin its grantees and ensuring the younger generation of activists are \nelevated.\nb. Learning:\nThe Fund is increasingly nurturing a learning culture and sees learning as an \nongoing and self-reinforcing process. Through the ongoing monitoring and \nevaluation efforts mentioned above, the Fund would seek to deepen its \nlearning on the most effective strategies to build communities\u2019 resilience and \npower to claim their rights related to access and management of land and \nnatural resources in West Bengal, as well as on the intersection with \nprotecting indigenous cultural identity.

It was in the year 1995 out \nof felt need by the community members followed by several discussions and \nconsultations, a unique body of the \u2018fallen women\u2019 was formed;  Durbar \nMahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC) came into existence. This is a forum \nexclusively set up and managed by sex workers and their children with the \nobjective of creating solidarity and collective strength among the sex worker \ncommunity and other marginalized groups.\n1. The success of DMSC run HIV intervention program is known as \n\u2018Sonagachi model\u2019 being the most successful intervention among sex \nworkers globally. This has helped National Govt. to articulate a \nstrategy called Targeted Interventions for the high risk communities \nlike sex workers, Transgender, MSM population. Based on the \u2018Lesson \nLearnt\u2019 from Sonagachi Project, NACO (National AIDS Control \nOak Application Form     6\nOrganization) articulated the concept of \u2018Creating Enabling \nEnvironment\u2019 and \u2018Community organizing and Ownership \nbuilding\u2019 what became the budgeted and integral component of HIV \nintervention program. The principles of Sonagachi model was taken to \nbuild the foundation of .Bill and Melinda Gates supported HIV \nintervention program in India spending $350 Million. Both these \nstrategies were also accepted by all UN agencies including big donors \nlike the Global fund DFID etc. in their programmatic approach.\n2. Durbar is a founder member of All India Network of Sex Workers \nwhich at present represent 85 community based organizations of sex \nworkers and TG spread across 18 states in India.\n3. Durbar is part of numbers of National networks and campaign \nmovements like Rights to Food campaign, Rights to education \ncampaign, the Pension Parishad, NREGA Sangharsh Morcha and many \nothers.\n4. We are register member of National Trade Union Initiative [NTUI], a \nnational level trade union in India. The forum  of informal sector \nwomen in the state of  West Bengal which represent voices of around \none hundred thousand women workers belonging to 18 different \noccupational group is jointly headed by a sex workers representative \nfrom Durbar\n5. Durbar is part of many women networks who are fighting against \ngender discrimination, violence against women e.g. Maitreyee, \nSramajibi Swikriti Mancha in West Bengal.\n6. Durbar\u2019s cultural wing has been very successful who are selected to \nperform in the Opening Ceremony of International AIDS Conference \nheld in Geneva as well as they were invited in the last two ICAAPs held \nin Bangkok and Dhaka respectively. The cultural team of Durbar also \ntook part in the \u2018India Got Talent\u2019 program and reached to the finals of \nthe said program.\n7. In the arena of sports, 8 kids from Durbar were selected for various \nage group national level tournaments. Two of them have represented \nthe country and one was selected to take training in Manchester \nUnited, a well-known club from English Premier League. A team from \nDurbar took part in Dana Cup in Denmark which is the biggest \nadolescent group football tournament. They became Group Champions \nin the said tournament. Durbar is also taking part in the ongoing Sub \nJunior and Junior Level I-league.\n8. Durbar is able to prevent the negative amendments of the Immoral \nTraffic (Prevention) Act through a successful protest march to the \nParliament of India in 2006. More than 1000 sex workers were \nparticipated in that protest march.\n9. Conceptualizing and establishing the Self-Regulatory Board which has \nnot only been successful from the strategic point of view but has also \nbeen endorsed by the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court constituted Panel to \nreplicate this model of intervention to curb trafficking in all major \ncities in India.\n10. Usha Multipurpose Co-operative Society, a sister organization of \nDurbar is the example of a sex-workers co-operative which make the \nOak Application Form     7\nsex workers economically empowered At present there are more than \nthirty thousand members of the said co-operative run by the board of \nsex workers which has annual turnover of 25 crores of Rupees. Usha \nwas selected as one of the best models in the co-operative movement in \nWest Bengal in 2016.\n11. In the field of education DURBAR fought a bitter battle to enroll \nchildren of sex workers in formal school. In early days they were \ndenied admission, with a tenuous effort based on advocacy and \nnegotiation we succeeded admission of children, since last three years \non an average one hundred and fifty children per year could complete \nschooling. We also run a hostel for 6these kids which accommodate \neighty children\nThe Right to Food and Work Campaign West Bengal that has been in \nexistence since 2001. In the last seven to eight years with the financial \nassistance from the OAK foundation it has made the following major \ncontributions to the issue of food security: -\n\u2022It has been able to strengthen its network and spreads its network in \n20 districts in the state.\n\u2022In number of cases unpaid wages under the MGNREGA has been paid \nby the government due to strong intervention of the Campaign. In the \nyear 2017 \u2013 18 due to intervention of the campaign about 881 persons \nwere paid their due wages and the approximate amount is \nRs.17919540/-\n\u2022Several times, teams on behalf of the Campaign conducted studies in \nthe tea gardens in North Bengal. Through the studies and fact findings, \nthe campaign prepared a number of reports and calculated dues of the \nworkers from the management. From time to time these reports were \nsubmitted to the both the central and state government as well before \nthe Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court of India. And finally on 4th April, 2018 \nHon\u2019ble Supreme Court in a contempt proceeding of a case filed by \nPaschim Banga Khet Majoor Samity and other unions directed the \ngovernment of West Bengal to pay Rs. 15 Cr. to the workers as an \ninterim relief.\n\u2022The campaign organized  training programs for the tea garden workers \nregarding the procedure of filling claim forms also members of the \ncampaign are consistently monitoring the proper implementation of the \norder passed by Hon\u2019ble Court on 4th April, 2018 and to find out the \nproblems of the workers to fill the forms.\n\u2022The Supreme Court in 2020 constituted a one-member committee \nheaded by retired Supreme Court judge A.M. Sapre to inspect and \nverify the claims of workers. The hearing by Justice Sapre's Committee \nwas delayed due to Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns. However, on \n15.09.2021, the Committee passed an order stating that all the \nworkers of these 29 gardens would have to submit their claim forms \nand which is an ongoing process till date.\n\u2022Fact finding in to the starvation deaths at Bhatpara, North 24 \nParganas, Purulia and Lalgarh, Jhargram have been conducted. This \nhas led to relief programs for the victims and sometimes their \ncommunities. In the recent case of hunger death in the district of \nOak Application Form     8\nJhargram the state government is made accountable and a complaint \nhas been filed to NHRC.\n\u2022Right to Food and Work Campaign have successfully supported a \nseminar of beneficiaries which was a long due plan. In the said seminar \naround 300 delegates from 17 districts of Bengal and 36 other \norganisations came together at Rammohon hall. The objective was to \ninvolve beneficiaries in the campaign to monitor the implementation of \nNFSA, MGNREGA and this seminar is a significant step towards this \nobjective.\n\u2022As per state food security scheme in West Bengal RKSY-I & RKSY-II \n(Rajya Khadya Suraksha Yojana) are the two ration card types under \nwhich wheat and rice is given to poor people through Public \nDistribution System (PDS) / Fair Price Shop (FPS). The RKSY (I & II) \nration cards are issued to the most financially weaker section of the \nstate who are left uncovered under National Food Security Act, 2013 \n(NFSA). Under the state food security scheme, the entitlements as well \nas the subsidized price differs to get dry rations from Public \nDistribution system. The RKSY-I beneficiary gets monthly 5KGs of \nration (3 KGs of Wheat per month at the FPS price of ?2 per KG and \n2KGs of rice per month at the FPS price of ?2 per KG). Whereas, RKSY-\nII ration card beneficiary gets 2 KGs of ration (1 KG of Wheat per \nmonth at the FPS price of ?9 per KG and 1KGs of rice per month at the \nFPS price of ?13 per KG). The entitlement of ration under RKSY-II was \nalready less and was pricier than RKSY-I,the Campaign had advocated \nfor the increase in allocation of the PDS entitlements and to ensure \nequal benefits for RKSY-II card holders. As a result of which, the \ncampaign claims that RKSY-II (Rajya Khadya Suraksha Yojana-II) ration \ncard holders had got 5 kgs of rations per card per month from PDS at \nno cost for the initial phase lockdown, but in the later lockdown \nphases, the original entitlement of 2 KGs of ration per card per month \nwas restored for RKSY-II ration card holders at free of cost. And till \ndate the RKSY-II ration card holders are receiving the ration as per \ntheir entitlement at free of cost throughout the state.\n\u2022The strength of our partner organisations has grown due to adequate \nknowledge of the scheme and laws. As such, they can make the \ngovernment officials function to implement various schemes.\n\u2022During the induced lockdown and post lockdown the campaign has \nconducted two research studies to understand the hunger status and \nthe findings of which has been shared with the state government for \nthe proper implementation of food security in the state.\n\u2022The campaign has able to capacitated more than 40 individuals as \ncommunity leaders identified by the partner organisations.\nCoordination amongst partner organisations has improved and we have \nlearned how to work together.\nOak Application Form     9\n5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? \nHow will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and \ndecide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nRTF&W Campaign WB is addressing the problem of food security, focusing \nespecially on hunger deaths and malnutrition. It is working especially on the \nrights to food and work.  Its work is at various levels. For example, at the \ngrass roots level, it works to ensure that people know about existing rights \nsuch as the Supreme Court orders on Right to Food, the NFSA and the \nMGNREGA. It also understands through the experience at the grass roots \nabout lacunae in the implementation of these rights and mobilises and \ncampaigns to deal with these lacunae at the administrative level. In addition, \nit also defines and lobbies and campaigns for an expansion of these rights at \nthe State and National level. Civil society activists and local leaders are \nactively participating in the movement to add momentum and influence the \npolicy makers to be pro poor in nature. The emergent leaders and the CBOs \nare taking up issues at the micro level and challenging the Panchayat, Block \nand District administration to be accountable and transparent in their \nexecution of these rights.\nThe challenges facing the Campaign are as follows:-\nThe groups, individuals and the community leaders face difficulties related to \npressure from local goons. Besides threats from the local leaders, the \nadministration sometimes creates hindrances in effective implementation. \nRed tapism and too many bottlenecks related to documents and evidential \nproof takes more time in actual initiation of the actions to be taken.\nOrganisations are at various levels of understanding of issues and in \ncapacities to deal with such issues. A big challenge is that there are large \nstretches of blocks and districts where our work has had no impact so far \nand where we do not have any partners.\nA big challenge is to maintain communication and co-ordination amongst \nmember organisations of the campaign. The North-South divide in the state \nin terms of distances as well as issues and even language means that the \nCampaign will have to have parallel activities for different areas.\nSimilarly, another challenge is to convince member organisations to move \nout of the project mode (where food security issues are taken up only when \nthere are funds for a project) to the movement mode where these issues \nbecome part of their work on a long term basis.\nThis in fact would be the main focus of the project i.e. building capacities \nand understanding to go from viewing right to food as only a three year \nproject to a view that it is an essential part of each partner\u2019s work in the long \nterm and that work continues even when the project ends. For this, we will \nfocus on trainings to build capacity, but also give partners practical \nexperience in doing studies, in campaigning and in lobbying. A preclude to \nsuch activity will be to actually do an assessment of where the partner is in \nterms of capacities and understanding of issues.\nOak Application Form     10\nAn important focus is also the use of instruments like litigation, studies and \npublications to bring about public focus on the rights to food and decent \nemployment.\nThe network is learning from its past experiences and incorporating the \nlearnings to the future strategies as and whenever required. For instance, \nthe network is focusing on capacity building of the young generation of the \ntarget communities and building them asset to the communities. Also, \ninclusion of partners and community members in conducting studies helps \nthe network to understand the depth of issue and to collect evidences of \nnegligence/loopholes at the implementation of the social schemes. These \ndocumentations support the campaign to file strong litigation to the court. \nThe network is going to emphasize on capacity building and inclusion of \ncommunities in these processes. The network will also emphasize on modular \ngroup formation as per capacity of the grassroot emerging leaders & existing \npartner organisations and link such groups on the existing groups at village \nlevel, at panchayat level, at Block level, at district level and to state level.", "6.

Despite Government intervention and policies \nover the years, there have been gaps in addressing community needs, leaving \nsome unaddressed and unheard.\nGrassroot organisation\u2019s role hence is fundamental to addressing social needs from \na microscopic lens. Although, India receives the highest foreign aid from across the \nworld, philanthropic efforts are unreachable/inequitably distributed towards the \nrural marginalized sections or urban poverty pockets within cities.\nHence, AFEF\u2019s mission was born out of this realization to support small and mid-\nsized organisations in India who understand the dynamic development dilemmas of \nthe communities, their immediate needs and provide sustainable solutions.

Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nFPA India is currently implementing a 7 year Strategic Plan (2016-2022) focused \non Strengthening Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Services, Advocacy, \nGender, Empowerment, and Young People, and Organizational Efficiency. The \nStrategic Plan envisions all people empowered to enjoy their sexual and \nreproductive health choices and rights in an India free from stigma and \ndiscrimination.\nMission - A voluntary commitment to SRHR to advocate for and enable gender \nequality for all including the poor and vulnerable people, ensure information \neducation and services powered by knowledge, innovation, and technology \ntowards sustainable development.\nFPA India has deployed different models of programming to expand and deepen \nthe service delivery network, deliver and enable comprehensive sexuality \neducation to adolescents, implement inclusive and targeted interventions for the \nSRHR of key populations, address gender disparities and gender-based violence.\nSome of the recommended actions proposed during the mid-term review of the \nstrategic plan conducted in 2019, that have a bearing on the expansion plans \nproposed  under this project:\n1. Enable representation of FPA India in committees formulating block level and \ndistrict level action plans to contribute to the State PIPs, through as many \nBranches of FPA India as possible for creating a synergy between Youth, women \nempowerment, and health service delivery programme of FPA India and the \ncorresponding programmes and schemes implemented by the government bodies \nin those blocks and districts (Such as the RKSK, the RMNCH+A, MHM, AEP) \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\n2. Form consortia for identifying specific priorities (Such as \nAccess/Agency/Entitlements), building consensus, and driving collective action\n3. Focus on economic empowerment of women through entrepreneurial skill-\nbuilding\n4. Enable services through partner clinics \u2013Private and NGO facilities as well as \ngovernment health facilities to expand outreach\nDrivers of the Strategic Plan relevant to this project-\nThe unmet need for family planning and SRH services continues to be high. \nAccording to NFHS 4, the percentage of the Unmet Need for Family Planning \n(currently married women age 15\u201349 years) is found to be 12.9%. Of 37% of \ncontraceptive demand among adolescents (15-19 years) in India, only 15% have \nbeen met leading to 22% of unmet need (NFHS 4). The unmet need for spacing \nmethods is much higher (26%) among adolescents in India compared to the unmet \nneed for limiting (2.5%).[1]\nInequalities-gender & poverty continue to impact health and empowerment \noutcomes; Stigma and discrimination of age, marital status, class, gender, caste, \nsexuality other markers pose major challenges to the implementation of SRHR.\nAvailability of government schemes: a large number of schemes are currently \nbeing implemented by the government for young people, women, and vulnerable \ngroups related to health, livelihood and rights. These pose as opportunities for a \nstrong referral system and partnership building that can enable FPA India and its \nvarious associates including clients to avail the schemes thereby affecting long-\nterm SRHR outcomes.\nWide and varied provider base: There are a large number of registered, formal, \nand non-formal health care providers across the country. Opportunities exist in \npartnerships in integrating SRHR and in task shifting will ensure a wider pool of \nproviders at all levels.\n \n \n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nThe project attempts to address sexual and reproductive health and rights issues \nfaced by individuals and communities due to gender, age, caste, and \nsocioeconomic differentials.\nOur ongoing work in the operational areas of Kalchini and Kolkata has \ndemonstrated an increasing demand for comprehensive abortion care, family \nplanning, cervical cancer screening and management, maternal and child health \nservices, gender-based violence screening and continuum of care for survivors, \ncomprehensive sexuality education for adolescents and for some FGDs with key \nstakeholders conducted in 2017, regarding their perspectives on family planning. \nAdditionally, there is a report of an intervention in the Buxaduar area of \nKalchini that underscores the high need for SRH services for the high-need \nsatellite clinic intervention in Kalchini and Kolkata that needs to be sustained.\nAs per NFHS-4 data for India, the percentage of married women aged 15-49 years \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139\nwho use any modern contraceptive method stands at 47.8%. Of these, women in \nthe age group of 20-24 who were married before the age of 18 stand at 26.8%. \nAlso, women in the age group of 15-19 who were already mothers/pregnant before \n18 years is significantly high in the state of West Bengal (16.4%).\nData also shows that adolescents and youth have limited awareness about sexual \nand reproductive health matters. For instance, only 15% of young men and women \n(15\u201324 years) reported receiving any family life or sex education.\nHome to nearly 18% of the world\u2019s population, India also has the largest number \nof people living below the international poverty line of USD 1.90 a day. The socio-\neconomic disparities in India increased further during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nAround 140,000,000 (14 crores) Indians lost employment during the lockdown. \nMore than 45% of households across the nation reported an income drop as \ncompared to the previous year.\nSituated near Indo-Bhutan International Border, most people from the operational \narea of Kalchini are dependent on Tea Gardens. These tea garden workers are \ndeprived of their daily wages as per the government protocol. The health-seeking \nbehaviour among the Tea Garden workers is also found to be very low due to the \nlack of easily accessible health facilities in the villages of remote and forest areas.\n \nThe tea estates are located deep in the interiors with no Government or private \nhealth facilities available nearby. There is a lack of good means of transport and \nthe roads leading up to the tea estates/gardens are in a bad condition. This makes \nit even more difficult for healthcare professionals to get there to render health \nservices to the workers and families. An assessment of the needs of the tea garden \ncommunity during an intervention led by FPA India in Darjeeling district showed a \nhigh need for SRH and general health services. \nThe findings suggested a need for an integrated SRHR intervention for the health \nand well-being of tea garden workers and high demand from the community for \ncontinuation of the intervention, as they experience improved access to health \ncare and an improvement in their health-seeking behaviour.\nThe second wave of covid-19 has further exposed the potholes in the healthcare \nsystems. Given the restrictions on movement during the lockdown, people\u2019s ability \nto access health care services was severely impacted. Sexual and Reproductive \nhealthcare services, including maternal and child healthcare, safe abortion \nservices & Gender-based violence services were among the most severely \nimpacted, with the lack of access to ante-natal care & GBV care leading to a rise in \npreventable deaths. A surge in gender-based violence cases particularly domestic \nviolence showed the gendered nature of the pandemic and the need for sustained \nintervention.\n \nThe COVID - 19 pandemic has given an opportunity to FPA India to expand the \nservice coverage in Kalchni and Kolkata by engaging government and private \nplayers to utilize and explore the digital health solutions into practice & build \ninfrastructure capacities to facilitate telemedicine & teleconsultation models to \naddress the SRH needs of communities, without fragmenting the existing \nlandscapes of service delivery of care.\n \nFPA India Kalchini Branch covers a population of more than 10 lakhs across \nKalchini and Madarihaat blocks and Madarihaat municipality. Besides serving a \nlarge population of tea garden workers and their families, the branch reaches out \nto the most vulnerable and marginalized groups that include female sex workers at \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201310\nJaigaon (Indo Bhutan Border) and Alipurduar, Persons Living with HIV AIDs \n(PLWHA) in Alipurduar. The Branch is also associated with 380 CBOs, SHGs and \nyouth groups that can be mobilized for community-based interventions. In recent \nmonths, the Branch has also started conducting Rapid Antigen tests for COVID-19 \nfor all clients with symptoms/history of exposure who visit the clinic for non-\nCOVID essential SRH services. The local district authorities rely on the FPAI team \nin Kalchini to deliver last-mile contraceptive supplies and immunization services to \nneedy populations in hilly terrains where there are no motorable roads or \ngovernment health facilities.\n \nFPA India Kolkata Branch covers (Urban, peri-urban, rural and slum-based \npopulations of more than 18 lakh, in Howrah, Hooghly, and North & South 24 \nParaganas. The Branch has initiated interventions in the high need areas of \nCanning, Kultoli, Shason, Bhangor, Shamnagar, Icchapur, Champdani, \nShreerampur, Watgunge, Tollygunge, Raidighi, Songachi, Sheoraphuli, reaching \nout to the most vulnerable communities including female Sex workers, \ntransgenders, men having sex with men (MSMs), Injecting Drug Users, migrants \nand the elderly. A network of 47 Self Help Groups, 60 Youth Groups and 6 CBOs \nwork closely with the Branch, to enable community-based interventions.\n \nThus FPAI has been continually responsive to the community needs as well as the \nrequests from health authorities to bridge the gaps in the SRH services, leading to \nan organic evolution of the programme from a family planning intervention in the \nearly years to a more comprehensive SRH programme.\nWith support from Oak, FPA India will be able to conduct capacity building and \nadvocacy interventions to energize the public health system and build community \nnetworks of vulnerable groups for sustained demand generation. Thus, the \nintervention will bring about a transformational change in the community, from \nbeing \u2018beneficiaries\u2019 of the programmes to stakeholders in the process of \ndevelopment. FPAI will also invest in partnerships such as with Ipas, to make \ninroads into newer geographies, for example, in the Sundarbans\nFPAI will expand focused SRH work in the high need Sundarbans areas through \nthe FPAI Kolkata branch, specifically in Kultali, Hingalganj, Canning, Gadkhali, \nBasanti and Gosaba in south 24 parganas.

The lack of an ecosystem for promotion of Distributed renewable energy \nsolutions and the significance of awareness & capacity building of key \nstakeholders to address resource depletion and environmental \nchallenges.\n2. The importance of engaging grassroots civil society organizations which \nleads to amplification of the impact and reach of initiatives.\n3. Adoption of the nexus approach between energy, water, and agriculture \nyields multidimensional benefits for both the environment and rural \ncommunities.\n4. Women as key stakeholders in natural resource management empowers \nthem and leads to robust and sustainable outcomes.\n5. Building strategic partnerships with state nodal agencies, banks, and \nfinancial institutions leads to efficient project implementation and \nfacilitates better access to financing & resources.\n6. Capacity building through training programs and knowledge \ndissemination strengthens the skills and expertise of stakeholders, \nparticularly youth and rural women.\n7. Leveraging digital platforms, such as Learning Management Systems, \ncreates active knowledge banks and expands the reach of educational \nresources to the communities at large..\n8. Promoting collective action and formalizing networks fosters \ncollaboration and resource sharing among organizations working \ntowards similar goals.\nOak Application Form     16\n9. Implementing climate-resilient agricultural practices and fostering \ninnovations improves adaptation and resilience of disadvantaged \ncommunities in the face of climate change.\nDrawing from these learnings, ecosystem approach has been a by-default \naspect of any project involving rural communities. Also, in our recent program \nregarding monitoring of groundwater and its recharge through watershed \nplanning, rural women have been central players right from periodic \ngroundwater monitoring. These successful approaches will guide the current \nproject in achieving its objectives and maximizing its impact on just energy \ntransition and sustainable resource management.\n3.If cap-ex for technology products is to be sourced from schemes, why \nis the budget component so high? There has to be a clear rationale on \nthe budget.\nThis is primarily due to the lack of an existing ecosystem that should \nencompass interlinkages between Technology, Scheme, Finance, Production \nChain, and Market, which would be crucial for ensuring effective energy \naccess and livelihood enhancement for the small tea growers and tea garden \nworkers..\nTo establish this essential ecosystem, it is necessary to engage a group of \nprofessionals who possess the expertise and experience in bridging the gaps \nbetween various stakeholders. These professionals will play a vital role in \nidentifying suitable technology solutions, coordinating with relevant schemes \nfor capital expenditure, establishing financial mechanisms, facilitating \nproduction chain integration, and creating market linkages. Cost covered for \ntraining and capacity building is a little less than half of the proposed grant. \nAlso, extensive research during the first 6 months of the project and \ndemonstration of DRE applications during the first two years of the project will \nrequire significant program expenditure.\nWe believe that investing in the establishment of this ecosystem is essential to \novercome the existing barriers and challenges faced by the these communities. \nBy doing so, we can create a solid foundation for future projects, streamline \nthe implementation of renewable technologies, and effectively leverage \navailable schemes for capital expenditure on technology products.\nThe estimated budget for the proposed project is USD 160 per beneficiary \nfamily. Out of this USD 107 per family is being sought from OAK Foundation. \nOut of this, an estimated cost for the whole package of training would be USD \n42 per family during the tenure of the project. The cost for all 6 researches \nwould be USD 6 per family. Developing ecosystem (Stakeholder meeting, \nbuyer-seller meet, producer expo) would cost USD 11 per family. Maintaining \nMIS throughout the project period would cost USD 4 per family. A team of 9 \nfull-time staffs (Capacity Building Manager, Communication Manager, \nLivelihood Expert, Energy Expert and 5 Tea-Garden Coordinators) would be \ninvolved right from inception till the completion of the project for handholding \nsupport to community throughout the journey. Individuals in this team will be \npaid a monthly average salary of USD 455 (Range of USD 377-566). Total cost \nto this team would be  USD 39 per family throughout the project period.\n4.What are the possibilities of enhancing the committed co-financing \nfrom the present USD 50,000?\nOak Application Form     17\nCurrently, we have secured a core grant of USD 50,000 from MacArthur \nFoundation. These commitments have been instrumental in enabling us to \ninitiate the project and lay the foundation for its success.\nAfter careful consideration and exploring potential avenues, we have identified \nthe possibility of enhancing the committed co-financing up to a maximum of \nUSD 84,000.\n5.The solar cookstoves model has not been so successful till date. What \nare the strategies to be adopted towards mitigating this risk. What \nlearnings can you factor in from other models implemented elsewhere. \nPlease undertake a secondary research on the same.\nIn Guatemala, the Solar Household Energy project effectively increased the \nadoption of solar cookstoves by providing tailored training, addressing cultural \npreferences, and ensuring affordability (Source: https://www.she-inc.org/). \nSimilarly, in India, the Solar Cooking Project successfully promoted solar \ncookstoves by involving local communities in the design and promotion \nprocess, emphasizing health and environmental benefits, and facilitating \naccess to finance (Source: https://www.solarcookers.org/work). For instance, \nBarli Institute has been successfully experimenting with solar cookers for over \n22 years in Madhya Pradesh.  Since 1998 the Institute has developed its \nkitchen tailored to solar cooking, and has installed 3 large Scheffler parabolic \ncookers in this kitchen. It has an ongoing program on \u201csolar cooking and food \nprocessing\u201d where the institute prepares all its meals for 130 persons per day \nwith solar cookers (for about 300 solar days a year), saving up to 12 cylinders \nof cooking gas (equivalent to about 900 kilograms of wood) each month. This \nprogram helps women to escape the daily, back-breaking work of fuel \ngathering, and preserve forest and woodlands and reduce air pollution. The \ninstitute provides training in maintenance of SK-14 & Prince-15 parabolic \ndomestic solar cookers. The ex-trainees also introduce and demonstrate the \nbenefits of solar cooking to their neighboring communities.\n(https://www.barli.org/english-brochure.html)\nApplied Science and Engineering was founded by Dr. Srinivasa Ravuri from \nSecunderabad in Telangana. Srinivasa created this organization to pursue \nresearch, design, and promotion of solar-thermal implements that can be used \nfor cooking, heating, food drying, and for water desalination. The organization \nhas been involved with solar cooking since 2008. By 2016 they had distributed \n50 solar cookers and had taught over 200 people to solar cook with solar box \ncookers, parabolic cookers, and solar food dryers.\n(https://solarcooking.fandom.com/wiki/Applied_Science_and_Engineering)\nWe don\u2019t have a mandated agenda to promote Solar Cooker in the intervention \narea. The approach would be to first test the technical feasibility of Solar \nCooker in the region. Upon successful trial, we can set up pilot projects and \ndemonstration centers in collaboration with local partners and organizations. \nThis can include community meetings, demonstrations, and interactive \nsessions to address any misconceptions or skepticism. These initiatives can \nshowcase the effectiveness of solar cookers, allowing community members to \nsee the benefits firsthand and gain confidence in the technology. Our recent \nfact finding visit in Kalimpong shows that more and more households in the \ntea-garden communities are getting LPG gas connection and reducing \ndependence on firewood. However, considering the costs involved in LPG gas \nOak Application Form     18\nconnection, sharing the burden with Solar cook-stove in a hybrid mode would \nsurely prove to be a cost-cutting model.\n6.There should be a clear market study/scoping study on available \ntechnological equipment (supply chain, maintenance, costs) and a \nstudy of the green jobs and entrepreneurship potential in the region. \nThis should inform the training interventions for the youth and identify \nthe sectors, businesses (locally and regionally) for placement of these \nyouth. What are the types of entrepreneurship avenues possible related \nto renewables in the region?\nThe market and scoping study will comprehensively analyze the existing \ntechnological equipment relevant to renewable energy solutions, including \ntheir supply chain, maintenance requirements, and costs. Additionally, the \nstudy will assess the green jobs and entrepreneurship potential in the region, \nidentifying sectors and businesses suitable for youth placement. It will also \nexplore various entrepreneurship avenues related to renewables. The study \nwill gather data through surveys, interviews, and field visits, assessing market \ndemand, local needs, and potential for sustainable businesses. Findings will \ninform targeted training interventions for youth and guide the development of \na robust ecosystem for renewable energy adoption and entrepreneurship in \nthe region. A few important aspects to be covered are as follows -\nTechnology Assessment: The study will assess the availability, suitability, and \ncost-effectiveness of renewable energy technologies in the market. This \nincludes solar cook stoves, solar pumps, and other DRE appliances.\nGreen Jobs and Entrepreneurship Potential: It will identify potential sectors \nwith growth opportunities for green jobs and entrepreneurship, considering \nthe region's ecological and socio-economic context.\nTraining Needs Analysis: The study will analyze the skill gaps and training \nrequirements for youth to actively engage in the renewable energy sector and \ngreen job opportunities.\nLocal and Regional Business Identification: It will identify and assess local and \nregional businesses that align with renewable energy solutions and green \npractices, offering placement opportunities for trained youth.\nPolicy and Regulatory Analysis: The study will analyze existing policies and \nregulations related to renewable energy and identify opportunities and \nchallenges for entrepreneurship.\nThe study's outcomes will be instrumental in guiding the project's \ninterventions and ensuring that youth are equipped with the necessary skills \nand knowledge to thrive in the growing renewable energy market while \nfostering entrepreneurship and sustainable practices in the region.\n7.SwitchON should consider narrowing down of the programme just \nfocusing on meeting the energy needs (electricity, water, cooking fuel, \nlighting). The strategy for broadening the set of interventions should \nbe well thought of and selective (youth training and employment, \nentrepreneurship, alternative livelihoods).\nWhile we understand the importance of selectivity and a well-thought-out \nstrategy, we also recognize the need for a comprehensive approach to address \nthe multifaceted challenges faced by the small tea growers and tea garden \nworkers. By providing a basket of decentralized renewable energy (DRE) \nOak Application Form     19\nsolutions, there is opportunity to address the immediate energy needs of the \ntarget community while also promoting alternative livelihood opportunities. \nBased on the terrain of tea-garden and availability of land, a few \nenvironmentally compatible value chain options could be Eco-tourism and \nHospitality (homestays, cultural experiences), Small scale organic farming \n(Spices, Herbs etc.), Beekeeping and Honey Production, Dairy and Livestock \nFarming, Making of Sal-Leaf plates, Mushroom Cultivation, Horticulture (fruit-\nbearing trees, mushroom, medicinal plants, herbal plants). However, choosing \nthe combination of suitable livelihood would depend on a number of factors \nincluding availability of spare land, access to forest, marketability etc. \nWe acknowledge the importance of thoughtful selection and prioritization of \ninterventions based on local context, market demand, and community needs. \nOur team will conduct thorough assessments and engage in dialogue with the \ncommunities in 3 tea gardens and small tea growers across in Jalpaiguri, \nKalimpong and Darjeeling districts to identify the most relevant and impactful \ninterventions. While the central focus would be to help 2500 small tea growers \nand tea garden workers (3 tea gardens) meet the energy needs, the resources \nwill also be invested in making the community aware of the scopes and \npossibilities around alternate sustainable livelihood option in an ecosystem \napproach to enhance their resilience to future challenges. Also among targeted \n5000 families (including both tea garden workers and small tea growers), there \nwould always be a few risk-takers who would come forward to learn and adapt \nnew livelihood avenues in small scale with assured market. Their success will \nbe the living demonstrations to boost the courage of a few others to come \nforward.\nA recent feasibility study conducted in northeast India's tea estates, a major \ntea-growing region, found a significant opportunity for adopting renewable \nenergy systems. The study surveyed eight tea gardens (four from Assam and \nfour from West Bengal) and seven tea processing industries. It revealed that \ntea gardens believe that installing large solar panels would not affect tea plant \ngrowth. Solar energy was preferred over other alternatives due to lower costs \nand easier installation. Most tea gardens (87.5%) have unused or barren land \nsuitable for solar panel installation, while a few (12.5%) do not.\n(https://krishi.icar.gov.in/jspui/bitstream/123456789/71187/1/Feasibilitystudy\nonrenewableenergysysteminteaCamelliasinensis.pdf)\n(https://india.mongabay.com/2022/02/assam-tea-gardens-experiment-with-\nsolar-for-reliable-power-supply-and-cutting-costs-emissions/)\n8.What about the geography? Kalimpong exclusively or layering on \nother tea gardens across the tea garden region.\nEnvironment Conservation Society has no pressing agenda of sticking to \nKalimpong as project area. Strategically, it would rather be fruitful to extend \nthis project to areas with prior presence of Oak Foundation and it\u2019s partners. \nIt is assumed that the prior rapport with communities in such area would \nensure an initial thrust during the inception of the project. However, alongside \nKalimpong, we\u2019re targeting Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling to bring under the \npurview of the project. .\n9.Rationale behind initial 6 months of research\nThe project shall be undertaking 4 initial researches within the first 6 months. \nThey include Baseline Study on Program Indicators, Need Assessment on \nOak Application Form     20\nEnergy Requirements in Tea Garden, Scoping study on the potential of \nlivelihood enhancement of small tea growers as well as diversified livelihood \noptions for tea garden workers, and Market study to identify appropriate \ntechnology solutions. Each of these studies (except the last one) would involve \nsurvey with around 1000 Households. We are allotting 45 days (effective 37 \nworking days) for each of these studies. This would involve finalizing research \nmethodology, research tools, training of enumerators, data tabulation, data \ncleaning, data analysis, draft report, internal peer review and final report. We \nwould insist that same group of researcher would be conducting all four \nresearches to ensure interconnectivity in research findings and same standard \nin all four knowledge products. Thus, research would be conducted one after \nanother and would require 6 months.\n10.What are the possible DRE technologies that can be adopted in this \nproject\nSolar Power Systems: Installation of solar panels for generating electricity and \nmeeting energy needs in tea gardens and associated facilities.\nBiogas Systems: Implementation of biogas plants to convert organic waste \nfrom tea gardens and livestock farming into biogas for cooking and heating \npurposes.\nImproved Cookstoves: Introducing energy-efficient cookstoves to reduce fuel \nconsumption and indoor air pollution.\nSolar Water Heaters: Deploying solar water heating systems to provide hot \nwater for various needs, such as bathing and kitchen use.\nSolar Dryers: Utilizing solar energy to power drying systems for tea leaves, \nspices, and herbs, enhancing the efficiency and quality of the drying process.\nSolar Water Pumps: Installing solar-powered water pumps for drinking/small \nirrigation purposes, reducing reliance on grid electricity or diesel pumps.\nSolar Power Sprayers: This Is to support the existing agro-technical need of \nthe small tea growers.\nEnergy-Efficient Lighting: Promoting the use of energy-efficient LED lighting \nsystems in tea garden households and community spaces.\nPart B: \n1.Which are the financing schemes (central/state) that can be \nharnessed for this proposed project and what are the modalities for \ndoing so? Since this is the tea garden community with the only identity \nof being \u201clabourers\u201d, their eligibility for these schemes should be \nconsidered carefully.\nApplicable for Small Tea Growers -\nMajor Central Schemes/Agencies - Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), \nSwarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY), Tea Development & Promotion \nScheme, Tea Board of India.\nMajor State Schemes/Agencies - Financial Support Scheme for Farm \nMechanization (FSSM), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchay Yojna (PMKSY), \nMIssion For Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), West Bengal \nState Rural Livelihoods Mission (WBSRLM)-Anandadhara, Bangla Swanirbhar \nKarmasansthan Prakalpa (BSKP), West Bengal Swanirbhar Sahayak Prakalpa, \nKarmo Bhumi Prakalpa, Yuvashree Arpan Scheme\nOak Application Form     21\nApplicable for Tea Garden Workers -\nMajor Central Schemes/Agencies - Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), \nSwarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY), Tea Development & Promotion \nScheme\nMajor State Schemes/Agencies - West Bengal Swanirbhar Sahayak Prakalpa, \nKarmo Bhumi Prakalpa, Yuvashree Arpan Scheme, Chaai Sundari Scheme. \nSamajik Surakshya Yojana \nTo harness the mentioned financial schemes, the modalities can include \nidentifying eligible beneficiaries, conducting training programs, facilitating \nloan applications, collaborating with relevant government departments, and \nproviding guidance on accessing the benefits.\n2.How the proposed programme can be positioned for generating \ntraction with the administration and philanthropic sector as a pathway \nfor improved living conditions, economic opportunities and climate \nadaptation? What are the opportunities?\nThe proposed programme can be positioned as a comprehensive solution with \nfollowing opportunities -\n\u2022Highlighting the alignment of the programme with government priorities \nand policies related to poverty alleviation, rural development, and \nclimate change mitigation. A few such policies are mentioned below-\n1.Policy Framework for developing and promoting Decentralized \nRenewable Energy (DRE) Livelihood Applications in Rural Areas\n2.Policy on Co-generation and Generation of Electricity from Renewable \nSources of Energy.\n3.State Climate Change Action Plan (SCCAP)\n4.West Bengal Startup Policy\n\u2022Demonstrating the potential for positive socio-economic impacts through \ncase studies, success stories, and data on livelihood improvements, \nincome generation, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.\n\u2022Engaging with relevant government departments, local authorities, and \nphilanthropic organizations through presentations, workshops, and \nstakeholder consultations to build partnerships and garner support.\n\u2022Showcasing the programme's potential for scalability and replication, \nemphasizing the long-term benefits and sustainability of the proposed \ninterventions.\n3.Secondary information on the green jobs sector in West Bengal and \nelsewhere in India? Are there any strategic tie-ups with companies \nwhich produce these clean energy solutions for placement of youth?\nThe renewable energy sector in India has witnessed significant growth, driven \nby government policies and initiatives like the National Solar Mission. Solar \npower has emerged as a major contributor to green job creation, with \nopportunities in solar panel manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. \nAlso, National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is being implemented in seven \nnon-attainment cities in West Bengal. NCAP 2.0 is likely to create between \n20,000 and 40,000 green jobs in West Bengal alone, opined experts at the India \nClean Air Summit 2022 (ICAS 2022). As per a senior professor of IIT Kanpur, \nOak Application Form     22\nan estimated 1 million green jobs are available within the air quality domain \nalone across India. Overall, India has the potential to create 35 million green \njobs by the year 2047 in renewable energy, waste management, electric \nvehicles, green construction, and sustainable textiles in urban and peri-urban \nareas, according to a study launched by Skill Council for Green Jobs and Sattva \nConsulting and supported by J.P. Morgan\n(https://www.millenniumpost.in/kolkata/bengal-to-create-20k-to-40k-green-\njobs-in-next-few-years-490996?infinitescroll=1)\n(http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/100318337.cms?from=mdr&\nutm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst)\nOn the other hand, The central government's focus on electric mobility has led \nto the emergence of green jobs in electric vehicle manufacturing, charging \ninfrastructure development, and battery technology. Government initiatives \nlike the Skill India Mission and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy's \nskill development programs aim to bridge the skill gap and create a pool of \ntrained professionals for the green sector. Additionally, programs like the \nGreen Skill Development Programme (GSDP) provide training and certification \nin specific green job roles. According to available data, entry-level technicians \nin renewable energy sectors can earn an average salary ranging from INR \n15,000 to INR 30,000 per month. With experience and specialization, the \nsalary range can increase. The government's commitment to renewable energy \nand sustainable development, coupled with global efforts to combat climate \nchange, will continue to drive demand for skilled workers in green industries. \nMission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) is an indicator towards the same.\nIndia\u2019s solar and wind energy sectors employed 1,64,000 workers as of FY\u201922, \nshowing a 47% increase from FY\u201921. 84% of this workforce is in the solar \nenergy sector.. Solar energy alone accounted for the largest share of green \njobs in India, employing over 120,000 people in various roles such as \nmanufacturing, installation, and maintenance. By 2030, it is projected that the \nEV sector in India will create around 10 million jobs across the value chain, \nincluding manufacturing, assembly, battery production, and charging \ninfrastructure.\nAs per a very recent \u201cBusiness Standard\u201d article this month, a study conducted \nby NLB Services claim that demand for green jobs in India is projected to grow \nat a rate of 15-20% annually over the next decade. This growth trajectory \nsuggests that India has the potential to create 30-32 million green jobs by \n2050. The increasing demand for green jobs is primarily motivated by India's \nambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070.

(300 words)\nOak Application Form     6\nSince BAT\u2019s inception, we have pioneered a disruptive and non-traditional \napproach to development. Inspired by our sector leading social finance \ninitiatives, all our programmes are focused on and driven by outcomes, \nwhich ensures that we deliver results at pace for the most underserved \ncommunities across South Asia. Through our child protection programme in \nIndia, BAT has successfully brought together the public, private and \nvoluntary sectors to trial community-led, sustainable solutions, which have \nsupported 486,000 vulnerable children and young women in 2021-2022. \nSome of our key achievements in this area include:\n\u2022BAT was one of the key partners at the heart of the Child Labour Free \nJaipur coalition to address the prevalence of child labour. As result of \nour efforts, there was greater enforcement of child labour laws, which \nled to a 70% increase in the number of children rescued from child \nlabour, and 15 convictions over four years \u2013 an unprecedented \nachievement, and a significant deterrent for traffickers.\n\u2022Our Prevention Model implemented in West Bengal has demonstrated \nimpact in mitigating trafficking. We observed increased participation \nof young people and families - 4,000 young people in collectives, 1,091 \nactive Community-based Institutions (CBIs); improved capacity among \nCBIs to support vulnerable children - 43% of child protection cases and \n73% of at-risk cases of trafficking were resolved by CBIs; and improved \nliving conditions through access to entitlements - 82% of beneficiaries \npeople who applied for job cards saw an increase in monthly income.\n\u2022Through our work with the Jharkhand Anti-Trafficking Network, a \ncoalition of 13 organisations, we have reached out to over 20,000 \ncommunity members to promote safe migration and prevent \ntrafficking.\nWe have also recently launched a strategic partnership with the Children\u2019s \nInvestment Fund Foundation to develop an ambitious Child Protection \nProgramme, which will leverage significant support to strengthen the child \nprotection ecosystem in India and reduce exploitation of children by 30%.\n5c.

(600 words):\nEvidence suggests that the tea garden districts of northern West Bengal are \nlikely source and transit points along the migration and trafficking corridor. \nAlipurduar, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling districts in particular, share porous \nborders with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh, and with north-east India, \nmaking them likely hubs for trafficking and unsafe migration.\nThere are nearly 250 tea gardens across the three districts employing over 2.2 \nlakh workers, around 10% of which have been declared sick or shut down. Tea \ngarden workers have been systemically exploited, often denied the minimum \nOak Application Form     7\nwage or entitlements such as provident fund and gratuity. Debt is offered in \nadvance and offset against wages, trapping them in a vicious cycle. Child \nlabour is rampant with many children being employed at 50% of the minimum \nwage for adults in peak season. Poverty, illiteracy, school dropouts, \nunemployment, under-employment, exploitation of workers (low wages, \nunpaid wages and benefits) are issues that are commonly seen. Poor \nimplementation of social protection schemes further marginalises and \ndisenfranchises them. As a result, the region witnesses high rates of out-\nmigration, including that of young people to faraway destinations without the \nknowledge or support of their families, making them vulnerable to trafficking \nand exploitation. Between 1992 and 2015, over 2.5 lakh people migrated out \nof tea gardens.\nWithin the state, 21.43% of the population is multi-dimensionally poor. The \nCOVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the crisis, with many families \ndeprioritising health, nutrition, and education. The Annual State of \nEducation Report for West Bengal 2021 estimates that 3.5% of children aged \n15 to 16 years have either dropped out of school or never been enrolled. The \nNational Family Health Survey V also paints a sordid picture on the health \nand nutritional indicators for children, and points to a prevalence of early \nmarriage and gender-based violence. From 2016-2020, 8,000 children were \nreported missing from the state every year, and children account for 75% of \ncases of victims trafficked and victims rescued in 2020. CHILDLINE data \nalso points to a high number of trafficking cases \u2013 23% of cases in 2019-20 \nwere reported from West Bengal. Due to the recent division of districts, child \nprotection structures such as Child Welfare Committees, Anti-Human \nTrafficking Units, shelter homes etc. are inadequate. Grassroots structures \nsuch as Village-level Child Protection Committees are inactive as well. With \ntea gardens being privately managed and far from the district headquarters, \nit is also challenging for stakeholders to make inroads with the community \nfor monitoring and vigilance. \nBAT in partnership with The Hummingbird Foundation has developed a \nPrevention of Trafficking Model that has demonstrated impact in mitigating \ntrafficking in West Bengal. The premise is that collective action by key \nstakeholders\u2013young people, parents, community-based institutions and local \ngovernment\u2013leads to transformative community action and ultimately \n'systems change\u2019 to reduce the risk of trafficking. We believe that this model, \nwith certain adaptations, can also serve to reduce the vulnerabilities that \nlead to unsafe migration.\nWe seek to roll out an integrated programme in Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and \nDarjeeling districts (selected after gathering secondary data and inputs from \norganisations, researchers and government stakeholders working in the \nregion), that draws together children (6 to 18 years), young people (18 to 24 \nyears), families, community-based institutions such as Self Help Groups, \nchildren and youth groups, School Management Communities, Tea Garden \nAssociations, migrant workers and state actors; builds their capacity to take \ncollective action; and bridges the gaps in convergence between stakeholders. \nWe will engage with 3 lakh community members, including 1.2 lakh children \nacross 8 blocks in 3 districts, and will leverage on their local knowledge and \nstrengths to design interventions that are best suited to the local context. We \nwill convene a safe migration and counter trafficking network of \nimplementing partners and resource organisations who hold strong \nOak Application Form     8\ncommunity linkages and knowledge at different levels (panchayat, block and \ndistrict), collaboratively working towards a common goal of mitigating \ntrafficking and unsafe migration. Key interventions that are planned include \ncommunity mobilisation; awareness generation; collectivisation and \nstrengthening of grassroots child protection structures; empowerment of \nchildren and young people; facilitating linkages to entitlements; vocational \ntraining; and capacity building, engagement and advocacy with ecosystem \nstakeholders and government systems.  \nThe recent notifications issued by the Ministry of Women and Child \nDevelopment on the Mission Vatsalya Implementation Guidelines, and by the \nWest Bengal Government on the Modified Guidelines for Child Protection \nCommittees in West Bengal, also serve as proof that the conditions are \nfavourable to work with grassroots structures. Additionally, one of the \nselected implementing partners, CINI, has been appointed by the West \nBengal government as one of the nodal agencies responsible for \nimplementing the modified guidelines.", "6.

COOPERATION": "8. COOPERATION  \nHow will you involve others in your approach to achieving change? If you are \nplanning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived \nexperience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  \nWhy are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are \nchoosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you \nusually work? (300 words):\nBAT will bring together a coalition of organisations comprising Child In Need \nInstitute, Child Rights and You, FXB Suraksha and Nirmana, to build a \ncollaborative model that will address vulnerabilities and gaps in service \ndelivery at various points along the source-transit-destination corridor, with a \ncommon goal to prevent trafficking and other child rights violations and \npromote safe migration. The implementing partners have been selected based \non their track record of working on issues on child protection and safe \nmigration in the region, at different levels of governance (panchayat, block \nand district). Our selected partners have extensive expertise across a broad \nrange of issues, including social protection, livelihoods and behaviour change, \nwhich will add value to the project. BAT will regularly convene our \nimplementing partners and government stakeholders, to facilitate knowledge \nexchange and ensure that inputs from the grassroots are fed upwards to policy \nmakers.\nBAT is committed to a bottom-up approach to all our programmes, to ensure \nthat communities we serve have a voice in programme design. BAT\u2019s partners \nwill meet with communities on a regular basis, so that we can receive feedback \nand alter our approach as needed. We will establish a community-led safety \nnet and build capacities of children and communities to empower them to take \nownership of issues that affect them and hold state actors accountable, so that \nbeneficiaries receive their entitlements.\nGiven BAT\u2019s partnership with the Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation \n(CIFF), a grant from the Oak Foundation is likely to be matched 1:1 by CIFF. \nThe matched funding will allow BAT to layer on complementary interventions \nthat will add significant depth and scale to the activities supported by the \nOak Foundation, thus achieving greater impact.", "9.

We will \nalso distribute monies to partners every six months to mitigate any impact \nfrom regulatory risk.\nPolitical environment: General elections are scheduled for 2024, and this \nmay impact our work with government systems in the second year of the \nprogramme. Restrictions on gatherings during elections are also likely to \nhave an impact on our work with groups and collectives. We will pivot our \ninterventions based on the political context. \nConvergence between a consortium of groups with diverse ideologies: \nBAT will organise a series of strategy and network-building activities and \nworkshops for partner organisations, which will allow them to work toward a \ncommon goal set collaboratively by everyone.\nOpposition from tea garden associations: BAT\u2019s implementing partners \nhave had previous experience of working with tea garden associations and \nwill be able to facilitate meaningful dialogue and solicit cooperation from \nthese associations.\nSafeguarding:  To mitigate against any safeguarding risks, BAT will train all \nour partners using BAT\u2019s robust safeguarding policy. This will include \nensuring communities and project participants are aware of communication \nmechanisms to highlight an issue and procedures are in place to effectively \nrespond.\nOpportunities:\nPartnership with CIFF: BAT has partnered with CIFF to develop a \npioneering new Child Protection Programme, with the aim of reducing \nexploitation of children in seven high prevalence states. Through trialling \ninnovative solutions, scaling-up tested models and sharing best practice with \nkey stakeholders, this partnership will contribute to creating a more robust \nand collaborative child protection eco-system across India.\nStrong connect with the West Bengal Government:  BAT has a good \nrelationship with West Bengal's Ministry of Women and Child Development, \nwhich we will leverage to help implement the programme and scale-it up to \nother areas in the state.", "11.

AIF does this through high-impact \ninterventions in education, health, livelihoods, and leadership because \npoverty is multidimensional. In 2015, we introduced gender justice and \nenvironmental sustainability as two cross-cutting themes in our program \nframework.

Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nThe Problem: AIF along with BBC partners intends to address the problem \nof Low Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) in Rural India: \nAt a policy level, Ministries such as Women and Child Development have \nschemes like E-Haat, Rashtriya Mahila Kosh and Swayam Siddha Kosh project \namong others made a sincere effort to encourage women entrepreneurship. \nHowever, despite the positive conversations and concrete steps being taken \naround the issue, it has unfortunately not translated into a conducive \nentrepreneurship ecosystem for women. There are a multitude of barriers \nthat are a hindrance to the social progress of women as entrepreneurs. These \ninclude but are not limited to the inherent bias against women\u2019s business \nskills, conventional gender roles rooted in patriarchal mindsets, and lack of \naccess to finance and networks, among others. Refer detailed research report \nin the attachment. Deeply embedded gender norms among other sociocultural \nissues deprive women of access to information, market knowledge, finance, \nand most importantly, paid employment.\nAccording to a 2019 report by Google and Bain & Company, women were \nalready worst hit by India\u2019s unemployment crisis. While the overall Indian \nunemployment rate was at 7 percent before India\u2019s March 2020 lockdown, it \nwas already as high as 18 percent for women. Post the devastating impact of \nthe COVID 19 on India\u2019s economy and the widening job crises, the FLFPR of \nIndia dropped to a historic low of 16.1% during the July-September 2020 \nquarter, the lowest among the major economies. In 2021, as the COVID \npandemic hit jobs and the economy, less than 16.1% of Indian women were \npart of the country\u2019s labour force (Reuters, 2021). This is among the lowest \nrates of women\u2019s workforce participation in the world. Today, only Yemen, \nIraq, Jordan, Syria, Algeria, Iran, and the West Bank and Gaza have lower \nFLFPR than India.\nRationale for Formative Phase: BBC partners entered into the formative \nphase with a hypothesis that the micro, small, medium enterprise (MSME) \nOak Application Form     8\nsector can play a significant role in accelerating rural women's \nentrepreneurship, such that they can leverage digital and climate-resilient \ntechnologies, access government schemes and provisions and lead inclusive \nvalue chains to demonstrate an increase in FLFPR. To do so, BBC partners\u2019 \nmain objective were to learn following broader aspects to design gender-\nsensitive programs via addressing following informational gaps:\n\u2022Identification of key enabling factors for the ecosystem to address \nsystemic challenges, BBC partners will identify opportunities through \nresearch findings and strengthen networks for accelerating growth of \nmid-high impact, mid-high potential RWE.\n\u2022Approaches to strengthen and identification of best models to scale-up \nfor viable and potential RWE and micro-enterprises. We intended to \nlearn how and where in the value chain we can transform the lives of \nwomen by offering technical wherewithal, finance/market support, and \nnetwork connections besides building and assisting strong narrative \nsupport to amplify RWE voices in policy discourse.\n\u2022Landscape analysis to identify new/existing opportunities as entry points \nfor RWE through continuous engagement to build their product, value \nproposition, network\u2019s capacity, and building linkages for sustainable \nbusinesses.\nIdentification of Problems through Formative Phase (8 months): From \nJune 2022 to January 2023, Start-Up!, New Delhi a private consultancy, and \nIndian Institute of Bank Management (IIBM), Guwahati a premier institute \nconducted a mixed method primary and secondary research study to ascertain \nbarriers to entry for women entrepreneurs, gender norms, policy frameworks, \nmotivations and efficacy of government interventions. Start Up! designed and \nconducted In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) with 25 sector experts and dialogue \nsessions with a total of 166 rural women entrepreneurs (RWE) comprising of \n96 RWE in Assam and 70 RWE in West Bengal. The RWE interviewed by Start \nUp! was largely in stages 0-3 (stage 0- seed stage, 1- self-employed or striving, \n2-start-up, 3 - stable or steadfast) of entrepreneurship. Less than 5% of RWE \nwere in stage 4 of scale and sector-shaper entrepreneurship. Given the current \nscenario, it\u2019s relevant for BBC to uplift RWE struggling in stage 0-3. Please \nrefer to page 4 and from page number 24 - 33 of the research report of Start \nUp! to know more about the various stages of entrepreneurship. IIBM\u2019s \nresearch (which is currently ongoing), includes both secondary and primary \nsources, across 5 districts in Assam (Kamrup Rural, Nalbari, Baksa, Goalpara \nand Sivsagar) and 3 districts in West Bengal (Coochbehar, Jalpaiguri and \nDarjeeling). There are 6 value chains that the research has focused on, namely, \nMushroom, Piggery, Floriculture, Dairy, Handloom and Tea. IIBM has \nintensively engaged with a total of 300 Women Entrepreneurs (50 women \nentrepreneurs from each value chain) along with 20 stakeholder consultations \nwhich includes aggregators from Mushroom and Piggery value chain, Eri Silk \nproducer company, Tea Board officials, company promoting floriculture, tea \nbrokers, handloom designers and market aggregators, Micro Finance \nInstitutions.\n \nAt RWE level, our key research and findings from pilot suggests:\n\u2022Stereotypical gender roles: In the Edelgive Foundation study, 70% of \nthe 1,235 women entrepreneurs admitted that domestic workload was \nOak Application Form     9\ntheir primary responsibility. Most women felt that it was against their \nculture/values to let their husband/other family members partake in \nhousehold chores.\n\u2022Top value chains for women: In the state of Assam and West Bengal \nthere is a huge untapped potential for upward mobility of RWE in the \nfollowing value chains : \noIn Assam: Tea with a special focus on small tea growers (women) \nand handloom.\noIn Assam and West Bengal: Livestock (pig, goat, poultry).\noIn West Bengal: Dairy and agriculture.\noEco-tourism and cultural tourism were identified as areas of huge \npotential in Assam.\n\u2022Access to information through digital skills: RWE do not have \naccess to appropriate information or guidance which is specific to their \nbusiness. It needs to be mentioned that most of the RWE are so involved \nin the operationalisation of their business that their attempts to seek \nadditional information are rather limited. \noIn Assam (92%) and West Bengal (87%) RWE strongly feel that \nlack of digital skill is an obstacle in expanding their business.\n\u2022Business skills for running an enterprise: Women usually run their \nenterprise as an informal entity and are not able to implement their \nbusiness management skills in formalising their entities owing to lack of \nskills, mentoring and coaching support. \noIn Assam (67%) and West Bengal (60%) RWE admitted that lack of \nbusiness knowledge and financial constraints contribute to \nstunted growth of their enterprise.\n\u2022Risk taking aptitude with respect to finance and business \nexpansion:  RWE do not demonstrate risk taking aptitude while \nmanaging their businesses. The average investment in starting their \nenterprise is INR 18,705 and almost 20% did not invest anything \n(Edelgive Foundation study). Further from this study, it was revealed \nthat only 9% of them took some loan. Women revealed that they do not \nwant to take loans because of the fear of inability to repay the loan, \nwhich would negatively impact their family and family pride. Since \nwomen do not have assets in their name, a large majority (83%) also feel \nthat they cannot mortgage assets to secure loans, if required. This \nmajorly deters women from taking loans. Further, 1% of women have \navailed of any government scheme and this is primarily because just \nabout 11% are aware of any schemes. Less than a third (29%) of those \nwho applied, could avail the scheme.  Considering a large proportion of \nwomen did not consider applying to the schemes even if aware (79%), \nthey were asked the reason behind this. Major reasons cited by these \nwomen were: non-availability of required documents (17%), thought the \nprocess is complex (15%), did not feel the need for any support (13%), \nand believed that such schemes are only to support the rich (7%). \noThe lack of financing remains the chief concern - 90 percent of \nwomen entrepreneurs in the country rely on informal sources of \nfinancing.\nOak Application Form     10\noIn Assam (83%) and West Bengal (60%), RWE are not aware of any \nfinancial linkage opportunities and an abysmal percentage (10-\n20%) in both states are aware of the government benefits for RWE \n(as per Start-Up study).\nOur Proposed Approach: Based on the reports, research findings and our \ncollaborative partner's experience in the sector, we know that women's \nentrepreneurship is a significant tool of empowerment for women, and \nthrough BBC we want to create an urge within the stakeholders across the \nboard to support this and contribute to the cause. We intend to do this through \necosystem transformation by shifting the mindset (where \nentrepreneurship become aspirational), infusion of innovation, \nestablishment of formal-informal RWE associations/hubs, and creation \nof new evidence based knowledge products for dissemination at two \nintervention levels:\n\u2022At the 3P (Policy-Players-Processes) Ecosystem Design Level: We \nwant to align our focus on bankers, financial, social, technology \ninstitutions and regulators to design and develop new products and \nprocesses for including women entrepreneurs from diverse socio-\neconomic profiles in value chains.\n\u2022At an Operational Demonstration-Delivery Level: We seek \ninvestments for long-term training, coaching and mentorship of women \nentrepreneurs to build access to capital, markets, and technologies for \nwomen entrepreneurs to scale. This will help in the co-creation of \nmultiplying social/ professional networks of grassroots business women \nand develop women entrepreneurs\u2019 voices and capacity to influence \neconomic and developmental agendas.\n\u2022At each level, as per the strength of respective BBC partner and \ncollective effort, our findings confirmed that five thematic capitals \nmost influence RWE on various stages of entrepreneurship lifecycle \n(seed, self-employed, start-up, stable and scale up) and are worth \ninvesting in:\n1.Personhood Capital : Autonomy or self/personhood. Celebrate and \nrecognize rural women entrepreneurs locally, at district-levels and \nacross states through running media campaigns to share stories of the \ntrue contribution of RWE.\n2.Knowledge Capital: Competencies or knowledge, skills. Non-\nconventional business management, mentoring and business leadership \nprograms \u2013 programs that are local and accessible, rooted in the RWE \ncontext, with faculty that comprises technical experts as well as role \nmodel RWE.\n3.Financial Capital: Access and control over resources, or ownership of \ncapital, assets tools and technology. Building narratives that build the \nconfidence of bankers in RW as credit-worthy and sound investment \nopportunity.\n4.Social Capital: Relationships or personal and professional social \nnetworks for collectivization to organize trade fairs, summits to amplify \nvoice and act as pressure groups to negotiate with family, market, \ngovernment etc.\nOak Application Form     11\n5.Recognition Capital: Increase RWE\u2019s reputation capital in their locus \nof control and influence through stories, films and awards.\n \nIn addition to this, BBC strongly recommends following value chain agnostic \ninputs are necessary for rural women to become entrepreneurs:\n1. Recognition for them that they are individuals who breathe life and have \nall the potential to do what they want.\n2. Access to awareness and knowledge on what are possibilities for them \nto do in their limited environments and unlimited responsibilities.\n3. Negotiations skill within the family to get time off to do what they \nchoose to do.\n4. Enabling environment of women and others who will build and amplify \nthe above.\n5. Working capital initially.\n6. Money management and financial literacy.\n7. Access to bank accounts.\nUsing Oak\u2019s Funding: With this context, through BBC partners, we seek to \nboost the entrepreneurial spirit in women and plot women\u2019s entrepreneurship \nas one of the key pathways to advance women\u2019s economic empowerment in \nIndia. It also aims to get stakeholders across the board including the \ngovernment, corporate, academia, think tanks, sector experts, philanthropy, \ninvestors, funding agencies, and not-for-profit sector together because we \nbelieve that it is only through synchronized efforts would we be able to create \na thriving transformational ecosystem for rural women entrepreneurship. AIF \nin the capacity of an intermediary partner is requesting funds from Oak \nFoundation to commission:\n\u2022A planning phase (9-12 months) will focus on the following activities \nnecessary towards effective implementation: \na. Onboarding of program team\nb. Conducting individual scoping studies by the individual partners \nto initiate their interventions\nc. Formalization and constitution of the different committees and \nfunctions within the BBC. Further details on this maybe referred \nto in Page no. 44 in the BBC Strategic Program Design document, \nas enclosed with this proposal.\nd. A Resource Mobilisation Plan which will include a toolkit for the \npartners to refer to with respect to the different areas from where \nresources may be leveraged, different types of resources that can \nbe leveraged, and what stages.\ne. A robust MEL plan will be owned by the Strategic Programme \nManagement Committee (SPMC), and an agency will be \nonboarded for external evaluation of the program.\n6. An implementation phase (13 - 32 months) which will include \ndemonstration and generating evidence from pilots covering select \nvalue chains; engaging with ecosystem players; \nOak Application Form     12\norchestrating mobilisation of RWEs within and across value chains; and \ndesign and roll out the communication strategy.\n7.Consolidation phase (33-48 months) : focus on the sustainability of \nthe initiative. This will include documentation, dissemination and \ncapacity building for greater adoption and promotion of successful \nstrategies. Resource mobilisation to sustain and grow the outcomes will \nbe a key focus area.\nDuring the implementation phase when BBC is able to demonstrate \ntransformative change in a small (in relative terms) number of RWE in select \nvalue chains; during and after the consolidation phase, BBC would amplify the \nimpact of its models through the following key allies:\n1. The MSME space\n2. Market systems\n3. Officers specific to the market systems\n4. Banks or rural credit facilities\n5. Large organisations in civil society like SEWA and others to see how \nthey have cracked what they have\n6. NRLM kind of initiatives for linkage\n7. Mens groups in the village levels\nEquity, Diversity, and Inclusion: Yes, AIF is committed to addressing it. All \nthe BBC partners are chosen to bring equity in opportunities, diversity in \nchoosing the target population, and inclusion of otherwise marginalized RWE. \nThe unique value addition from BBC is that it\u2019s designed to work at the \nintersection of finance and empowerment with an imperative to understand \nthe economics behind entrepreneurship to create an enabling and conducive \nenvironment for women-owned enterprises. In other women-focused \ninterventions, usually few elements are addressed that too in silos and more \nimportantly, from a social lens only. For RWE to be successful, enterprises \nneed to be nurtured where they are with skills relevant to the local context.", "6. PLACE HOLDER": "6. PLACE HOLDER", "7. OBJECTIVES": "7.

A collaborative is a temporary alliance or partnering of \ngroups in order to achieve a common purpose or to engage in joint \nactivity. Forming collaboratives with other groups of similar values, \ninterests, and goals will allow AIF and BBC members to combine their \nresources and become more powerful than when they each acted alone \nand therefore increase their collective potential for success.

If some of your \noutcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? \n(300 words):\n1. Research suggests women who earn in rural areas are more prone to \ngender-based domestic violence as there is a constant power \nstruggle as to who will own the money and spend it. The BBC program \nwill have to allocate resources to enhance provision of social security \nservices for existing and emerging RWE to minimize the impact of risk \nfactors at the household level.\n2. Entrepreneurship development is a long-term resource-intensive \ngame, besides in a collaborative-based partnership disagreement on a \nmutual goal and objective can threaten the success of the program. \nTherefore, rather than focusing on short-term quantitative outputs, the \ngrant program could focus on longer-term outcomes over a period of 5-\n10 years since ecosystem players on the groundwork in fragmented \nways.\n3. Working with governments is imperative, yet hard. Organizations would \nneed time and capacity building to focus on systems change and \nengage other stakeholders in congruent ways. Mainstream adoption of \nmodels will not move unless backed by data and evidence. This would \nrequire investment in research, business case development, and \ncreating a new and strategic narrative for RWE.\n4. At an operational level, forming and managing a collaborative can be a \nvery time-consuming and bureaucratic process that can take away \ntime from working directly on campaign issues and organization tasks. \nTo mitigate this risk, AIF will encourage democratic decision-making \nand sustained action by managing power dynamics within the group \nthrough transparent communication and appreciative inquiry for best \npractices, strategic planning, and organizational culture to increase the \nmomentum of initiatives.\n5.

Context (The context section should not exceed two pages.)\n6a. Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, \ngovernance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nAID is a volunteer driven organisation based in the US with thirty chapters and \nabout 400 volunteers. There is a Board of Directors with six members currently. \nAll board members are long-time volunteers with ten to twenty years\u2019 experience \nwithin AID. There is an elected Executive Board (EB) consisting of nine to ten \nmembers and elected for a term of two years, responsible for operation and \ncoordination across chapters. There are two full time Development Coordinators \nbased in the US, who spend a few months working with the partners in India as \nwell. Another full time person works with our partners in eastern India and is \nbased in Kolkata.\n \nThere are five Jeevansaathis who work full time on various issues and across India. \nThey were long-time AID volunteers in the US who have gone back and started \nwork at the grassroots decades ago.\n \nAID works with close to 75 grassroots organizations across India on agriculture, \nhealth, education, gender and environmental justice.\n \nCurrently AID has a part time accountant based in India helping us. AID is looking \nto hire a part time person in the US as well within the next 2 months.\n \nAbout 37% of the leadership is women. There is a conscious effort to increase \ndiversity along the lines of faith, gender and caste.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20135\n6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nAID was started in 1991 as a volunteer-based organization at College Park, \nMaryland by students from India interested in community development and social \njustice. Over the years the idea behind AID appealed to many and interested \npeople formed chapters in many cities in the US. Today there are 30 chapters with \nabout 400 volunteers.\n \nAID began by supporting grassroots NGOs working in under-served areas. As AID \ngrew, so did its network at the grassroots in India. We understood the \ninterconnected nature of the problems and the need to work with the most \nmarginalized communities on health, education, agriculture, gender and the \nenvironment. Today, along with its partners, AID reaches out directly to several \nmillion people and strives to strengthen communities under their own leadership.\n \nA few prominent efforts:\n1. The Eureka educational program in Tamil Nadu was designed to improve \nthe quality of education, particularly math, science and language, in \nmarginalized communities. This program works with 80,000 children \nthrough 1,000 village educational centers throughout Tamil Nadu.\n2. In 2009 Cyclone Aila inundated the islands the Sunderbans in W Bengal \nwith saline water. During initial relief efforts, AID realized that reviving \nagriculture was critical to the community\u2019s well-being. Starting with 25 \nfarmers in 2009 today AID has worked with 25,000 farmers and helped them \nadopt sustainable organic agriculture. It has also facilitated sales of the \norganic produce in Kolkata.\nIn 2018, AID initiated a community based program on watershed development in 4 \ntribal districts of Jharkhand, bringing together grassroots groups and a resource \norganization. The project had a tremendous impact in its first year itself bringing \nwater and greenery to some of the drought stricken villages and over the last two \nyears. There has been a lot of demand from the neighboring villages but we are \nlimited by funds. In these 2 years we have treated close to 3000 hectares of land \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\nand planted about 3000 trees and hope for it to scale.\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nAID works with marginalized communities and groups across India to address \nissues they currently face. Through experience over the last two decades, AID has \nlearnt that the issues are cross-cutting and its support should not be limited to \nsingle issues, but rather towards an overall dignified life for the communities.\n \nAgriculture: The majority of India\u2019s population still has livelihoods based on \nagriculture and yet, farmers have been in distress for over a decade. AID has been \naddressing the agrarian crisis in India by -\n1. By providing relief to farmers in crisis: AID helps families of farmers who \nhave committed suicide and those affected by natural disasters, by \nproviding immediate support as well as logistical support to interface with \nthe administration. AID has worked with farmers after several natural \ndisasters helping them reclaim their land and restart agriculture. AID is \nworking in Sunderbans as we speak to revive agriculture after Cyclone \nAmphan.\n2. By promoting sustainable practices:  AID helps to train farmers to move \naway from chemical farming towards ecologically sustainable and \neconomically viable techniques. AID also works with landless families and \ntribal communities to improve food security through the practice of nutrition \ngardens.\n3. Advocating for farmer friendly policies:  AID works with advocacy groups to \nmake governments implement farmer-friendly policies.\nAID works with about 50,000 farmers mainly in West Bengal, Telangana, Andhra \nPradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.\n \nHealth: AID works with several partners across India to improve health equity and \nmaking quality and affordable healthcare accessible to all.\n1. AID works with physicians and health workers in remote areas without \naccess to healthcare - innovating in extremely low resource settings, \ntraining village health workers and developing appropriate technologies and \nunderstanding social determinants of health.\n2. AID supports groups demanding access to affordable healthcare as a right \nby organizing people to hold the public health system accountable.\n3. Along with its partners, AID understands that food insecurity is a major \ncause of illness and undernourished children face irreversible damage \nbefore the age of 3. AID supports nutritional programs for children under 3 \nand works to improve the Government run Anganwadis.\nAID works with healthcare partners in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil \nNadu, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka reaching out to at least 120,000 people.\n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nEducation: AID works to make culture appropriate education accessible to all.\n1. Developing Curriculum:  Activity-based lessons with interactive materials \nmotivate children to explore concepts from multiple angles rather than by \nrote.  Government, non-government schools as well as after-school centers \nuse these methods and materials.\n2. Strengthening Public Schools: AID partners engage with government \nschools to improve teaching methods and see that all children have a right \nto meaningful, quality education.\n3. Reaching the Unreached: In underserved communities, AID partners run \nschools and bridge courses to help students in remote and tribal areas \nprepare for and adjust in mainstream schools.  AID also supports model \nschools implementing effective innovative techniques in rural areas\nAID and its partners reach out to 330,000 children through its education \nprograms.\n \nGender Equality:  AID works with women's groups towards a gender just society. \nIt supports education of women young and old, advocating for their rights and \nencouraging leadership by women and access to independent livelihoods. We also \npartner with groups providing support to survivors of violence.\n \nWe have been working with transgender groups advocating for their equality in \nsociety,  striving for access to a dignified livelihood and equal access to \nhealthcare.\n \nEnvironmental Justice:\n1. AID empowers communities to take action to defend the environment by \nequipping communities to measure/monitor pollution of land, water and air \nand raise it with the officials.\n2. AID promotes community control of natural resources helping communities \ngain their rights under the Forest Rights Act.\nAID engages with communities for watershed restoration and afforestation efforts.\n6e.

(You may use additional space if you have more than three objectives)?. \nUnder each objective describe the activities that your organisation will undertake to \nachieve it, including time frame and the results or outcomes you expect to achieve.\n7.1.a. Objective 1 (maximum one sentence):\nUse the Forest Rights Act to claim legal rights for individuals and communities and \nstrengthen grassroots democratic institutions in 200 villages across 4 districts of \nnorthern West Bengal.\n7.1.c. Objective 1\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\nActivites:\nThis project will work under the principle that section 5 of the Forest Rights Acts, \nempowers the Gram Sabha to protect wildlife, biodiversity, human habitat and \nstop any activity that is a threat to their natural and cultural heritage of the forest \ndwellers. It also asks all authorities to comply with the Gram Sabha decisions to \ncontrol access to community forest resources or stopping any harmful activities.\n1. Developing written and audio-visual materials such as presentations, \ndocumentaries, vernacular books, newsletters or magazines to raise \nawareness in the communities about Forest Rights Acts (FRA), including all \ntechnical details.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - Jan 2020 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n2. Two workshops annually for the community on FRA.\n7.1.b. Objective 1\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\n1. Gram Sabhas in at least the 10 sites will meet regularly and take decisions \ndemocratically. By the end of 3 years, a majority of the Gram Sabhas in the \nentire work area will be meeting regularly with participation of women and \nyouth. The Gram Sabhas will be engaged in filing the CFRs.\n2. Empowered with the knowledge of FRA, the community will be more \nassertive about their rights both at individual and community level. In the \npast they have resisted clear felling of trees on community land. In terms of \nindividual rights, we can expect people to use their constitutional rights like \nfiling police complaints against harassment and intimidation.\n3. Community forest mapping will help the community in conservation as well \nas in improving livelihoods (eg using bamboo or other NTFPs sustainably). \nThis will also help them in asserting their rights on the community forests\n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - July 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n3. Organize 20 community level meetings in villages. 6 district level meetings \nand 1 state level meeting every year.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - throughout the year / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n4. Organize an annual alliance building meeting with similar and like minded \norganizations across the country.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - June 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n5. The site selection and the learning centers will be in areas where the Gram \nSabhas have been activated in the past. A village level leadership committee \nwill be formed to make the Gram Sabha functional regularly through a \ncommunity process so that it has meetings at a democratically decided \nfrequency and the minutes of the assembly are preserved. Women will be in \nthe leadership role in these committees.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - Dec 2020 / Y2 - No  / Y3 - No )\n6. Organize the mapping of the community forests to apply for Community \nForest Rights (CFR) to the District Magistrate or the Sub Divisional officer. \nWe plan to file 50 CFRs every year.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - April 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n7.

Objective 2\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\n1. More than 15 indigenous communities live in the forest villages. None of the \ncommunities are engaged in mainstream agricultural practices as we see in \nGangetic alluvial plain. We expect to involve these diverse forest dwelling \ncommunities into a new livelihood opportunity through cluster farming. At \nthe end of 3 years the selected community members will have a secure \nsource of income from farming.\n2. This sustainable organic farming is based on the idea of agroecological \nfarming which includes different techniques of soil and water management, \nintercropping, mix cropping, promotion and cultivation of indigenous \nvarieties, drip irrigation, mulching, preparation of organic manure, \ncomposting, integrated crop management. At the end of 3 years farmers \ninvolved in the cluster will learn to grow crops organically in a sustainable \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201310\n7.2.c. Objective 2\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\nActivites:\n \n1.Community mobilization:\nThe entire livelihood initiative through cluster farming is going to be \nimplemented in a democratic way through the process of participatory \ndecision making by the Gram Sabha (GS). The GS will identify interested \nfarmers and the common land for farming. This mobilization process \ninvolves regular meetings and interaction with the respected GS in the \nvillage in order to convince them to take up and monitor this activity as the \nabsolute decision making authority of the forest village as per FRA.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - Sept. 2020 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n2.Identification of sites and cluster formation:\nThe Gram Sabha (GS) will be interacting with the interested farmers in the \nvillage and will form the cluster with 20 to 25 farmers.. Then the cluster will \ndecide in presence of GS about their strategy planning, budget, sharing of \nprofit etc. The GS will be playing an instrumental role in identifying the sites \nof farming as well. 10 sites of 5 hectares each will be identified to start with \nin year 1. This site selection involves meetings and having agreement with \nthe land owners for private land and passing resolution in GS meetings - this \nprocess will be done by GS.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - Oct. 2020 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n         3. Central workshop with community leaders:\nThe central level conceptual workshop will be organised with some of the \nleading farmers in the clusters along with the selected members of Gram \nSabha (GS) and a few members from the monitoring team so that the entire \nconcept of this livelihood initiative can be imparted in the community. This \nworkshop will be based on the idea of agroecological farming which \nincludes different techniques of soil and water management, intercropping, \nmix cropping, promotion and cultivation of indigenous varieties and so on. \nThere will be 1 central level workshop every year.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - July 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n        4. Follow up workshop on ground:\nThe follow up workshop will be organised with the farmers at the ground \nlevel. This will be more of a hand holding training with the farmers where \nway by using all those methods and concepts learned from the \nagroecological workshops.\n3. This farming practice will start with 250 farmers in 10 villages. Each year at \nleast 100 new farmers will be added to the cluster. The total cultivable area \nwill also be increased each year depending on the availability of adjacent \nland. It is expected that the farmer\u2019s annual income from the farming sector \nwill be increased at least by 40% at the end of 3 years. \n4. This livelihood initiative will help convert 50 hectare of unused fallow land \ninto productive land by 3 years along with its plantation work with 1,00,000 \nsapling  for the regeneration of forest.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201311\ndifferent methods and techniques of agroecological farming will be learned. \nThere will be 2 follow up workshops every year in different geographical \nlocations.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - May 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n        5. Farming:\nIn year 1 a total 250 farmers will be involved in the farming activity in 10 \nselected sites of total 50 hectare land. Farmers will be selecting their \nseasonal crops for farming. There will be 4 different sites of \nvermicomposting to supply enough organic manure to all 10 sites.  Mainly \nthe local varieties of vegetables along with a few oil seeds will be grown in 2 \nseasons each year.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - Dec 2020 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n          6. Plantation:\nConservation of forest has been one of the primary ideas of this livelihood \ninitiative. 4 sites will be identified for raising nurseries of around 10,000 \nsaplings which would take 3 months - from January 2021 to March 2021. \nThe plantation work will start from April 2021. Different wood varieties that \nare found naturally in the forest area (native variety) will be selected for \nplantation along with a few teak plantations in the fringe.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - April 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n          7. Marketing linkages and selling of produce:\nMarketing linkages will be established in the local areas and in the nearest \ntown for the organically produced vegetables.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - April-May 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n7.3.a. Objective 3 (maximum one sentence):\nTo develop a new rung of leadership from the youth (12 to 18 years) through an \neducation that is rooted in their socio-cultural-ecological context and empowers \nthem to develop self-reliance and live in their culture with dignity.\n7.3.b. Objective 3\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\n1. We envisage to have a group of youth leaders in the targeted 6 villages. At \nthe end of 3 years the youth group in the village will have comprehensive \nknowledge about FRA. This group will be instrumental in mobilizing the \nforest dwelling community in accessing their rights vested in FRA. Members \nof this group will be participating in regular Gram Sabhas meetings.\n2. It is expected that all the learners of the 6 centers will become aware of the \nhistorical socio-economic and the political context of the forest villagers. \nThe learners will also become aware of the ecological context as to how they \nare living in harmony with the forest. They will participate in the community \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201312\n7.3.c. Objective 3\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\nActivites:\n1.Workshop to develop learning modules:\nDevelop a model of education that focuses on the social, economic and \nenvironmental needs of local forest dwelling communities - addressing \nissues such as responding to climate change, conservation of forests, \nsupporting existing sustainable livelihood practices,reducing migration and \nmaintaining inter-community harmony. This will be done by members of \nsolidarity groups, community facilitators and the Gram Sabha members who \nwill be involved in running the 6 learning centres.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - Feb-March 2021 / Y2 - No / Y3 - No )\n2.Follow up review workshop:\nThe Follow up workshop will be essentially organised for reviewing the \nlearning modules, discussion on the pedagogy and also developing strategy \nplanning for running the learning centres.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - June 2021 / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\n       3. Selection of 6 sites for learning centres:\nStart learning centers and community schools in six areas (four in \nAlipurduar-Jalpaiguri and two in the hills of Darjeeling and Kalimpong) for \nthe youth to be conversant in the developed modules while also providing \ntutoring support to dropout students and those struggling in their \nmainstream curriculum.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - Sept-Dec 2020 / Y2 - No / Y3 - No )\n        4. Organize an inter-community cultural festival and school-level \ncompetitions annually:\nThe festivals and cultural events will help create a space for better \nrelationships between the communities. Given the multi ethnicity of the \ncommunity this type of inter-community festival helps build cohesion in the \ngroup which enables them to work together in the conservation practice, \nprotecting their forest, claiming their constitutional rights and also \naccessing the livelihood opportunities.\nTimeframe:  ( Y1 - Throughout the year / Y2 - continue / Y3 - continue )\nforest conservation efforts.\n3. This learning process will empower them with the capacity to interface with \nthe forest department and the government in terms of accessing their \nconstitutional rights and entitlements as a forest dwelling community.\n4.  The festivals and cultural events will create a space for better relationships \nbetween the communities. This will be understood and measured by \ncollecting anecdotal evidence.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201313", "8. COOPERATION": "8. Cooperation\nDescribe the level of cooperation with other organisations and networks \nand explain how this cooperation helps achieve your goals (maximum 300 \nwords):\nThe tropical forests of sub-Himalayan Bengal in India contain rich biodiversity and \nanthropogenic wealth. Several indigenous communities, such as Rava, Mech, \nDukpa, Garo and many Jharkhandi adivasi groups (Oraon, Kheria, Santhal, Munda, \nBaraik) live here. Lepcha, Limbu, Rai, Tamang, Sherpa and other ethnic groups \nnow being generically termed as Gorkha  also live here. Many of these people were \nbrought in from surrounding states and forced to stay in the ghettoized \nsettlements of forest villages set up by British foresters as labor colonies in the \nlate 19th and early 20th Century.\nColonial laws passed by the British Government made it unlawful for forest tribes \nto even live within the forest or source their daily needs. The British also \nconverted forest land to monoculture commercial timber plantations destroying \nthe forest ecosystem in the process.\nAfter Independence the Indian Government too, created policies with similar goals. \nEven laws passed ostensibly for conservation targeted forest communities as \n\u201cdestructive\u201d to the environment and evicted them. Illegal timber harvesting \ncontinued and contributed to heavy deforestation, often also victimizing forest \ncommunities. Today, the timber industry takes advantage of poverty among these \ncommunities and employs them to harvest timber from the forest thus adding to \nongoing environmental degradation.\nThe Forest Rights Act (FRA), passed in 2006, gave joint ownership of forest areas \nto both the Government and indigenous forest-based communities. It empowered \nthese communities to form governing institutions that would administer the forest \ntogether with the Forest Department. Currently, it suffers from inadequate \nimplementation due to lack of awareness among the affected communities.\nThe main actors involved in the larger context of the work are the peoples\u2019 social \nmovement, an NGO, the forest communities and solidarity groups. Another \nstakeholder is the Forest Department.\nPeople from the community are involved in every step of the process from site \nselection to forming the groups to participate in agriculture. The learning centers \non the other hand will be open to all youth of 12-18 years in the community. Gram \nSabhas will be the main agency involved in the filing of the CFR as well as \nmapping the community forest areas.", "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. Impact\nWhat is the change you want to achieve from the overall project? (maximum \n300 words):\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201314\n10. Evaluation\nHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):\nA monitoring team will be formed for each project site, consisting of community \nleaders and project coordinators. This team will meet the communities each month \nand hold review meetings every 2 months. Gram Sabhas will also be monitoring \nthe work at their respective sites. At the inter site level, the existing secretariat of \nthe group will do the monitoring on a monthly basis\nAdditionally, for the learning centers, the monitoring and evaluation team will \ninclude civil society members and solidarity groups who will support in developing \nthe learning modules. There would be 2 evaluations in a year for the learning \ncenters. The first year would be focussed on understanding the efficacy and \nacceptance of the learning modules. The feedback will be used for modifications \nand adjustments.\nAID volunteers will also carry out an annual evaluation by being on site as they \nhave for the past 5 years.\nThe evaluation questions for the livelihood part would be to see how the \ncommunity is bonding and making decisions, if they have been able to \noperationalize and start agriculture and how many times they are meeting and \ninteracting with their respective Gram Sabhas.\nFor the learning centers, the regularity of the centers and the attendance in them \nwould indicate the acceptance of the learning modules. Further on in the program, \ninteractions with the youth will give an idea about their understanding of the local \nenvironment and care for it. Beyond that, it would be important to eventually see \nthe youth participating in the Gram Sabha meetings and playing an active role in \nit.\nFor the Forest Rights component, we will need to see how many resource maps \nare developed for the community forests, followed by how many CFRs are filed. \nFinally, it would be important to see if the community is using the community \nforest land in a way that is beneficial to them.\nTo understand the impact, we would look at the following:\n\u2022Number of people participating in agriculture, learning at each site\n\u2022Change in the production of vegetables over the years at each site\n\u2022Observing the increase/decrease in the participation of women and out \nmigrants\n\u2022Change in the mortality rate of the plantations\n\u2022Forest area mapped and the number of Community Forest Rights \napplication\n\u2022Number of learners in each center\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201315", "11.

Initially, the \nprogram has a period of three years and will span over 100 districts, of which 15-\n20 have high apparel-based migration, to sustainably impact 10 million migrants \nover five years. We aim to enable systemic improvements that build socio-economic \nresilience for over 139 million migrants.\nThe MRC has a strong affinity with Oak\u2019s commitment to address global, social and \nenvironmental issues, particularly among the disadvantaged. The MRC enables the \nOak Foundation to advance these goals both systemically and at scale, whilst \nleveraging the commitment of large institutional funders such as Omidyar \nNetwork, Dell Foundation, H.T. Parekh Foundation, and Godrej Group, at a time of \nheightened need.\nMore than 95% of migrants that we support belong to Scheduled Castes, \nScheduled Tribes, and other backward classes. We aim to address the inequalities \nwithin these communities.\nIn addition, several components of MRC\u2019s strategy and approach are aligned, \nincluding but not limited to:  \n1) Building agency of migrant families and safeguarding labour rights.\n2) Working with migrants specifically engaged in the construction and textiles \nsector.\n3) Working with industry including the textiles industry to build an inclusive \neconomy.\n4) Focusing on systemic improvements.", "4.

Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, \ngovernance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nDignity Alliance International (DAI) is independent UK based charity but also part \nof Jan Sahas family. DAI is committed to end all forms of forced labour and \nviolence against women and children across South Asia through the partnership \nwith local organizations. The Proposed program will be implemented by Jan \nSahas*. Jan Sahas is a 20-year-old community centric organization working \nintensively in 78 districts across eleven states of India. Jan Sahas is working with \nthe most excluded social groups on safe migration and workers\u2019 protection; and \nprevention of sexual violence against women and children. At the time of its \ninception in 2000, Jan Sahas worked in one district of Madhya Pradesh with a staff \nstrength of 12 volunteers. Today, we have grown to a strong workforce of \n1882 (523 full-time and 1,359 part-time) staff and 640 volunteers spread across \n18,000+ villages and towns across the country.\nAt Jan Sahas, we are committed to ensuring that our staff and projects operate \nwithin the framework of diversity, equity, inclusion and we actively promote and \nexpect gender-sensitive behaviour. In line with best practice, we aim to have a \n50% representation of women among the project staff, preferably in leadership \nroles and four of our seven Board members are female. \nOur organisational structure comprises cross-functional teams. However, the \nboard of Directors are the main governing body of the organisation, followed by \nthe Chief Executive Officer. Each team (Fundraising, Finance, Programme, \nResearch, Partnerships, Strategy, Technology) has a Director followed by the \nManagers, who are the thematic leaders of each field. Among the team are \nassociates and programme coordinators, followed by the officers and field staff. \nPlease refer to the organogram for a pictorial representation of the structure \n(Uploaded as attachment in downloads).\nThe team members have been divided into different management groups, each \nwith their own roles and responsibilities:\n1. Governing Board: responsible for driving forward the strategic direction of the \norganisation, setting organizational plans and priorities and managing risk and \naccountability. \n2. Senior Management Team: responsible for organizational decision-making and \nstrategic planning. Leaders from key departments represent the concerns of their \nthematic areas.\n3.

The remaining 11.8% is divided across fixed \n(1.70%), flexible expense (5.90%), research (2.25%) and service costs (1.95%). \nFunders such as Omidyar Network and Ford Foundation have invested \nsignificantly in Jan Sahas\u2019s core support, with Omidyar Network, Michael & Susan \nDell Foundation, Skoll Foundation, and Godrej providing unrestricted support, \nenabling us to build capacity and scale quickly. Within the next year, we wish to \nraise funds from the Indian organisations, shifting our current funding status.\nWe have secured funding (under MRC alone) from the following sources:\n1.

Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nJan Sahas has been working with the most excluded communities for over two \ndecades, providing support on issues such as prevention and response to gender-\nbased violence, forced labour, and caste-based manual scavenging. This includes: \n1) Uniquely blending our grassroots-led approach with a focus on scale, facilitating \ndirect support in ~60 districts across nine states of India, serving~2,000,000 \nwomen and girls across program areas, tracking >200,000 migrant workers, \nrescuing >4.2k bonded and child labourers, and delivering >128,000 entitlements \nto migrants. During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jan Sahas \nworked with 42 non-profits across 19 states in India to address needs of >1 million \nmigrant families through immediate relief support. There have been a few projects \nthat have been instrumental in achieving this. These include: an Initiative to \nsubstantially reduce the practice of Forced and Child Labour (F&CL) in cotton \nproduction in Madhya Pradesh, India; Fighting Forced Labour with Adivasi and \nDalit communities in South Asia; Nirmaan Mazdoor Sashaktikaran Karyakram \n(NMSK) and Bandhuaa Majdoor Mukti Abhiyan.\n2) With support from CBOs (Community Based Organisations), Jan Sahas has \ninfluenced key legislation (The Landmark Prohibition of Employment as Manual \nScavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013), and participates on various \ngovernment working commissions (for example, Government of Madhya Pradesh\u2019s \ncommission on migrant workers, NITI Aayog\u2019s Working Group for Social Justice \nand Empowerment to support on migration).  Jan Sahas\u2019 promoted CBO, Rashtriya \nGarima Abhiyan and has influenced several initiatives at departmental and state \nlevel on the issue of manual scavenging and gender justice. \nJan Sahas aims to address the issues faced specifically by migrant families at an \nunprecedented scale and crucially it has quickly emerged into new geographical \nareas. Thus, Jan Sahas believes in a collaborative approach, partnering with CBOs \nwith similar values across the country to facilitate direct support through its \ninterventions. \n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nOur priority is to adopt a learning-based organic scale-up approach that \nfocuses on quality and continues to ensure strong accountability to our \ncommunities. Based on our learnings from our projects in the space of migration, \nwe have developed a detailed scale up model. \nSince October 2020, we have started working using our current operating model \non the theme in 50 districts and supporting 40 additional civil society \norganizations to intervene in another 50 districts. We are also piloting innovations \nto work at greater scale and update our operating models over the next five years. \nThe key to our success will be a unified technology system: a unified database of \n10 million workers along with their information based on which of the three \nservices (social security, responsible recruitment, and worker protection) they opt \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\nfor. Our Jan Saathi social security entitlements application and national labour \nhelpline will be at the top of our database. We are currently developing this \ntechnology system and intend to integrate these with government systems to \nradically simplify the delivery of benefits to workers.\nTo achieve all of this, we have made our investments in technology, a second line \nof leadership, and strengthening internal systems give us confidence that we can \nbuild capacities that complement our strengths in grassroots reach, experience of \nlarge-scale programs, and commitment to excluded communities to anchor this \ninitiative.\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nThere are an estimated 139 million internal migrant workers in India. Despite \nbeing large contributors to India\u2019s GDP, migrant workers face systematic \ndisenfranchisement due to power imbalance & high vulnerability. As a result, they \nface three principal challenges: Non-recognition by states, & lack of social security \nleading to debt and poverty.\nUnder the proposed project we intend to use the corridor approach (work at \nsource & destination together). The proposed geographic focus is the West \nBengal migration corridor. We have selected 4 high prevalence districts of \nmigration in West Bengal (Murshidabad, Nadia, Bardhaman and Birbhum) \nas source districts & Mumbai-Suburban and Delhi-NCR region as \ndestination areas.\nAccording to Census 2011, West Bengal ranks fourth among states from where \npeople migrate to for work and employment. Approximately 80% of work-migrants \nfrom the state migrate to Maharashtra (45.3%) and Delhi-NCT (34%). Research \nshows that much of the migrant population in the country belong to lower-income \nquintile groups and are likely to be deprived of social security. \nIn 2004-05, approximately 35% of workers in rural West Bengal were out of social \nsecurity coverage and this increased to 50% in 2011-12. Furthermore, according \nto a study on the access to flagship programme benefits and public services in \nWest Bengal, it was found that access to benefits was critically low due to lack of \nawareness, procedural complexities, harassment, apathy of state officials and \nopportunity cost being higher than benefit. \nThe access to benefits is critically limited due to a lack of awareness, delay, \nprocedural complexities, harassment, insensitivity of implementing officials and \nelected representatives, adverse selection & opportunity cost being higher than \nbenefit. Given the high rates of poverty, out-migration and poor access to \nentitlement, it is critical that concerted efforts are placed into improving the social \nsecurity coverage in West Bengal.\nWe decided that launching the MRC now would have the most impact for the \nfollowing reasons:\nUnprecedented political will and demand for Jan Sahas\u2019 support on \nmigrants\u2019 issue: Post-COVID, migrant welfare has become a major political issue:\n1) Central and State governments have embarked on social security registration \ndrives, several have set up migrant welfare commissions. The central government \naccepted $1 billion credit fund from the World Bank to create a social registry for \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139\nstrengthening social security.\n2) Jan Sahas has partnered with multiple governments (for example, Delhi, \nMadhya Pradesh, Telangana) and we are discussing partnerships with several \nothers. Partnering with West Bengal and Maharashtra has been considered in the \nproject plan.\nUnprecedented industry willingness to support migrants, including Jan \nSahas\u2019s mission: Industry bodies such as CREDAI and FICCI have taken up the \ncause of social security as a trust-building measure and to improve the value \nproposition for workers. Four of the largest Indian construction companies (L&T, \nGodrej, Lodha, Mahindra & Mahindra) co-signed an open letter with Jan Sahas, \nadvocating for governments to deliver on its policies including benefits for migrant \nworkers and committing to partner with government and civil society.\nDemonstrated interest from philanthropy and civil society to support \nmigrant workers: Large funders such as Omidyar Network, Azim Premji \nPhilanthropic Initiatives, Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, HT Parekh Foundation \nhave recalibrated strategies to support migrant families. \nWith both need and the potential for high impact, the MRC seeks to harness the \nopportunity to capitalize on opportunity and address systemic at scale. In the 6 \nmonths of operations MRC has registered 1,036,626 migrant households of which \n424,400 were women led, filled 1,192,936 social security applications, ensured \nbenefits received to 847,556 migrant individuals. While, the helpline received 2871 \nand 753 cases were registered through different sources (helpline and field). \nWe are fully cognisant of the threats facing the program and have established a \nplan to address them:\n1) Current and future FCRA law amendments hinder sub-granting funds to \npartner CBOs.\n2) Reduced bargaining power of migrants and the industry\u2019s willingness to \nsupport reforms due to added vulnerability of migrants. Additionally, the impact \nof the pandemic has sparked a change in labour codes.", "7. OBJECTIVES": "7. Objectives (maximum 2,200 words)\nFor a core support grant, state the purpose of this grant request and complete the \nobjectives.  After consultations with an Oak PO, you may decide to summarise your \nmission as one broad objective.

(You may use additional space if you have more than three objectives)?. \nUnder each objective describe the activities that your organisation will undertake to \nachieve it, including time frame and the results or outcomes you expect to achieve.\n7.1.a. Objective 1 (maximum one sentence):\nStrengthening social security delivery system and increasing access to benefits \nand entitlements.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201310\n7.1.c. Objective 1\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\n1. Facilitating social security through community-based volunteers, \nleveraging partnerships with government and industry: key barriers for \nworkers include a lack of awareness, and a complex government system that is \nchallenging to navigate, and a complete lack of a proactive delivery system. \nMRC has built a tech platform as a solution to profile (general information like \nname, residence, mobile, and intervention-specific information) and track \nmigrants. All individuals supported across interventions and location are profiled \nat the first touch point, with subsequent engagements logged on, enabling MRC to \ntrack workers, their progress, enable simplified access to other services, while \nenabling MRC to understand most effective \u2018sales channels\u2019. The platform will be \nbuilt to enable interoperability across government and other civil society systems \nto the extent possible, enabling sharing of information. In the long-term, this could \nsubstitute or supplement government\u2019s own data registrie\nTo overcome the barriers, we intend to train (on this tech platform) and leverage \n59 Jan Saathis and block-level field workers, many of whom are from high-\nmigration and historically excluded communities. In each district, we aim to build \nawareness, onboard workers onto our tech platform, conduct on-the-spot eligibility \nchecks and provide support in accessing key social security benefits (e.g., land \nrights, insurance, education, and other key benefits). The Jan Saathis will register \nthese workers on the platform and update progress after check in calls or follow \nup meetings. Jan Saathis/field workers will also train and draw support from \nvillage-based \u2018barefoot lawyers\u2019 from the community, who will be trained to build \nawareness within their villages regarding entitlements and basic rights. With state \nand industry buy-in through MoUs, Jan Saathis / field workers will help to drive \nsocial security registrations at scale. \n2. Innovations to improve efficiency and sustainability of social security \ndelivery systems: Apart from the Jan Saathi model and continuous improvements \ntherein, the MRC aims to design and implement interventions that enable the \ndelivery of social security faster, better and more cost-efficiently. They will be \nmeasured and tracked through the MRC tech platform in pilot areas, prior to \nscaling. Potential and planned interventions include:\nLeveraging business correspondents for social security delivery. This is an ongoing \nactivity.( Business Correspondents are deployed by banks to deliver basic banking \nservices outside the bank branch. Migrant workers use their services to send and \nreceive remittances and carry out other basic:\na. Banking transactions. We believe the relationship will be mutually beneficial as \nthe BCs will not only get an opportunity to earn additional revenue through \nprovision of complimentary services (migrant registration and social security \n7.1.b. Objective 1\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\n1) 4,00,000 workers and their families registered for, and aware of the key social \nsecurity schemes in 3 years.\n2) 2,40,000 workers receiving key benefits in 3 years\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201311\ndelivery) but also help to increase cross-sell opportunities).\nb. Integrating our social security technology with government systems through \ninteroperable Application Programming Interfaces or integrating with Common \nService Centres by leveraging MoUs for social security delivery with the state \ngovernment. \n7.2.a. Objective 2 (maximum one sentence):\nEnabling responsible recruitment. (this is consistent with the wording of Objective \n1)\n7.2.c. Objective 2\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\n1. Advocate for responsible recruitment within industry, in partnership \nwith financiers, brands and industry associations. We intend to partner and \nadvocate with companies (both of construction and textiles), focusing on the \nlargest companies to strengthen worker support. In particular, we intend to \nleverage financiers (e.g., HDFC Bank), brands (e.g., C&A, H&M, Arvind Mills), and \nindustry bodies (e.g., CII, FICCI, ASSOCHAM, CREDAI), to strengthen their norms \nand expectations from members, and drive downstream improvements across their \nmembership and supply chains. We will also advocate for adherence of norms that \ndisproportionately affect women (e.g., implementation of POSH Act, equal wages \nfor equal work, better sanitation facilities, and fair growth opportunities);\n2. Co-creating mechanisms for developing implementable solutions for \nresponsible recruitment. We aim to engage with the financiers /investors, \nbrands, industry association and companies to identify key priorities, \nopportunities, and gaps in the sector and within the value chain.  Ultimately, we \nwould co-create a pathway for developing some of the solutions for building \nresponsible recruitment practices within the company and its supply chain. The \nsolutions may differ depending on the size and scale of the company and the \nregion or geographies they operate in. Such partnerships and adoption by large \ncompanies in construction and textiles will strengthen worker welfare; likely \nimprove worker retention at a time when companies are facing labour shortages \nand play a signalling role for other companies in the sector too. Our objective \nthrough such engagement is for industry to own such initiatives, including publicly \nowning its success.\n3. New model for placement support by leveraging government portal. We \nhave partnered with the Quality Council of India to pilot the UNNATI portal, which \naims to connect 200 million workers with job providers. Aside from leveraging this \n7.2.b. Objective 2\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\n 1,00,000 workers responsibly recruited in 3 years by 15+ companies and industry \nassociations.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201312\nto influence government planning, we will use our learnings from this in year 2 to \ndesign a model that encompasses our database of migrant workers and the labour \ndemand from large companies to support employment opportunities for migrant \nworkers (e.g., in partnership with existing recruitment agents). \n7.3.a. Objective 3 (maximum one sentence):\nEnabling protection. (consistent with Objectives 1 & 2)\n7.3.c. Objective 3\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\n1.  National, 24X7 migrant multi-lingual labour helpline: Our toll-free \nhelpline will provide information to workers on their rights and entitlements \nand register complaints regarding forced labour. It will facilitate rescue support, \nwhere required in coordination with district authorities. Registering the worker on \nour tech platform also enables the MRC to reconnect with the worker over an \noutgoing call and provide information that allows them to connect to resource \ncentres and Jan Saathis. 30% of the Jan Saathis and helpline staff will be women to \nensure female workers and family members are comfortable to reach out to them \nand can better enable reach.\n2.  Remedial and legal support through lawyers\u2019 initiative forum: the MRC \nwill facilitate dispatch support for cases received over the helpline or through \nother touch points. This includes:\na.  field workers in districts coordinating with local authorities to support/rescue \nworkers in forced labour situations; in recent cases in Madhya Pradesh, MRC staff \nhave advised local authorities, enabling them to deliver rescue efforts \nindependently.   \nb.  legal aid through the Lawyer\u2019s Initiative Forum (a Jan Sahas promoted, pro-\nbono forum of +1,400 lawyers), or part-time lawyers hired in each district.\nFor dispatch services our approach has been to collaborate strategically with other \ncivil society initiatives such as those by ILO, UNDP and Aajeevika Bureau and \nother prominent Civil society Organisations in order to drive systemic changes. In \norder to avoid delicacy of efforts we will transfer cases to network organisations \nwith capacity and presence in the geography.\nOver the next 3-5 years, our goal is to establish the helpline and the field worker \ndispatch support as a standalone public good, adopted by Government, akin to \nChildLine.\n7.3.b. Objective 3\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\nWe aim to reduce forced labour by 60% (in the districts of project operation) by \nmaking worker protection support available to workers.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201313\n3.  Agency and awareness building for self-protection: \na.  At source, the MRC will scale Jan Sahas\u2019s barefoot lawyer volunteer program \nwhich trains motivated, local youths to build awareness and agency in their own \nvillages.\nb.  Prior to migration, each worker under the project will be trained at source on \nrights and entitlements at the destination, remedies available, best practices for \nthem to adopt, and a pocket-sized handbook to keep their own record of work and \nfinancial transactions, along with key information such as the National helpline \nnumber.\nc.  At destination, field workers will engage migrants on rights, socialize MRC \nofferings and provide other critical support to them, including anything identified \nthrough the handbook. \nWe will set up District migration resource centres, these district level units will \nfacilitate personalized information services, advice and trainings for migrants and \ntheir families on availing benefits, legal rights, industry norms, and protective \nmeasures available. The resource centre will also act as a hub for worker \nprotection outreach and dispatch services.\n4.  Research for worker protection:\nEvidence-based knowledge on sexual violence against female migrant workers \nacross the textile and construction value chain, to enable informed \nstrategy/intervention design and policy advocacy towards prevention of sexual \nviolence. The study will identify the factors that enable sexual violence and amplify \nthe experiences of female migrant workers including the root causes for non-\nreporting of such cases formally.", "8.

Evaluation\nHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):\nThe process monitoring flow will consist of the following steps: \n1.  Data entry / collection and analysis: Field Officers, MIS coordinators will collect \nand enter data. Monthly, Quarterly, Annual and SWAT Reports will be generated \nwith data and field visit insights, led by MEL Manager. Reports will include \nrecommendations on further research, rapid assessments, training needs and \nadaptation of strategy, led by the MEL Manager.\n2.  Report Dissemination & learnings: MEL team will share monthly and annually \nwith management; district team leads and partner CBOs. Monthly and annual \nmeetings will take place to share learnings, understand challenges and \ntroubleshoot. Training will be carried out with specific teams, when required and \nannual refresher training will be provided when necessary. \n3.  Senior Management Team (SMT) meetings: based on MEL and team meetings \nfeedback, SMT will discuss major roadblocks, challenges, progress-check, and \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201316\nshare success stories and learnings, and re-align on the way forward. The SMT will \nthen formulate rapid assessments, research and advocacy plans. \nProcess/ Implementation Evaluation: leveraging internal strengths of \ntechnology-based tools and real-time dashboards, we will undertake self-\nevaluations towards improvement of our delivery model and tracking system. As \ndescribed in the MEL framework, progress on KPIs and activities will be monitored \nmonthly and annually, and further \u201cSWAT\u201d teams will be formed to address \nbottlenecks such as conversion time of entitlements and drive \u201cfast fails\u201d.\nIn the past, such process evaluations have helped to improve program \nperformance, implementation rhythm and in mid-term corrective action in a \nphased manner \u2013 that is, learnings from one phase helping in next phase activities. \nWe strongly believe this adaptability in program strategies and ground operations \nhas been the key in the success of our interventions with highly dynamic \ncommunities such as migrants. \nThe systemic changes will be evaluated based on comparative analysis of the \ngovernment database / reports with our Social registry and analytics and third-\nparty evaluations to map relevance, effectiveness, efficacy, impact and \nsustainability, in reducing exploitation and socio-economic vulnerability of migrant \nfamilies and facilitation of safe migration.", "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11. Future Plans\nHow will the grant influence the organisation and future plans? (maximum \n300 words):\nThe MRC has brought together components to contribute to nation-wide system \nchanges.  The MRC envisions a deep level of engagement with all key stakeholders \n\u2013 communities, industry and government, enabling depth of experience and \nlearnings. We believe that assets (e.g., industry assessment tools, research \nproducts), learnings (e.g., from pilots and scaling of interventions), and networks \n(e.g., of companies partnering with the MRC, some of whom will have global \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201317\npresence) developed through the course of the project by the MRC and its \npartners have significant potential for sharing, translation, & potentially \nreplication to other geographies.\nCurrently, from Oak Foundation we are seeking a contribution for interventions in \nthe West Bengal, Mumbai and Delhi Corridor for over 3 years. This contribution \nwould make Oak Foundation one of the joint largest funders of the MRC. The MRC \nconsiders the Oak Foundation as a key funder due to its specific commitment \ntowards migrant communities and driving systems change in the sector. As the \nduration of the MRC is over 5 years, we intend to allocate the remaining funding \nfrom funds already raised from donors like Omidyar Network and Michael & Susan \nDell Foundation (MSDF) and additional fundraising. \nBeyond 5 years, our target for sustainability and scale is adoption by the \ngovernment boards (such as BOCW) and the private sector. Thus, moving away \nfrom the need for further philanthropic funding and towards 80% adoption by the \nprivate companies. We believe that large companies will see financial and \nreputational benefits of facilitating social security entitlements for their workers \nand will be willing to cover the costs of delivery. \nAs a part of the consortium, we have multiple donors (MSDF, Godrej, Omidyar \nNetwork, H.T.

(300 words)\nCPF was established in the backdrop of realising the goal of forest dependent \ncommunities in the management of forest resources as per the National Forest \nPolicy 1988. CPF got registered in August 2002. The organisation has \nmandated to work on other natural resources as part of the landscapes and \necosystems in which forests are a part.\nCPF worked with Government and civil society organization in promoting the \nJoint Forest Management, and later the Community Forest Management \nOak Application Form     6\nprograms. It worked with 680 Vanasamrakshana Samithis in 32 Forest Ranges \nwith 32 NGO partners. They were spread over 12 districts in the three regions \nof undivided Andhra Pradesh, representing 80,800 households and protecting \nover 1,00,000 (one lakh) hectares of forest.\nCPF understood that forest-based livelihoods alone not sufficient for \nenhancing the incomes and conserving the natural resources. It was also \nrealized that tribal communities were unable to access basic services and \nsocial security schemes because of remoteness and apathy of officials. This led \nCPF to work with communities and government on entitlements and \nsustainable NRM based livelihoods through community-based institutions.\nKey Achievements\nI.      Agro-Ecologcial Practices and Water resource development\n\u20224065 farmers following agroecological practices in an extent of 3000 \nacres\n\u2022Promotion of horticulture plantations among 500 farmers in 500 acres\n\u202216569 acres of land was treated with land under cultivation increasing \nby 11% and ground water availability by 66%\nII.

What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? \nHow will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and \ndecide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nAlienation of tribals from the forest has dwindled their livelihoods, food \nsecurity and increased poverty. It reduced their involvement in sustainable \nforest management and harvesting practices of NTFP.  This led to adverse \nimpact on conservation of forest eco-system. Lack of awareness and skills to \nhave constructive and collaborative engagement with government reduced \naccess to avail rights and entitlements.\nOver two decades, CPF worked with indigenous and other resource poor \ncommunities in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha. The organization \nfacilitated the communities to access rights on forest resources and supported \nOak Application Form     7\nthem in sustainable natural resource management through promoting \ncommunity institutions. This enabled them to reap the collective advantages \nof sustainable extraction and value addition of NTFP, participatory natural \nresource management and access entitlements from government.\nCPF undertakes works that aligns with its vision. Before planning any \nintervention, action research is undertaken to analyze and identify the change \nand roles to be played by CPF and other stakeholders. The intervention is \nplanned in a collaborative approach with defined objectives and outcomes \ninvolving community in planning, implementing and monitoring, enabling \nthem towards sustainability.\nCPF strategically works with government to build rapport between \ncommunities and concerned departments for leveraging funds for community \nneeds. It appraises them about its work for possible replication.\nCPF strives to ensure equity and equality in its functioning with women \nplaying equal role in all its interventions. It facilitates in building their \ncapacities, gain access and ownership over resources and become decision-\nmakers.\nA scoping study was conducted in West Bengal, while interacting with relevant \nstakeholders to comprehend the prevailing policies, programs and their \nimplementation in proposed project locations.\nBased on the observations from the scoping study, CPF proposes to work in \nRanibandh block, Bankura district of West Bengal because of its dense forest \nand high tribal population (Savara-PVTG, Santhal, Munda, Singh Sardar etc) \nwith 47.1 % (Census, 2011). The main source of livelihood is agriculture, \nlivestock and NTFP and majority are small and marginal farmers depending \non rain fed agriculture. Though the district receives around 1400 mm rainfall, \nyet cultivation of crop primarily depends on constricted period of erratic \nrainfall. Due to lack of proper water harvesting structures, water percolation \nto the ground is minimal and irrigation facility is low. The farmers are \npredominantly into mono crop cultivation i.e., paddy. The farming practices \nare inorganic leading to high input cost and negative environmental impacts.\nThe Sundarban estuary with mangrove forest is inhabited by the resource poor \nand vulnerable communities. Owing to historical reasons coupled with climatic \nextremities and natural calamities, it remains one of the extremely \nunderdeveloped places with 34 % below poverty line. Livelihood depends on \nagriculture (24.37%), un-organized labour (36.35%), house hold industries \n(4.86%) and others (34.42%) including fishery, forest resource collection [1]. \nThe inhabitants of the region are also extremely vulnerable in various physical \nand socio-economic indicators.\nIn Sunderban, CPF propose to work on enhancing access of entitlements to \ncommunities in Sandeshkhali-I Block of North 24 Parganas District due to the \nhigh social vulnerability of the region with 25.95% of the population belonging \nto ST and 30.90% belonging to SC communities.\nCPF vision and past experience of working with tribal and resource poor \ncommunities and Oak foundation\u2019s focus areas to support the indigenous \ncommunities in West Bengal will bring in synergy in advancing the rights, \navailing entitlements and livelihood development in the proposed area of \nintervention.\nOak Application Form     8\nOak Foundation funding will be used for facilitating the communities to \nadopt crop diversification through improved agriculture practices, enhance \nlivelihoods and enable the communities to access their rights and \nentitlements.\n[1] Census, 2011, West Bengal State Climate Action Plan, 2021", "6.

OBJECTIVES\nThis is the most important part of your application, as it is your opportunity to explain \nwhat you want to achieve and what will be different because of your work. We \nunderstand that social and environmental change is complex and there are a \nmultitude of factors that contribute to change. We want to understand how you define \nyour role in the overall change you hope to make. You may find it helpful to discuss \nthis with your Oak Programme Officer, and others in your own organisation.   \n7.a. Objectives\nList here up to 3 main objectives for this grant (one sentence per objective). Think of objectives as goals \nthat can be achieved within the lifetime of the grant.  We encourage you to think of objective(s) that are \nambitious but also achievable.  \nOverall objective / Goal\nImproving livelihoods of tribals, resource poor and other vulnerable \ncommunities through promoting sustainable natural resource management \nand enhancing access to entitlements by building linkages with the \nGovernment institutions in 25 forest fringe villages of Ranibandh block of \nBankura district and 12 villages in Sandeshkhali-I block of North 24 Parganas.\nSpecific Objectives\n1. Formation and strengthening the village level institutions/groups while \nensuring women leadership in these institutions\n2. Promoting agro-ecological practices, crop diversification and water \nresource development for food & nutritional security amongst male and \nfemale farmers\n3. Enhancing access to alternative livelihoods among landless, resource \npoor and other forest dependent communities while keeping with special \nemphasis on women farmers\n4. Enabling project communities to access and avail their constitutional \nrights and entitlements\nBackground and Context\nGiven the experience of working in watershed project locations, CPF propose \nto work in the watershed areas in Randibandh block of Bankura district \nOak Application Form     9\ncovering 25 villages of Ranibandh, Barikul and Rautora Gram Panchayats. The \nIntegrated Watershed Management Programme, West Bengal was \nimplemented in the proposed project locations in the year 2011-12 covering a \ntotal geographical area of 8819 ha of which the total treatable area was 5398 \nha. It was observed that the benefits of creation of these watershed structures \ncould not be sustain due to lack of emphasis on improved agriculture \npractices, creation and strengthening of farmers institutions and bringing in \nconvergence of various government schemes for the benefit of tribal and other \nresource poor households.\nThe present project aims to address the above-mentioned gaps. And it would \ndemonstrate how the watershed projects in the forest fringe villages could be \ntaken to the next level to reap the benefits and also sustain the initiatives \nthrough community participation.\nThe Sundarban estuary with mangrove forest is inhabited by the resource poor \nand vulnerable communities, owing to historical reasons coupled with climatic \nextremities and natural calamities. The inhabitants of the region are also \nextremely vulnerable in various physical and socio-economic indicators \nincluding infrastructure, food security, healthcare, education, drinking water \nand sanitation. It was observed that, livelihoods based on natural resources \nalone will not effectively sustain the people of the region. CPF proposes to \nwork on enhancing access to entitlements for communities covering 12 \nvillages of Boyermari-I, Boyermani-II and Hatgachi Gram Panchayats of \nSandeshkhali-I Block of North 24 Parganas District.\nThus, the project has immense potential for scaling up and replication in other \nsocio-economically vulnerable regions of West Bengal.\nCPF\u2019s Role\nThe organization works with community institutions and capacitates them in \nappropriate skills as well as federates them at different levels for reaping \ncollective advantages with regard to accessing their rights on forest resources \nand supports them in sustainable natural resource management including \nforest resources. Sustainable extraction of Non timber forest produce, value \naddition at the community level, participatory resource monitoring, water \nresource development, facilitating agro ecological practices in their lands, and \nhelping them to access entitlements and proper services from the government \ndepartments are some of the activities the organization undertakes, to address \nthe problems of the communities.\nWhile recognizing that women lack decision making and negotiation skills, \nmobility, identity and self -esteem and access to and control over resources \nand assets, CPF focuses on building their leadership through all its \ninterventions.\nPrimary stakeholders are the tribal and resource poor communities who \nmostly belong to the small and marginal farmer category\nSecondary stakeholders are the various government departments, traders and \nother service providers (who are engaged to provide certain services to the \ncommunity).\n1. Formation and strengthening the village level institutions/groups\na. Formation and strengthening of Tribal Farmers Service Centre \n(TFSC)\nOak Application Form     10\nThe Tribal Farmer\u2019s Service Centres will be formed with two representatives \nfrom each small group as committee members. CPF ensures that 50 percent \nare women in these committees with leadership role in the committee. The \ncenters are managed by the committee and they provide services viz., \nKnowledge services, information about government schemes, providing \nagricultural implements on minimum rental basis. The amount collected will \nbe used to sustain the Centre. Major Implements will be purchased with minor \ncontribution from the project farmers.\nb. Formation and strengthening of Village Coordination Groups (VCGs)\nCPF initiated a concept called Village Coordination Groups (VCGs) during the \nyear 2016. In the VCGs, two members from each of the existing CBOs (one \nfemale and one male) are grouped at the habitation level along with Sarpanch \nand one ward member. The purpose is to facilitate to access entitlements to \nall eligible individuals and also seek support for community needs. Awareness \nregarding various new government schemes, policies for tribals including \nForest Rights Act also discussed in the VCGs. VCG meets once in a month and \ndiscusses about the follow-up to be done with regard to the access/petitions \nsubmitted. It not only supports the individual CBOs on issues identified but \nalso discusses about the community level issues and requirements such as \u2013 \nrepair to PHC centre, approach road, drinking water etc.\nAt each of the 37 project habitations VCGs will be formed. Women \nrepresentatives from CBOs will become leaders in the VCGs formed. Thus, \nVCG will contribute in filling the gap between the communities, Panchayats \nand block officials.\nThe VCGs provide services to all eligible households (as per baseline) access \ndifferent government schemes of West Bengal like Khadya Saathi Scheme \n(RKSY-1 & 2), Duara Sarkar (campaign on 18 schemes with delivery at door \nstep) etc., and Community level entitlements.\nActivities\n1. Formation of 25 Tribal Farmer Service Centre (TFSC) and 37 Village \nCoordination Groups\n2. Capacitating Village Institution members on their roles and \nresponsibilities, book keeping, engagement with the government \ndepartments etc.\n3. Awareness building amongst project communities on importance of \nparticipation in Gram Sabhas and other decision-making process of local \ngoverning bodies.\n2. Promoting agro-ecological practices, crop diversification and water \nresource development for food & nutritional security.\nIn 25 project habitations, demonstration plots will be established @ one per \nhabitation. Farmer\u2019s Field schools will be conducted to progressive farmers, \nwho in turn will follow the practices in their fields and also motivate, teach \nand encourage other farmers to practice the methods learnt. In kharif season \nFarmer\u2019s field schools will be conducted 4 times at pre sowing, sowing, during \ncrop period and at harvest time. In the FFS both agro-ecological and crop \nspecific practices will be taught and demonstrated. The main crop in the \nhabitation will be focused.\nOak Application Form     11\n1000 farmers will be reached out and the extent covered will be 500 acres \n(@ 0.5 acre/farmer)\nActivities\n1.

COOPERATION": "8. COOPERATION  \nHow will you involve others in your approach to achieving change? If you are \nplanning to engage in partnerships with other organisations, communities, people with lived \nexperience, academics or secure the support of key individuals, please tell us about this.  \nWhy are these the right partners to engage with?  Is there anything new about how you are \nchoosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you \nusually work? (300 words):\nParticipation and collaboration is central to the way CPF functions. CPF \nfollows a constructive, critical and collaborative approach with Communities \nand CSOs for implementing all its activities and projects. Depending on the \nnature of intervention, CPF had sought / worked with experts, academic \ninstitutions and networks. This has helped in not only realising project goals \nbut also established CPF as a transparent organisation.\nIn West Bengal, CPF had already began its interactions with relevant \nstakeholders including government as it is paramount in the smooth \ngrounding of project interventions. Through the scoping study, Pradan which \nis working in the Bankura district is identified as a possible collaborator for \nlivelihood interventions and discussions were held with their team in this \nregard. Besides this, other CSO representatives were consulted extensively to \nunderstand the relevant issues and the proposal was vetted seeking their \ninputs. Consultations with various stakeholders will be continued.\nOne of the major stakeholders in implementation of the project are the local \ngoverning bodies including the gram panchayats. The project envisions to \nengage gram panchayats at various levels of the project especially in providing \naccess to rights and entitlements to the project communities. The various \ngovernment departments especially the agriculture department, panchayat \nand rural development department will be engaged in leveraging the \ngovernment schemes and programs that aligns with the project objectives. The \nproject will engage with organisations providing research and extension-based \nservices such as Krishi Vignana Kendra (KVK).

The project monitoring system is built on expected outcomes and \nimpact. It assists in tracing the project progress towards achieving the \nobjectives and undertake mid-term corrections as required.\nBefore grounding the project, baseline survey will be undertaken and MIS \ndeveloped accordingly. The monitoring formats are designed as per outcome \nindicators. The project information is collected at regular intervals and \nmaintained. The quality of data collection is ensured by the Project officers in \nthe field and later analyzed by the MIS Officer. This is reviewed in a timely \nmanner by the program team. The analyzed reports are shared with \nstakeholders.\nQualitative indicators are captured and documented through regular \nmonitoring visits by project implementing team and Senior Management \nTeam. Monthly planning and review meetings are held at field office and also \nat Head Office for all the projects. Mid-term and end term evaluation of the \nprojects are being done as per the donor requirement and also keeping in view \nlong term vision of the organization.\nLearning: \nOver two decades, while implementing the projects, it was understood that \nforest-based livelihoods alone are not sufficient for enhancing incomes and \nconserving natural resources. CPF moved towards promoting agro-ecological \npractices, horticulture and water resource development. Tribal communities \nwere unable to access basic services and social security schemes because of \nremoteness and apathy of officials. This led CPF to work with communities and \nthe government on entitlements and sustainable NRM based livelihoods \nthrough community-based institutions.\nThrough this grant opportunity from the Oak Foundation to work in the regions \nof physical and socio-economic vulnerabilities of West Bengal, CPF is hoping \nto establish that its approach of enhancing income, access to entitlements and \npromoting agro-ecological practices though community-based institutions in \nforest fringe villages can be replicated.  \nOak Application Form     15", "10.

Are you planning a direct baseline commissioned by CPF or \nwould it be established through existing secondary data?\n \nQuestions raised by Trustee, President and Director-India Programme\nWhat were the factors that led to the collapse of the networks that \nexisted in West Bengal 5-6 years ago?\nWest Bengal has not been identified as a tribal state with the tribal population \nof about 5% of the total population. NGOs who are working with tribals are \nfocusing on health, education and livelihoods in a welfare approach rather than \nrights approach. In Sundarbans area the government is focusing on \ndevelopment based on tourism and environment.

This approach helps CPF in realizing the project goals and also \nestablishes CPF as a transparent organization ensuring the CSOs engage with \nCPF to achieve the common goals by sharing the collective as well as the \nspecialized capacities of all involved stakeholders.\nCPF worked with 52 NGOs and Vanasmakhya - network of 680 Vana \nSamrakshana Samitis while facilitating Joint Forest Management and \nCommunity Forest Management in undivided Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.\nCPF would network with organization working for tribals and their \nentitlements in West Bengal also with the vast experience it has gained over \nthe years.\nWhy does CPF wish to work in West Bengal; how well is CPF placed in \nterms of connections with key departments, peers, staffing etc.? What \nare some of the factors you consider key for CPF to successfully \nestablish the work in West Bengal?\nCPF has been aiming to work towards restoration of the forest ecosystem in \nthe Eastern Ghats[1]. In the process, organization is expanding its \noperational areas and CPF chose to work in West Bengal for the same \nreason. Because of CPF work earlier with Forest Department, we could easily \nestablish contacts with the Forest Department and also with other \ndepartments in West Bengal.\nWhile doing the scoping study, CPF contacted IBRAD, PRADAN, CRY, Oxfam \u2013 \nIndia, CINI, EKJUT, WWF, and researchers working in West Bengal to \nunderstand the tribal livelihoods and also the civil society and government \nengagement on entitlements.\nCPF has well experienced team to ground a project of this scale and nature in \nother states and who can mentor the new recruits and provide necessary hand \nholding support to them.

(300 words)\nMission:\nAangan strengthens child protection systems to ensure vulnerable children \nare supported to stay in school, protected from trafficking, child marriage, \nhazardous work, violence, and exploitation. Our 5-year goal is to make \nchildren\u2019s safety a crosscutting issue across sectors.\n \nHistory:\n2002-2013: Working with child survivors in state-run rescue homes (CCIs). \nUsing a first of its kind Monitoring Tool co-created with UNICEF India we \naudited CCIs across 16 states to provide strategic inputs on improving \nstandards of care.  Here we understood the importance of preventing harm at \nthe source and started shifting focus accordingly.\n2009-2015: Understanding that vulnerable children came from vulnerable \nfamilies and communities, we initiated community-based programs for \nchildren, working with families and local authorities, starting in Mumbai and \nexpanding across Maharashtra, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal, and Uttar \nPradesh.\n2015-2017: This culminated in PACT Parents and Children against \nTrafficking/Harm ) program that trained community women and leveraged \ntheir knowledge to prevent child harm in their communities with a 360-degree \nview of child safety.\n2018-2022: Building on PACT \u2013 Hotspot to Safe-spot was a district-wide \ndemonstration model in 5 districts (Rajasthan, Bengal, Jharkhand, UP, Bihar), \nbringing community women volunteers and key authorities (police, education, \nurban administration) together to create regular dialogue platforms focused \non child safety. These resulted in strategies like regular community safety \naudits shared with police; a family follow-up system for irregular/absent school \nchildren; maintaining migrating family registers with GPs.\n \nAchievements:\n\u2022Successful Advocacy with Government:\noThe state-wide Suraksha Sakhi scheme launched by Rajasthan Police in \n2021, is an expansion of Aangan's child-oriented community policing \nmodel demonstrated in Bharatpur.\n\u2022Child Safety through the HotSpot to Safespot Model\n\u2022Community volunteers across 5 districts gathered hyperlocal child harm \nand risk data that informed targeted interventions implemented with \nauthorities that led to ~19K school re-enrolments and averting ~1,600 \nchild marriages\nOak Application Form     7\n5c. What is the problem you want to address and what is your approach? \nHow will you use Oak's funding? How did you identify the problem and \ndecide your approach? If you have undertaken a theory of change exercise, or if \nyou are influenced by research, policy or your own organisation\u2019s experience, please \ntell us about this.  Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nGlobal evidence suggests that vulnerable groups such as children are at \nheightened risk of being exploited in the aftermath of climate disasters. \nAccording to ILO, 70 million children are impacted by climate disasters \nglobally every year.[1] Losses incurred during disasters often push families \ntowards dangerous adaptive strategies - migration, taking children out of \nschool, marrying them off, sending them to work, etc. These survival \nmeasures, along with the impact of disaster itself profoundly impacts a \nchild's life, exposing her to a plethora of immediate and long-term risks. \nMoreover, if the frequency of disasters is high, the cycle of risks \nperpetuates. \n \nWest Bengal, with a history of climate vulnerability and 15 districts \nsusceptible to extreme climate events, has witnessed multiple risk cycles. \nThe issue that was alarming to begin with has been exacerbated owing to \nrapid climate change. Since 2019, Bengal has faced three major tropical \ncyclones - Bulbul, Amphan and Yaas.\n \nAangan has worked in N 24 Parganas since 2017, demonstrating a \ncommunity-based child harm prevention model to address child trafficking, \nchild marriage and child labour, issues already established as endemic to the \narea. We work closely with community women volunteer groups who gather \nhyperlocal data and information and work with stakeholders and families on \nfinding solutions. We are therefore privy to how child harm and risks are \nexacerbated manifold because of the frequent recurrence of serious climate \nevents in this region and have also worked with community groups towards \nsolutions. Our experience shows:\n \nMedium to Long-term aftermath of disasters on families and children:\noDegradation and salinity of agricultural land and coastal erosion has \nforced changes in livelihood and sustenance patterns and loss of \nlivelihood leading to migration (sometimes leaving children behind) \nand increased child labour: In a joint initiative with GPs, 14744 families \nwere identified by community groups as being forced to migrate for \nwork and were provided with key information about safe practices\noChildren dropping out of school and a change in perception of the \nrelevance of education: 7972 children at risk of dropping out were \nsupported with remedial classes and re-enrolled in school\nOak Application Form     8\noIncreased child marriages: community groups prevented 429 child \nmarriages\noChild labour \u2013 children are entering the work force younger and are \nalso in hazardous work: 10698 children in or at risk of child labour \npulled out of child labour and linked back to school\noAnecdotal data from community women and from children (particularly \ngirls) points to an increase in trafficking in the guise of offers for \nmarriage and work\noIncrease in the number of child-headed families: 589 child-headed \nfamilies were identified and brought under the supervision of \ncommunity groups\n \nState governments set operational priorities during disaster response which \ndetermine the allocation of resources and response strategies for the whole \nstate. Within this its particularly important for the approach at the district-\nlevel to be sensitive to the needs of children.  Unfortunately, this is not the \ncase.\n \nState and district-level disaster management plans in Bengal don\u2019t say much \nabout children. In S24 Parganas plans there is mention of a need for \npsychological support to vulnerable groups including children, and the N24 \nParganas plans briefly mention children as a group in reference to disaster \nawareness and preparedness drives at schools (pre-disaster) and food and \nclothing requirement at the relief camps (post-disaster). Child and women's \nsafety are briefly referred to under Law and Order Safety Measures. \n \nOur experience shows its urgent that child protection work be embedded \ninside resilience building and risk reduction as a part of addressing climate \nchange. This is the gap we seek to address\n \n[1] https://www.ilo.org/manila/public/pr/WCMS_558093/lang--en/index.htm", "6. PLACE HOLDER": "6. PLACE HOLDER", "7. OBJECTIVES": "7.

We encourage you to be \nopen to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your \noutcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? \n(300 words):\n1. The Occurrence of Serious Climate Events: this is always a possibility \nas this is an extremely high-risk region. As our experience shows, this \nchanges or at least delays project plans as the work on the ground \nnecessarily shifts focus to crisis management. Year 1 needs community \nengagement which is not at all feasible should such an issue arise. The tragic \nflip side is of course that one gets to build evidence- it just may not be with \ncommunity involvement.\n \n2. Community Push-back: Many child harms that occur are a result of \nsurvival strategies families adopt \u2013 for example child labor, or leaving \nchildren without appropriate care due to migration. Communities are more \nable to have these honest conversations when real alternatives exist. \nSometimes these are possible through linkage to state support, schemes and \nprograms \u2013 these are strategies that we have used in the past and will use \nagain. They require government cooperation too- which can also be tricky to \nnegotiate, especially if it is not an area of the government\u2019s focus.\n \n3. Lack of Interest from State/District: The State\u2019s buy-in will depend on \nhow relevant the issue of child protection is for them, especially true for \n2023-24 in the run-up to the general election. This will also impact what they \nprioritize in the district with regard to schemes and services. Availability of \npanchayats and local officials may also be affected. Building a ground-up \ndemand for child safety is all the more important.\nOak Application Form     16\n \n4. Initiating Work in a New District: we will be initiating work in S. 24 \nParganas where we don\u2019t have relationships.

Since inception DISHA has been active on different issues concerning \nenvironment, environmental health and human rights.\nSince 2000 DISHA has been involved in protection of coastal environment on \nthe issues of beach protection, destruction of fish resources, protection of \nmarine bio-diversity, unscrupulous tourism, unsafe industrialization, etc. \nDISHA started working with the traditional small scale fishing \ncommunitieswho are the natural custodians of coasts and protect \nenvironment for their livelihood through sustainable fishing. Three key \nachievements in fisheries sector -\n\u2022Since 2003 DISHA became involved in protection of bio-diversity in \nSundarban and livelihood of the fisher people who depend upon forest \nresources since ages. Later the issue of implementation of Forest Rights \nAct was taken up. DISHA conducted a study in 2009 on the Livelihood \nProblems of Traditional Fishers in Protected Area \n(www.dishaearth.org). Since 2012, DISHA became involved with inland \nfisheries. Policy issues like tenure rights of the small fishers, protection \nof their livelihood, saving the water bodies were taken up. DISHA started \nadvocating for policies at both national and state level in favour of small-\nscale fishers for sustainable use of fisheries resources.\nOak Application Form     7\n\u2022At the ground level DISHA had been engaged in organising and \nsupporting fish workers\u2019 collectives in nine southern districts of West \nBengal viz., Dakshin 24 Parganas, Uttar 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly \nand Purba Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, Jhargram, Nadia, \nMurshidabad. In North Bengal DISHA is engaged in supporting \ncollectivization of small-scale fish workers in 5 districts - Malda, Uttar \nDinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Coochbehar and Alipurduar. DISHA has also been \ninstrumental in formation of a national platform of small scale fish \nworkers\u2019 organisations in 20 states and UTs.\n\u2022DISHA has been supporting the small-scale fish workers campaign on \nright to water and natural resources, campaigns and legal intervention \nto stop pollution in a trans-boundary river Mathabhanga, caused by a \ndistillery in Bangladesh, cleaning of Churni and Ichamati rivers in Nadia, \nrejuvenation of Buriganga river in Nadia and Bidyadhari river in Dakshin \n24 Parganas, campaigns against use of mosquito net in rivers and water \nbodies of Murshidabad and Jalpaiguri, campaigns on several tenure \nrights issues like fish workers\u2019 occupational identity card, credit cards, \nprovision of implements, accident insurance, boat registration etc.\n5c.

Even though \nyou may have many achievements, please share what is most relevant to the \nproposed grant. (300 words)\nKABIL was incorporated at the end of 2012 and started its operations in early \n2014. During the first four years, KABIL provided on-site project \nimplementation support to other organisations for livelihood enhancement of \nthe rural poor. Concentrating in North-east India, it provided such support to \nother NGOs and the NERLP (World Bank funded).  It also trained all the \nfrontline functionaries of the Government of Jharkhand on livelihood \npromotion through natural resource management (NRM). KABIL currently \nworks with the Assam State Rural Livelihoods Mission, Government of Assam \n(ASRLM) to promote climate-resilient livelihoods for members of women\u2019s self-\nhelp groups in Udalguri district of Assam. It works in Tikamgarh of Madhya \nPradesh to develop water resources for livelihood promotion. It also works \nwith NGOs in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan to harness \nMahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) for \ndurable individual asset creation.\nSome salient achievements include:\n1. Popularising micro-irrigation pumps among smallholders in rural \nKamrup of Assam\n2. Facilitating as many as 702 individual livelihood assets in the form of \nfarm ponds and pigsties harnessing INR 8.58 Crore (USD 1.13 million) \nfrom the MGNREGS for an equal number of rural beneficiaries in a \nOak Application Form     7\nsingle community development block (Udalguri) over 4 years (2018-22). \nIn this project, as per a recent sample survey, out of the 1920 households \nwith whom at least three livelihood interventions were made, 59% \nincreased their annual income between 1 lakh and 1.49 lakh because of \nproject interventions.\n3. There is more demand now for KABIL from the Government. The ASRLM \nhas invited KABIL to provide design and implementation support for \ntheir Integrated Farming Cluster Programme, The District \nAdministration of Udalguri has asked KABIL to expand its activities to \ndifferent blocks and the District Administration of Tikamgarh (Madhya \nPradesh) has invited KABIL to become their technical support agency.\n5c.

Have you consulted with relevant stakeholders, including your \ncommunities and others experiencing the problem? Is there an intention to address \nequity, diversity and inclusion? (600 words):\nWe want to address the problem of livelihood and income vulnerability of tea \ngarden families in the closed and sick tea gardens of West Bengal. The \nmajority of the tea garden workers are Adivasis (Scheduled Tribes) who are \nsocially at the margins too. while the condition of workers across tea gardens \nis far from satisfactory, the vulnerability is acute in the closed and sick tea \ngardens.\nThe problem was identified through our understanding of poverty pockets in \nWest Bengal and two exploratory visits by us to the proposed project area. We \ndiscussed the problems and issues with the communities, government officials, \nelected representatives of the local self-government institutions and leaders \nof the tea garden workers. Secondary information, research etc. were also \nconsulted. For example, Sengupta, Naskar and Datta (March 2021) describe \nthe historical context of the current condition of the tea workers. Bera (2014) \ndescribes the poverty in the particular areas we visited and the more than \n1000 reported starvation deaths since 2002. Ansari and Sheereen  (2016) \ndescribe the vulnerability of tea workers when a tea garden is locked out or \nthe work is temporarily suspended.\nOur first-hand information indicates the following:\nMost of those who are still employed work as temporary workers. The most \nthey can expect is 132 days of work in a year at Rs 202 per day. The rest is \nearned through other casual means. Migration is common. Except for those \nwho migrate to places like Kerala or find occasional work through MGNREGS, \nthe wages earned are always less than tea garden wages. Finding menial jobs \nin the nearby towns is another commonly used means. Facilitated by labour \ncontractors, younger women and men, many of them school dropouts, travel \nlong distances regularly to functioning tea gardens and other places to do \nwage work. Labour contractors take their commission from these wage \nearners. There is a significant transport cost and time involved in travel. Jobs \navailable in other tea gardens are the ones which the local workers of the tea \nOak Application Form     8\ngarden would not prefer. Collecting stones and boulders from the nearby \nriverbanks and selling them to middlemen is a common occupation. Stone and \nboulder collection is a hard job and can at best earn Rs 150 (USD 2) a day. \nFarming and animal husbandry in the homesteads supplement income. All \nthese together can earn a family Rs 50,000 on average.  \nThe government is using MGNREGS to provide wages to tea garden families. \nThere is also a \u201cFoula\u201d system in the closed tea gardens through which the \nState Government pays Rs 1,500 (USD 20) per month to only the erstwhile \npermanent workers till they attain the age of 58.\nMany of the dwelling units of the tea garden families, which were built by the \ntea garden management decades back, are in dilapidated condition in the \nabsence of repair. Electricity and water, which were earlier provided by the \ntea garden are no longer available from them in the closed tea gardens. In the \nsick ones, the services often get interrupted because of payment and other \nissues. In closed tea gardens like Surendranagar and Redbank, the tea \nplantation area has turned into jungles. This has increased the menace of \nelephants.\nThrough this project, we specifically attempt to enhance the income equity of \nthe tribal and other vulnerable populations in the tea gardens who remain at \nthe margins. We also attempt to foster gender equality and inclusion of women \nby working predominantly with women and their groups which enhances their \ndecision-making space and leadership.", "6.

Is there anything new about how you are \nchoosing to work - for example, new partnerships or an approach that is different to how you \nusually work? (300 words):\nOak Application Form     11\nThe project is by its very nature a collaborative one. Outcomes cannot be \nachieved without the involvement of stakeholders. As we explored the area, \nwe introduced ourselves and discussed the problems and issues with the \ngovernment functionaries, the elected representatives of the local self-\ngovernment institutions, and leaders of the tea workers\u2019 trade unions. As a \nresult, we were introduced to the communities by the government \nfunctionaries working in the respective blocks.\nAs we venture into the project, we would also explore collaboration with \npartners of Oak Foundation. We understand that some of them operate in the \narea or are planning to operate. In addition to gaining insights from them, we \nalso expect great complementarity and further energizing of the initiatives of \nall the concerned partners.\nA collaboration with West Bengal State Rural Livelihood Mission will be much \nsought after because the women\u2019s SHGs promoted by them are expected to be \nan important platform for action. KABIL is already working with the State \nRural Livelihood Mission in the adjoining state of Assam and has gained \nexperience in collaboration with such an entity.\nFinancial institutions like banks and market actors will have to be tapped. \nCommunities need access to credit for their livelihood initiatives; they also \nrequire input and output linkages with the market. Relevant industry bodies \nlike the India Tea Association will be consulted on issues and their cooperation \nwill be sought.\nLast but not least, we do realise that the situation in the tea gardens is complex \nand more insight is needed. There are many academics and there is a wealth \nof research on issues in tea gardens. It will be our constant endeavour to seek \ninput from academics and available knowledge.", "9.

The most important area of learning for us will be how to work in tea \ngardens and the tea garden community benefit from the development of land \nthat does not belong to them.  This is a new area for KABIL and this grant \nallows the testing of this assumption.", "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.  RISKS AND CHALLENGES\nWhat are the risks or barriers that might prevent you from achieving your \noutcomes and how will you address these?  What are your opportunities?\nWe understand that achieving long-lasting and meaningful change is hard and we \nexpect that the work you want to do will mean taking risks.  We encourage you to be \nopen to telling us these, as well as how you will address these risks.  If some of your \noutcomes are risky, are there any incremental achievements that you could identify? \n(300 words):\nThe risks are as under:\na. The closed tea gardens have no current owners. So no consultation with \nthe owners is possible for the activities on tea garden lands. If and when \nnew owners are found by the government, they may not allow cultivation \nactivities on those lands. We understand that finding owners for these \ntea gardens is difficult because of the deteriorated plantations and \nseveral pending court cases. Nevertheless, the project will remain in \ntouch with the government so that any new negotiation accommodates \nthe changed reality of the gardens. \nb. Elections in the local self-government institutions (PRIs) are due in May \n2023. Any change in political composition thereafter can impede the \nOak Application Form     13\nrelationship. To circumvent this, the project will make its apolitical \nstance explicit before all stakeholders.\nc. Allocation under MGNREGS may be reduced by the central/state \ngovernments which will adversely affect fund leverage. In such a \nscenario, the project will have to tap other schemes and sources to \ncompensate for the reduction.\nd. The women\u2019s SHGs formed by the Livelihood Mission may not be in a \ngood shape to work with. In an extreme scenario, the Mission may not \nallow the project access to the SHGs. While we have a prima facie \nassurance from the local government functionaries that the project can \nwork with the SHGs, it may have to put in additional effort to first \nstrengthen the SHGs to work with them.\nThe opportunities include a) a huge area of uncultivated lands which can be \nutilized for cultivation purposes, b) the government\u2019s concern about the \nwellbeing of the workers of the closed tea gardens c) Good road connectivity \nd) high rainfall in the area that creates a high potential for water harvesting \ne) Tea (Promotion and Development) bill 2022 which aims at improving the \ntea industry, etc.", "11.

DRCSC is committed to develop \nclimate adaptive technologies which can be accepted and easily managed by the \nlocal communities. The organisation encourages handing over of the \nadministrative responsibilities to user groups or their representatives in a phased \nmanner. Its vision is to work for a sustainable future for the rural poor and \nmarginalized communities so that\nthey can break the shackles of poverty and hunger and capacitate them to act \nagainst environmental degradation.

Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nDRCSC focuses on working with marginal community who are most vulnerable and \nresource poor and live in ecologically fragile zones. It works with the entire \nhousehold with main focus on women. It ensures equal participation, providing \nbest opportunity to learn, dream and fulfil their dream through promotion of low \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\ncost sustainable NRM models and convergences with different government \nschemes and services.\nDRCSC\u2019s currents areas of involvement is as follows :\n1. To build capacities of vulnerable communities and encourage them to get \ninvolved in participatory action research (that are environment friendly, \neconomically feasible, socially equitable & viable) to develop climate change \nadaptive models in agriculture and allied sectors in the ecologically fragile \nzones.\n2. To increase and sustain income opportunities of the ultra-poor families \nthrough diversification of the sources of income with focus to farm and non-\nfarm initiatives.\n3. To assess the possibilities of resources available in different agro climatic \nregion and build capacities of the adolescents and youth through short term \ncourses on natural resource based vocations so that they can process such \nresources and develop small enterprises either individually or collectively or \nearn livelihood as instructors.\n4. To support small and marginal farmers engaged in producing organic \nproducts to establish backward and forward linkages in marketing. \n5. Consolidate our identity as a Resource Organisation for ecological agriculture \nand extend capacity building services at all levels like farmers, field workers, \norganisers, individuals and organisations interested to promote organic \nfarming in South and South East Asia.\n6.

What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nThe Sundarbans\u2019 ecosystem is one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems of \nthe Indian Sub-continent. The UNESCO designated world heritage site plays a key \nrole as the region\u2019s carbon sink soaking in around 4.15 crore tonnes of carbon \ndioxide (2011). However, the region\u2019s rich bio-diversity and burgeoning human \npopulation stand at a brink today with increasing threats to their very existence \nfrom exogenous climate induced shocks and its aftereffects.\n \nThe principal land-based livelihoods get impacted due to increased salinity, lack of \nknowledge with regard to sustainable agriculture, no options for diversified \nagriculture etc. due to which more and more people are exploiting the natural \nresource base in a manner that will be difficult to sustain over the long run. \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\nFrequent climatic hazards (saline flood, cyclone etc) are disrupting the livelihood \nover and above. Agricultural lands are being converted into prawn farming ponds \n(Bheri) which is again not sustained livelihood option at all.\n \nThe proposed interventions will be emphasized on orientation on different \ntechniques and methods of climate adaptive agriculture, livestock farming, \naquaculture, and other on-farm and non-farm income generation programmes \nwhich ultimately will help the community to diversify their income opportunities \nand thereby will lead to increase climate resilience. The interventions will consist \nof establishing seed banks through which the targeted households will be able to \nconserve salt-tolerant seeds for future, they will be able to learn to prepare \nnutrition gardens at each and every possible space they have around their \nhomestead to get assured nutrition with their daily meals round the year. The \nbiggest problem of Sundarbans, river bank erosion will be tried to be addressed \nthrough plantation of mangroves and protecting those plants to reduce the \nproblem. Rain water will be harvested through different rain water harvesting \nstructures which may help in increasing the availability of irrigation during the \nstress period.

Summarise the project\u2019s ultimate goal(s) (maximum 200 words):\n( NOT REQUIRED FOR CORE SUPPORT GRANTS)\nThe Project\u2019s ultimate goal is to \u201cReduce Socio economic vulnerability, \nimprove livelihoods and resilience of 9,000 Tea worker communities in 5 \ndistricts of North Bengal and Assam namely- Jalpaiguri, Kalimpong, Darjeeling, \nin North Bengal and Sonitpur, Biswanath in Assam . The work will be undertaken \nacross 35 gardens of which 25 gardens in North Bengal and 10 gardens in Assam.\n \nTea worker communities constitute one of the most isolated and marginalised \ncommunities amongst various plantation workers. Having been uprooted from \ntheir native places, their lives across generations have remained confined to \ngardens with limited interaction with outside communities. Being under the sole \nauthority of respective garden management, the workers have little security and \nsafety nets other than those provided by Garden management, long working hours, \nlack of work security, low literacy and low skill sets have made this segment of \npopulation particularly marginalised, Further, this affects women and youth the \nmost in terms of poor health conditions of women, malnutrition amongst the \npopulation, disenchantment amongst youth. Most often young boys and girls, out of \nsheer desperation take risks of uninformed migration, falling victims to trafficking \nand other forms of abuse.\n \nThe project will be the first phase of a multi-phase intervention where the project \nwill facilitate building of community voices and create opportunities and choices \nfor Tea worker households. We have limited our intervention specifically to cover \nTea workers and to some extent workers in Small Tea Gardens who are relatives of \nworkers in Large and Closed Tea gardens. Small Tea Growers are not covered \nwithin the ambit of the current phase given their varied profile and more \nmainstream identity compared to workers in Tea estates who are covered under \nPlantation Labour Act. In this phase the primary focus will be to improve \nlivelihoods and safety nets through a participatory process of needs, resources, \nskills and opportunity identification leading to diversification and improvement in \nincomes. Secondly, collectivisation of women and youth in the gardens and \nenhancing their knowledge, skills and sense of agency will improve their \nnegotiation and dialogue capacities with officials within and outside the gardens \nenabling them to access entitlements from the Government. We see this as a \ncritical intervention towards Trade justice \u2013 which depends a lot of building \ncapacities of the community itself to identify and raise their issues and stand up for \ntheir own rights The project will also establish a model of climate adaptive \npractices through establishing small scale innovations in two Gardens and \nfacilitate formation of informal CSO group for peer to peer learning, broadbased \nunderstanding of Labour Code and its dissemination, joint assessment of advocacy \nissues and actions for policy.", "4.

ORGANISATION CONTEXT": "6. Context (The context section should not exceed two pages.)\n6a. Describe the organisation (include information on leadership, \ngovernance, structure and staff) and expected changes. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nTraidcraft Exchange is an international development organization with an annual \nincome of about \u00a33m and is registered as a charity with the Charity Commission \nand a Company Limited by Guarantee.\nThrough local offices in East Africa and South Asia, Traidcraft Exchange has \nimpacted the lives of over 500,000 people through a variety of initiatives with \nsmall scale farmers and producers, focusing largely on sustainable agricultural \npractices, value chain development and access to fairer market linkages. \nTraidcraft Exchange has worked across India and has supported Tribal and \nvulnerable communities in Odisha, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam and \nthe North Eastern States.\nThe Board of Traidcraft Exchange consists of seven non-executive directors, \ntogether with the Chief Executive, that meets about 7 times a year. All Directors \nare subject to re-election every three years, except the foundation Director (who is \nappointed by the Traidcraft Foundation. The board appoints the Chief Executive \nwho manages the day to day operations of the charity. We have women Board \nMembers and most members of our Senior Management Team (SMT) are women, \nincluding a woman CEO. The SMT meets regularly to monitor progress on our \nAnnual Plan and support the operations of the organization.\nThe number of full-time equivalent employees are 47 in Traidcraft Exchange \nacross five offices in the UK, South Asia and East Africa. There are approximately \n14 full-time equivalent staff employed in the headquarter office in Newcastle; 10 \npeople in the London office; 5 in the East Africa office in Kenya; 12 in the \nBangladesh office, and 6 in the India office. We have expertise and experience in \ntrade and market access, supporting women\u2019s economic empowerment and \nenvironmental sustainability in supply chains. With the recent strategic review \nprocess of Traidcraft and need for reorganising, the staff position might change in \nnear future. \n6b. Describe the financial situation (include information on annual \noperating costs, fundraising strategy, reserves and debts) and expected \nchanges. (maximum 300 words):\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20136\nAs of 2019/20 Traidcraft Exchange had overall unrestricted reserves of \u00a3819k. We \nare expecting to at least break even at an operating level in 2020/21 and our \nbudget for 2021/22 shows operating costs of \u00a32.096m with income of circa \n\u00a32.14m. We currently have no long-term liabilities on our balance sheet and little \ncurrent debt.\n \nWe are currently going through a restructure, which is focusing on the \norganisation as a whole in order to cut costs but also to make us more efficient in \nraising funds from our existing donor base, including individual donors, trusts and \nfoundations and other philanthropists.\nIn terms of fundraising, we were quick to adapt to the Covid crisis and \nunrestricted fundraising efforts have weathered Covid restrictions well as the \ncharity has a fairly large, loyal donor base who have continued to give \nphilanthropically throughout the lockdown periods.\nOur public fundraising strategy seeks to focus resources on high return on \ninvestment, philanthropic activity such as appeals, regular giving and legacy. With \nregards our restricted funding strategy we currently operate an institutional \nfunding model whereby we seek funding from institutions such as Comic Relief, \nNational Lottery Community Fund, the UK government and the EU to fund \nprojects designed and delivered by Traidcraft Exchange in collaboration with local \npartners. However, the NGO and INGO funding landscape is shifting. We are \nseeking to adapt our current funding model in light of this and beginning in the \nnext financial year we will start to seek funding from a much broader range of \nfunders.\n6c. Describe the history and past achievements of the organisation. \n(maximum 300 words):\nTraidcraft Exchange (TX) was set up in 1986 by Traidcraft plc (established in \n1979) to provide an alternate route to trade where people are at the heart of trade. \nThrough its development programmes in South Asia and East Africa, and the \npolicy, lobbying & campaigning work in the UK/EU, Traidcraft has made a \ndifference to the lives of millions of people. Key achievements include:\n\u2022We have supported 500,000 producers across Asia and Africa to improve \nproductivity, market access, particularly for vulnerable communities like \nwomen, ethnic minorities, youth and people with disability.\n\u2022We have set-up and promoted like-minded organisations including Shared \nInterest and Caf\u00e9 Direct.\n\u2022We have sourced over 1000 products from 30 countries across Asia, Africa \nand Latin America.\n\u2022We have pioneered at least 5 new Fairtrade certified products into the \nglobal Fairtrade system while supporting the Fairtrade Labelling \nOrganisation to develop and test product standards.\n\u2022We have demonstrated transparent operations through social accounting \nand publication of these reports.\n\u2022We were voted one of the most innovative charities in the UK; also receiving \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20137\nawards on our policy & campaigning and public fundraising initiatives.\n\u2022TX\u2019s policy work led to the introduction of a supermarket ombudsman and \nGroceries Adjudicator to ensure adherence to a supply code of practice to \nbenefit workers. Traidcraft has policy expertise on purchasing practices, \ncorporate governance and accountability, fair and ethical trade, and \ninternational trade policy, including working with the UK government on \ntrade policies post Brexit. \n\u2022Our work in India has revolved around complex and labour-intensive value \nchains such as tea, textile, cotton and jute, supporting about 150,000 \nhouseholds. TX India has worked with a range of target groups, including \nwomen from ethnic minorities and tribes.\n\u2022In the tea sector for example, our work in India has benefited 70,000 small \ntea growers, with recognition of this sub-sector for the first time in the 11th \nFive Year Plan. We also supported the set-up of a Small Grower Directorate, \nthe formation of the Confederation of Small Tea Grower Associations, and \nthe co-option of Small Grower representatives on the Tea Board.\n\u2022\u201cWho Picked My Tea\u201d campaign facilitated by Traidcraft enabled the tea \nsector to move from complete silence over sourcing to gaining increased \ntransparency in the tea sector in the UK enabling consumers to track the tea \nthey drink from leaf to cup.\n\u2022We are currently implementing the \u201cPahadiya Samriddhi\u201d project in \nJharkhand which aims to reduce vulnerabilities of 3000 Pahariya (Primitive \nTribe) households by providing better access to markets and improve \nmanagement of natural resources\n\u2022We launched the first fair trade label in India called \u2018Shop for Change\u2019 \nwhich is now managed by a private body, and our cotton project helped test \nthe first Fairtrade standards for cotton by the Fairtrade Foundation in the \nearly 2000s. Additionally, our work in the textiles sector has enabled the \n12th Five Year Plan to focus on the occupational health & safety of artisans.\n\u2022Currently, we are working with Adivasi and Dalit communities in Madhya \nPradesh to address the systemic and structural vulnerabilities of \nagricultural communities to forced, bonded and child labour. We support the \ncreation of alternate avenues of income generation, and of people\u2019s \ninstitutions that work together to prevent exploitation.\n\u2022We are also currently growing our expertise on modern slavery issues in \nagricultural supply chains, improved working conditions for invisible \nworkers in the textiles sector (particularly homeworkers), and the promotion \nof sustainable agriculture.\n6d. Describe the current strategy of the organisation. (maximum 300 \nwords):\nTraidcraft Exchange uses the power of trade to bring about lasting solutions to \npoverty. We are on the side of people who are most vulnerable in trade - \nmarginalised workers and producers whose work goes unseen and whose voices \ngo unheard. We aim to support the most vulnerable groups including women, \nethnic minorities and people with disabilities. \nGrant Application Form, July 1 20138\n \nTX is committed to transforming ourselves from a UK-centric model into a locally \nrooted, globally connected organisation.  Pursuing this model enables us to \ndevolve responsibility and decision-making to our in-country teams and beyond \nthat, to cede power to the producers and workers who we are supporting. The \noverarching aim is to put communities in the driving seat of decisions and \nprocesses related to their lives and livelihoods by using participatory \nmethodologies and listening to communities and partners. \n \nIn this context, Traidcraft Exchange\u2019s core purpose is to identify, support and \ninvest in farmer associations, worker collectives, social enterprises and civil \nsociety organisations that are challenging the negative impacts of mainstream \ntrade and developing alternative business models that put people and planet first. \nWe will be standing alongside communities who are vulnerable and have been \nmarginalised, supporting them to develop businesses that work for them, that \nprotect and respect their local eco-systems and that build their resilience. And in \ndoing this, we will support them to build their power. Our UK advocacy and \ncampaigns work will complement this work and be rooted in the lived experiences \nof farmers and workers and the priorities of advocacy partners in-country, \naddressing the systemic and structural issues affecting people\u2019s lives.\n \nFurther, some of the key lessons derived from our past work in the tea sector \n(including programmatic work in India and policy/ campaigning work in the UK \nlevel) that forms part of the strategy for this project are:\n\u2022Need to engage with multiple stakeholders (including the garden \nmanagement, supply chain actors, government institutions like tea Board, \nTRA) to be effective on-ground. We have planned for such engagements in \nthe current application, whereby we shall involve garden management team \nin specific workstream; and also plan to do dissemination events including \nmultiple stakeholders.\n\u2022Creating community-based platforms for sustaining work in future \nphase. In our work with small tea growers (STG), as part of the EqualiTea \nproject, we facilitated STG associations at ground level, including national \nlevel STG federation taking forward the work with relevant stakeholders. \nThese community institutions (associations and federation) are still active \nmore than a decade since the project timeframe. In the current programme \nplan, we have kept provision for creating community collectives of women \nand youth in the Tea garden communities. These community institutions will \nprovide us the platform for work in the next phase of programmes \n(especially as we tackle some of the sensitive issues such as human \ntrafficking and gender based violence in tea garden communities in future \nphase of work)   \nCampaigning and media engagement does help in highlighting key issues with \nbrands and buyers: Traidcraft policy and campaigning unit, continuously engage \nwith UK based consumers to pressurize brands and companies to adopt ethical \nsourcing practices. We have run effective campaigns for Tea sector (such as \n#WhopickedmyTea campaign; https://traidcraftexchange.org/tea-answers ) for \ngreater transparency in supply chains of leading UK based tea brands. We are \nlooking to take advantage of the network of our Policy unit to disseminate \ninformation about our project activities to a wider audience with reach to \ninternational brands and buyers.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 20139\n6e. What problems are you addressing? What are the opportunities and \nchallenges in addressing these problems? (maximum 600 words):\nThe tea industry in India is the country\u2019s second largest employer in the formal \nsector. A large proportion of the tea produced in India comes from the four States \nof Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Directly and indirectly, the \nindustry employs over 3 million people, a majority of whom are women. Indian tea \nremains an important supplier to the global market even as the domestic \nconsumption base increases. Our study on the tea industry has focused on the \nconditions of workers in the tea gardens of Assam and West Bengal. The study \ncovered a total of 15 large tea estates (LTE); 23 small tea growers (STG\u2019s) and 6 \nclosed tea estates (CTE\u2019s) across the four clusters of Assam and West Bengal, \ninterviewing a total of 308 tea worker respondents. We have also sought to \nunderstand some of the challenges faced by the industry as a whole. We have \nscanned research reports on these topics from within the industry as well as from \nindependent academic researchers and institutions. We have also spoken to \nindustry leaders as well as civil society organizations working with tea workers. \nKey problems of the tea workers are:\nAlienation and Lost Identity: Most workers in the tea estates especially in \nAssam are descendants of workers who came to Assam under the indentured \nlabour arrangements of British India. They trace their roots to the Adivasi \nCommunities- mostly Mundas and Oraons of the Central India Belt- Odisha, \nJharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. Today they are recognized as \nTea and Ex \u2013 Tea Garden tribes and recognized as Other Backward Classes by the \nGovernment of Assam. In West Bengal, since Colonial times the workers were not \nindentured. Instead, plantation owners recruited them mostly from Nepal, with \nsome monetary compensation. Besides this, the workers are also santhals and \nadivasis from central India such as Oraons and Mundas. The incentives were \nmostly non-monetary in nature and included housing. These houses continued to \nbelong to the plantations and workers were only allowed to live and are expected \nto maintain the house for as long as they occupy them. Uprooted from their \noriginal roots, the workers are not connected to their social community. Living in \nisolated gardens with limited means of communication and exposure, most \nworkers live only as \u201cTea workers\u201d with other identities almost insignificant. \nAggravating this is the hostility and alienation faced from the natives of the state- \nespecially Assam due to which the Tea worker community face estrangement and a \nsense of lost identity.\nWorking conditions of workers: Our secondary research has brought up many \nindividual studies (Oxfam-2019, Banerji and Willoughby-2019, University of \nSheffield-2018, Behal-2017, CEE-2009), that describe the difficult living and \nworking conditions of tea workers. The colonial legacy of the industry continues to \ninform the relationship between the management of tea gardens and their \nworkers. The workers\u2019 unions that represent the workers\u2019 collective interests have \nbeen unable to represent these issues and have been vulnerable to the influences \nof mainstream political parties and estate management. The national laws \ngoverning the industry, specifically the Plantations Labour Act, 1951, have many \nenabling provisions but compliance monitoring is inadequate. The Act stipulates \nthat all tea estates shall provide to its workers amenities such a drinking water, \nseparate toilets, medical facilities, creches for child care, canteens, recreational \nfacilities, educational facilities and housing facilities. Our primary data suggests \npoor availability of these facilities across all categories of the tea gardens. Less \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201310\nthan a third of study participants reported satisfaction with the quality of the \nhousing they lived in. Drinking water is a serious issue in the gardens affecting \nwomen the most. Coupled with this, poor nutrition , very hard nature of work \nresult in health complications of women members in particular. The issue of low \nwages has been a consistent problem in the tea sector and has been a long-drawn \nstruggle for tea workers. The wages of tea estate works are neither aligned to \nMGNERGA norms nor anything in line with indices of the consumer price index. \nThe vulnerable workers often become victims of one upmanship between trade \nunions & employers who often work at cross purposes.            \nLack of awareness of workers and poor linkages to government schemes: \nOur study highlights low levels of awareness among workers. In responses to \nquestions about work promotions, only 7% of the participants in the LTE replied in \nthe affirmative. The issue of inadequate wages has been reported by many \nparticipants. However, only 27% of the participants showed awareness of regular \ndeductions from their wages. A third of the participants said that it was difficult to \naccess government schemes and within that group 50% are women.. The reasons \nthat they cited for this include the lack of awareness about the schemes, lack of \nnecessary documents and lack of timely information on the process to be followed, \ngeneral apathy of government officials towards tea worker community  \nLow family income, unemployment and underemployment: Low wages, poor \naccess to education and social differences with neighbouring communities have all \ncontributed to a poor capital accumulation within the tea workers community. \nMost of them do not possess land or if they do (as among the West Bengal tea \nworkers), it is just enough for homestead garden plots. Small livestock rearing is \nchallenging due to the lack of space and common land. Participants reporting \naccess to school beyond the primary level were only 18% of the sample and to high \nschool only2%. A little under half of the participants cite financial difficulties as \nthe reason for the discontinuation of their education. This circumstance has \nspawned several other social problems such as bonded labour, child labour, \ndestitution and trafficking of women and children. The nature of hiring workers \nwithin the tea industry & growing aspirations of youth creates a context of \nunderemployment and unemployment within the tea estates. This forces youth to \nmigrate out to urban centres in search of more gainful employment, often trapped \nand exploited by the traffickers.\nClimate and sustainability of the tea sector: On another front, the tea industry \nis vulnerable to climate change. Extreme climactic events affect both production \nand processing cycles of the tea crop. These changes in the meteorological factors \nhave also a negative impact on the number & severity of incidences of pests and \ndisease infestations, soil quality and soil erosion. If this trend continues, large \nparts where tea is grown currently will become unviable for commercial tea \nproduction in two to three decades. The industry is also facing multiple problems \nrelated to output price stagnation, higher factor costs of production, ageing of the \nbushes in the organized estates, labour shortages & absenteeism, regulatory \nhurdles, lack of policy support & reforms, current market structure & the gradual \nshifting of consumer preference towards other beverages.\n \nGiven the complex multi-layered issues of vulnerability among tea workers and the \ntea sector as a whole, a multi phased approach to ensure a sustainable \nintervention is required. This is intended to be the first phase of a multi-phase \nintervention, where an enabling eco-system for dialogue and mutual trust will be \nbuilt with the various stakeholders. This approach is informed by our \nunderstanding that to achieve any sustainable change in the lives of tea workers, \ninterventions will have to work at multiple levels of the worker communities, tea \nestate management as well as government. The projects aims to create win win \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201311\nsituation for workers, Garden management and Government by addressing \npractical issues like livelihood enhancement of workers, bridging entitlement \naccess gaps , demonstrating pilots for better living conditions in gardens through \nsolutions for drinking water etc. An enabling eco-system that includes \ncollaborative engagement will lead to improved and dignified quality of life of \nworkers in the long run.  We intend to play a catalytic role through establishing a \nmodel which engages various stakeholders and is guided by our own strength and \nmission of shifting the power in trade.\n \nIn the first phase 42 months, we propose to undertake entry point interventions \nwith large tea estates (LTE) and closed tea gardens (CTG)), that will address the \nissues of:\na) lacking skill & income enhancement opportunities for tea worker communities;\nb) Improve awareness and access to social entitlements through joint action \nbetween tea worker communities, tea garden management, government officials \netc.\nc) Address solidarity and Cooperation through mobilizing women and youth in the \nTea gardens for regular capacity building, information sharing and enhancing \ntheir role within the community;\nd) Pilot interventions to address Climate Change impacts in collaboration with Tea \nResearch Association and other multistakeholder forums like Trustea/ Trinitea etc.\ne) Create informal platform of likeminded CSOs and representatives of Tea worker \ncommunities working in tea sector with a view to learn and promote good \npractices and strengthen sectoral understanding on the issues of Tea workers and \nTea sector as a whole; and\nf) Build capacities of local partner organizations on facilitation skills, worker \nrights, skill trainings and migration so they can lead the change process in the \nfuture.\n \nIn the subsequent phases, besides broadening its intervention to gardens, the \nwork will build upon the stakeholder forums, community institutions and technical \ninnovations developed during this phase.  Intensive and deepened work around \nworking conditions and worker rights will be facilitated through constructive \ndialogue and consultations with the Tea estate managements and stakeholders \nforum. Simultaneously, issues of domestic violence against women, issues of \ntrafficking and safe migration for youth will be addressed upfront by the \nempowered community institutions built in this phase. Using its experience in \nConsumer and brand engagement, Traidcraft will also work towards raising \nconsumer awareness in domestic and international markets through campaigns \nand engage brands to adhere to transparency & ethical standards. Traidcraft will \nalso leverage its experience gained in working with Large Tea estates to promote \nSustainability standards by informing the Garden management on standards, \nfacilitating them in adoption of practices to qualify for standards like \nTrustea/Trinitea for the domestic tea industry and ensuring their accountability \nthrough transparent self-disclosures. The informal network of CSO\u2019s and \nlikeminded agencies, individuals, workers representatives etc. will be steered to \nevolve as a resource network for tea agencies/gardens and other CSOs to learn, \nensure that tea workers voices are amplified, promote best practices and engage \nin facilitating programs and funding. Traidcraft\u2019s new portfolio approach to work \non the issues of workers and Tea workers being one of the key programmatic \nfocus, will enable its long-term commitment to the issue and bring in additional \ninvestment for future phases and programming.                \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201312\n \nThe next sections in the document outline in detail the intervention plan for the \nCurrent phase.", "7. OBJECTIVES": "7. Objectives (maximum 2,200 words)\nFor a core support grant, state the purpose of this grant request and complete the \nobjectives.  After consultations with an Oak PO, you may decide to summarise your \nmission as one broad objective. In this case, it is still necessary to specify activities \nand results/outcomes for this objective.\nFor project support grants please list your objectives for this project in bullet point \nformat. (You may use additional space if you have more than three objectives)?. \nUnder each objective describe the activities that your organisation will undertake to \nachieve it, including time frame and the results or outcomes you expect to achieve.\n7.1.a. Objective 1 (maximum one sentence):\nStrengthened community groups of Women and Youth representing 9,000 tea \nworker households from 35 tea estates (Closed and Large Tea gardens; 10 in \nAssam and 25 in West Bengal) to access rights, schemes and entitlements through \nimproved awareness, leadership and joint action           \n7.1.c. Objective 1\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\nAccess to information and awareness of rights, government schemes and \nentitlements within the tea worker communities has been found to be quite poor, \npreventing many of the tea worker families to access the benefits of the schemes. \nTheir awareness related to the workers\u2019 rights has been also found to be quite low \nas only 9% of the tea workers working in the large tea estates responded that they \nwere aware of laws protecting their rights. As a result, uptake on social security \n7.1.b. Objective 1\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\nKey results achieved under this objective are:\na. 246 Women\u2019s Groups and 35 Youth forums demonstrate enhanced \nconfidence and leadership to access their rights and entitlements. About \n60% households in Assam and West Bengal (6600 HHs) will be linked to \nminimum 1 Government programs or entitlements.\nb. Garden management, Panchayats and Government working together with \nthe community groups to address the issues of access, quality & timeliness \nof entitlements     \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201313\nschemes, health and nutrition benefits is also low despite high levels of \nmalnutrition and poor health of women and children, Even in the closed tea \ngardens where the District Administration takes over the management and \nfacilitates these entitlements, most often lack of community demand and \nremoteness of the gardens, the workers are left out. On the other hand, \nunderemployment and unemployment of youth are on the rise which leads to \nforced migration. Most people migrate to other cities and states through local \nagents who promise them of lucrative opportunities which quite often becomes a \nvicious trap of exploitation. The primary research threw light on many cases of \ntrafficking that is on the rise. Cutting across these, is a deep sense of alienation \nand isolation of the community who are mostly tribal people with a colonial history \nof being uprooted from their original villages. Life in the tea gardens has not \nhelped in integration with the mainstream people of the West Bengal and Assam. \nThere is despondency and lack of agency which pushes them further to the \nmargins.\n \nHence, there is a need to collectivise and build on the community strength to exert \ntheir voice and improve awareness and knowledge on their rights and entitlements \nbesides nurturing their sense of community and leadership. \n \nThe activities will be done through a participatory approach with engagement and \nhandholding of women and youth to be able to lead their own pathway of change, \nexpand their networks and articulate their needs. Following are the key \nfoundational activities planned:\n \n1.Mobilising Communities \u2013 Women groups and Youth Forums: At the \noutset of the project, mapping of the 10 selected tea gardens in Assam and \n25 tea gardens in West Bengal to assess the status of the existing women\u2019s \ngroup formed in the past (as part of government initiatives) which now are \neither dysfunctional, inactive or weak will be undertaken.\nAlongside, youth in the tea gardens will also be mobilised and organised as \nyouth forums. These Youth forums will provide an open space to youth to \nexpress themselves, build their skills and engage in welfare of their community \nmembers. Through mobilising support from expert agencies, Traidcraft will \nbuild capacities of partners in developing a structured approach to youth \nengagement,\nDepending on their social cohesion, the community will be organised as per \ntheir settlement pattern \u2013 for example in Assam the women groups will be \norganised based on their labour lines (this is how housing is defined on tea \nestates); whereas in West Bengal, women will be organised considering the size \nof the group (30 women per group). A total of 246 Women\u2019s Groups (200 in \nWest Bengal, 46 in Assam) and 35 Youth forums (25 in West Bengal and 10 in \nAssam) will be formed in Year 1.\n2.Capacity Building and Awareness: Women\u2019s groups will be capacitated \non livelihood activities, nutrition and health, social security schemes etc, \nCapacity building of youth groups entail building soft skills, cultural identity, \nyouth and development, rights and entitlements, safe migration and career \ncounselling.. In order to build networks, relevant resource agencies and \ngovernment officials will be brought in to deliberate on the topic of their \nrelevance. The activity will be undertaken both on Year 1 and Year 2 \n3.Facilitation for access to Entitlements: Community institutions i.e. \nWomen\u2019s groups and Youth forums will be facilitated to support in accessing \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201314\nthe various entitlements and schemes.  This would include mapping the \nhouseholds eligible for social security, health and nutrition and other \nrelevant entitlements; assistance in registration, documentation etc. \nCommunity groups will also be supported to monitor the services of ICDS \nand Health centres and facilitated to liaise with the relevant authorities to \naccess quality services. The project will also facilitate setting up a \ncoordination committee at the block level engaging Panchayats and relevant \ngovernment departments to facilitate the access of various \nschemes.  Schemes and entitlements that would be facilitated are: a. \nPension schemes (example - National Old Age Pension, Widow Pension, \nArunodoi - financial assistance to women - widow, differently abled, \nunmarried, divorcee); Student scholarship & Financial assistance for \nstudents/youths for studies and self-employment; skill development \nprograms such as Swahid Dayal Das Panika Swaniyojan Achoni (specifically \ndesigned for the tea worker communities in Assam) etc.\n7.2.a. Objective 2 (maximum one sentence):\n3500 HHs (3000 HHs in West Bengal and 500 HHs in Assam) & 1500 youth (1000 \nin West Bengal and 500 in Assam) have increased resilience and choices through \nknowledge of improved practices, new skills, services and information thereby \nimproving their livelihood and income opportunities\n7.2.c. Objective 2\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\nOur primary study reveals that the incidences of underemployment, seasonal \nunemployment & permanent unemployment are very high among tea workers & \nyouth of the family. This is further aggravated by low wage rates, low levels of \nskills & lack of avenues for alternative employment. As per the study, on an \naverage a permanent worker in a tea garden worker earns ? 44,000/- per annum \nwith 271 working days; whereas a temporary worker in the garden earns ? \n31,300/- per annum with 187 working days. Further, the study highlighted that \n80% of the participants have been provided access to primary school for their \nchildren but access to the next stage of schooling is only 18% and under 5% report \naccess to secondary and higher secondary schools. Thus, the tea workers & youth \n7.2.b. Objective 2\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\na. 3500 Tea worker households have increased access to information, \nknowledge about improved farming and allied practices to diversify income. \nAbout 60% of the HH\u2019s will show 20-30% increase in their income\n1500 Youth from Tea worker community have increased opportunity for jobs or \nenterprise through improved knowledge and skills on specific market-oriented \ntrade. About 50% of the trained youth who are placed/started their enterprise \ncontinue to work in the same vocation.    \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201315\nof the family (both male & female) often migrate to distant locations & engage in \nlow paying unorganized sectors. Without informed choice many of them also fall \nprey to trafficking as this is seen as the only way out of this situation. Hence the \ncreation of alternative livelihoods and the generation of supplementary income are \nkey areas to intervene for sustenance of the families of tea workers.  \n \nThe proposed action, both farm and farm allied income generating opportunities \nwill be carried out with 3500 households (3000 HHs in West Bengal, 500 HHs in \nAssam). Simultaneously, 1500 youth (1000 in West Bengal and 500 in Assam) will \nbe trained on vocational skills and provided with jobs and opportunity to be self-\nemployed.      \n \na.Farm and Farm allied income generation with 3500 Households:\n \nLivelihood planning for each household will be based on a participatory \nassessment and analysis of resources, skills, capacities of the Tea worker \nhouseholds. Our approach would entail optimum use of their homestead lands and \nincrease in their productive assets, mostly around livestock. We understand that \nworkers have no ownership rights on their dwellings or homestead lands, \ntherefore interventions will be planned and carried out with active engagement of \nrespective garden managements to mitigate the risks of unanticipated decisions of \ngarden managements. Tea worker households will be able to utilise their \nresources optimally through inputs and trainings on improved and scientific \npractices, diversification and improved skills.. All this will be facilitated by \ncreating local cadres of trained people who can continue to provide these services \nand knowledge to the local community. Key activities would include:\n \ni.Optimum utilisation of Homestead Lands: The project would facilitate \npromotion of multi-layered kitchen gardens meeting nutritional as well as \nincome needs of the tea worker families. Model of kitchen gardens will be \nestablished considering the seasonal variation and will include Vegetables \nsuch as brinjal, leafy vegetables, tomatoes etc.; Creepers such as bottle \ngourd, pumpkin; and Spices such as coriander & garlic. This will ensure \naccess to low-cost healthy diets throughout the year, save household \nexpenses & also provide opportunity for additional income.  A total of 600 \nkitchen gardens will be promoted (150-200 kitchen gardens each year) \nduring the project duration. (Ongoing-Year 1,2,3 & 4)\nii.Improvement in Productive assets - Livestock: The project will also \nprovide scientific technical trainings on backyard poultry, piggery (in \nBengal only) and goatery which will help reduce the high mortality rate of \nthe existing inventory of livestock & enable households to increase their \noverall HH income. This will be done through establishing both backward \nand forward linkages. Exposures and capacity building sessions by technical \nexperts in Bengal & Assam will be carried out to develop a community cadre \n(30), which will essentially take care the necessary need of vet care \nservices. Simultaneously, efforts will be made to collectivise and facilitate \nthe collective sale through the existing women\u2019s group. Further \nconvergence with line departments like animal resources departments, \nagriculture departments, horticulture departments, KVKs (Krishi Vigyan \nKendras) will be made for ensuring scale & sustainability beyond the \nproject. (Ongoing-Year 1,2,3 & 4)\nBlack pepper plantation around Areca Nut Tree: Many of the Tea workers \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201316\nhouseholds have Areca nut Tree in their homestead land. Black Pepper is the \nmost compatible perennial spice crop with areca nut and can be profitably \ngrown. The project will promote Black pepper and help tea worker households \nto learn the basics of its management. It takes three years for the black pepper \nto fruit, and in this period the project will also undertake market assessments \nto help the Women groups market these produce at fair prices, thereby \naugmenting their incomes.\n \nb.Vocational Skills with 1500 Youth:\n \nGiven that youth segment has an aspiration for other jobs beyond tea gardens, the \nproject will work with youth (both Male and female) to help them with relevant \nemployable and self-employable skills and assist them in getting jobs and/or start \ntheir own enterprise. Given the limited opportunities in the area, the project will \nmake an assessment of the skills and trades in which youth are engaged when they \nmigrate out of the state. Focussing on some of these trades will enable them to \nseek better wages at their destination locations. Youth who would want to set \nup/establish their own enterprise, targeted business and financial skills will also be \nimparted. Besides this, the project will also engage in building their self-esteem \nand leadership that are rooted in their cultural context and identity.        \n \nThe proposed action is based on the interest and aspirations of the youth. \nIdentification of vocational courses will be done based on assessment of their \ninterests and willingness to pursue the same as their career choice as well as \nmarket demand. Relevant training and courses will be offered in collaboration with \nGovernment recognised skill training institutions or other institutions having \nspecialised modules for selected trades. Post training, efforts will be made to link \ntrained youth to placement companies for jobs in the mainstream market or to \nfinancial institutions for setting up small business. Key activities include:\n \ni.Needs and Skills assessment for prioritising vocational courses and \nenterprises for skill trainings and enterprise promotion (Year 1): The \nproject will introduce a process of selection based on individual choices and \ninterests of youth. For example \u2013 in West Bengal counselling and career \nguidance will help youth to take informed choices around the various \nofferings. At the same time, in Assam, an open discussion with the youth of \nthe gardens and availability of local opportunities/offerings will help youth \nto share their willingness to join relevant courses. The project will also map \nsome of the skill gaps highlighted from major employers which would also \ninform their choices in pursuing their career aspirations.\nii.Enterprise development, Skill trainings on the identified vocational \ncourses through Resource Organisations or Government sponsored trainings \nsuch as Skill Mission, Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) \netc. (Y2: 500; Y3: 750; Y4: 250): Based on the skill gap and the choices \nshared by youth, the teams will organise the training offerings either \nthrough linking them with government run skill centres or resource \norganisations specialised in offering the courses. In Assam, an incubation \ncentre will be set up for youth who wants to pursue the courses to set up \ntheir own enterprise. Besides technical training, additional trainings on \nBusiness and financial skills will also be imparted to them.  Few of the \nvocational courses to be imparted to youth (as highlighted during our study) \nare \u2013 Police, Driving, Hospitality, Chef, Motor Mechanic, Beautician, Sewing \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201317\nOperator etc.       \niii.Counselling sessions, placement linkages and financial linkages \nthrough collaboration with placement agencies and financial \ninstitutions (Ongoing): The project will have a dedicated resource to work \nwith various placement and employer companies to be able to support the \ntrained youth in assuring their placements. Before the completion of the \nvocational courses, counselling sessions and softer skills to handle the \nchanges in a new work environment, adjustments to the new place, do\u2019s and \ndon\u2019ts of working will be undertaken. Youth who are keen to set up their \nown enterprises will be either linked to Banks for seed capital or linked to \ngovernment schemes such as MUDRA loan, Start Up India scheme, etc.\n7.3.a. Objective 3 (maximum one sentence):\nTo establish model for improving productivity and mitigating risks of climate \nchange through adoption of climate adaptive practices in two tea select gardens of \nWest Bengal  \n7.3.c. Objective 3\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\nAs per the research done by Tea Research Association, climate change is \nimpacting the tea producers in a significant way, as tea is mainly grown under \nrain-fed mono-cropping systems and weather conditions determine optimal growth \n& quality of tea. The current trend of irregular nature of rainfall in the area, forces \nthe growers to invest in irrigation facilities which also increases costs besides \nsevere shortage of drinking water to the tea workers, who live on the gardens. \nFurthermore, declining productivity, increased incidences of pests and diseases \ncompels the garden managements to use heavy doses of pesticides and chemicals \nhaving bearing on soil, the food safety standards & impacts severely on the health \nof the consumers and workers who are exposed to such chemicals. The study done \nby TRA assess that if this trend continues, large parts, where tea is grown \ncurrently will become unviable for commercial tea production in two to three \ndecades. \n \n7.3.b. Objective 3\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\na. Results of the Innovations and climate adaptive practices shared widely with \nthe other Tea Gardens/planters including government thereby improving \nvisibility and demand from the other tea gardens\nb.   Garden management and workers in 2 tea gardens show enhanced \nunderstanding and adaptation to climate change practices, perceives reduced risks \nand cost\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201318\nHence, the project intends to demonstrate and pilot innovative adaptive measures \nand create models of best practices to be further promoted & replicated to other \ntea gardens.  The project will work with two tea gardens in West Bengal. These \ntwo gardens will be selected based on the level of cooperation extended by garden \nmanagement and secondly on the extent of scarcity of drinking water in the \ngardens.\nThe proposed activities related are:\n \na.Water Recharging and harvesting measures: Since most of the tea \ngardens are located on undulating terrains, the runoff levels are high \nleading to drying up of natural springs which are the lifeline in the regions. \nOne hectare of mature tea plants require 10,000 litres of water per day \nwhich is equivalent to 2.5mm rainfall. Tea plants also need water after \npruning which is generally done during the months of Nov- Dec. This is the \nperiod when there is less rainfall resulting growers to invest in irrigation \nfacilities. Therefore, interventions on recharging ground water, protecting \ncatchments and reviving springs are critical and requires conjunctive \ninterventions by tea management as well as government. Following pilots \nwill be initiated:  \noWater recharge through rainwater harvesting will be initiated in the \ngardens in convergence with the Government and garden \nmanagement leveraging existing Government programmes. This \nwould start with the development of a well recharge plan based on \nthe principles of springshed management. A total of six such recharge \nstructure (three each in 2 Tea Gardens) will be undertaken (Y1 and Y \n3).    \noTwo pilots on providing drinking water will be carried out. This will \nbe a low cost and zero energy intensive model by diverting natural \nsprings and using gravity, channelling the water to the households. \nHouseholds will have potable water close to their homes which can be \nused for drinking and also for irrigation in their homesteads. This will \nbe done in Year 2 and Year 3   \nb.Climate adaptive practices: In this area, the activities will include \ntraining Tea garden management and workers on good climate resilient \npractices and in situ management. Demonstrations in propagation of \ndrought and stress tolerant cultivars, promotion of shade trees, \nintercropping, nutrient management through vermicompost, pest \nmanagement etc. will be done in collaboration with the Garden management \nin the two gardens. This will enable the garden management to experiment \nand introduce new practices in the garden. Trainings will be carried out in \ncollaboration with Tea Research Association (TRA) in Year 1 and Year 2. \nAdditionally, in association with TRA or private companies, environmental \nstewardship training shall be conducted in the two gardens to reduce \nenvironmental load of agro- chemicals and also workers safety at workplace. \nA total of 2 such trainings will be done in Year 2 and Year 3.\nc.Sustainability Standards: There is a growing trend in consumer \nawareness and brands across all segments are working towards engaging \nwith consumers to enhance transparency in sustainability practices adopted \nby them. Certification is usually done by third party agencies which is a \nmeans of providing assurance to the consumers on the sustainability \nstandards adopted by the organisations. In association with certification \nagencies such as Trustea, Rainforest Alliance and others, the project will \nfacilitate trainings for the two garden managements on standards for \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201319\ncertification and also expose the garden management to other gardens who \nhave implemented these standards. The project will encourage the garden \nmanagements in developing an implementation plan to meet the standards \nfor certification and also assist them in case of further need. This activity \nwill be initiated in Year 2 and carried on in Year 3. The project will facilitate \nthe tea gardens to adopt the best practices as per the sustainability \nstandards, however, the garden management will bear the cost of \ncertification.  \nDocumentation and development of IEC: The project will document and \nunderstand the results of the various innovations and best practices adopted by \nthe tea gardens. Appropriate IEC and communication materials will be developed \nand shared widely with various platforms and importantly across the gardens of \nintervention. Longitudinal study will be carried out on an annual basis to be able \nto understand the changes, inform and develop the IEC and communication \nmaterials\n7.4.a. Objective 4 (maximum one sentence):\nInformal Forum of Civil Society Organisations constructively engage for giving \ngreater voice and visibility to the conditions of tea worker community through \ncollective action and advocacy.\n7.4.c. Objective 4\u2013 Activities and timeframe (maximum 300 words):\nThe baseline research highlighted the multidimensional nature of vulnerability and \nissues of Tea worker communities across gender, age and social factors. Several \nCSOs, national and international organisations have worked towards addressing \nsome of these problems. With the changing context and policy regime affecting the \ntea industry, there is a constant need to learn and share knowledge, practices and \ncreate an enabling platform for cooperation and collaboration amongst various \norganisations working on Tea worker issues in particular and Tea sector in \ngeneral. The new labour code that is expected to replace the Plantation Labour Act \n1951 offers an important opportunity for broad based understanding and wide \ndissemination of the labour Code. There is scope for like-minded organisations to \ncome together as a support for Tea workers using their collective strength, \nexperience and influencing powers. This will provide greater visibility to the nearly \n7.4.b. Objective 4\u2013 Expected results/outcomes and timeframe (maximum 300 \nwords):\na. CSO forum identifies at least two policy areas affecting tea workers and \nundertake joined up action as per the advocacy plan  \nb. Communication materials on new labour Code allows for easier and broad \nbased understanding of the provisions for all stakeholders including garden \nmanagement and tea workers\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201320\ninvisible workers of the most popular beverage of the country\n \nTraidcraft has past experience of successfully carrying out campaigns, research \nand advocating for policies regarding small tea growers and issues pertaining to \nAssam Tea workers. Building on this experience, Traidcraft India along with its \nexperts from the Policy team at Traidcraft UK would facilitate and steer the \ninformal forum of CSOs for peer to peer learning, sharing practices, capacity \nbuilding, issue based work and policy advocacy.\n \nThe following activities will be done under this objective:\n \na.Setting up the forum and joint agenda setting: The project will map \nrelevant CSOs, understand their expertise and assess their interest in \nworking with the Tea workers. In the Year 1 of the project, it would organise \nmeeting with the CSO\u2019s that show their interest and co-create its agenda \nand set policy goals. The informal CSO forum will work on creating \nawareness on identified topics through print media, social media and policy \nbriefs. One of the key agenda for the group would be to work on the Labour \nCode which replaces the Plantation Labour act. Specifically, the work would \nbe around simplified understanding of the key aspects of the new Labour \nCode, translations in local language and wider dissemination through \nworkshops and round tables. Other areas identified at this stage are to map \ngaps in specific State level rules post transposition of Central level Labour \nCode which affect Tea workers adversely. Mapping of these gaps would lead \nto identification of Policy asks and strategize accordingly.\nb.Issue Based Workshops and Round tables: Periodically, Traidcraft \nwould facilitate knowledge sharing through issue-based workshops and \nround tables for shared understanding on specific issues - for e.g. workers\u2019 \nrights, new labour code, women and violence, trafficking etc. Four round \ntables and issue-based learning sessions over Year 2 and Year 3 would be \norganised. This would also help strengthen capacities of the CSO partners of \nthe forum besides developing collective strategy and joined up action to \naddress the various issues of the Tea workers, both in West Bengal and \nAssam. This would be complemented by Policy Advocacy team at UK taking \nup an assessment of business performance of Tea companies to assess the \noverall viability of the companies and scope to invest for welfare of workers. \nInsights from this study will feed into advocacy strategy at UK and India \nlevel in the next phase.\nCommunication and Dissemination event: Working paper, discussions from \nthe round table, communication materials on the new labour code, learnings from \nthe project, results from the longitudinal study etc. will form some of the key \ndocuments and knowledge product of the project. Communication material in form \nof audio visual would also be developed for creating visibility on the of issues of \ntea worker communities. The same will be disseminated as part of the National \nlevel dissemination event and other forums, that will be organised in the Year 4.  \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201321", "8. COOPERATION": "8. Cooperation\nDescribe the level of cooperation with other organisations and networks \nand explain how this cooperation helps achieve your goals (maximum 300 \nwords):\nTraidcraft Exchange will work closely with local partners Prasari in West Bengal \nand Pajhra in Assam in a spirit of co-implementors with Partners driving the work \non the ground, and Traidcraft providing the technical support, and amplifying tea \nworkers voices by convening forums and use of social media. Both CSOs have been \nworking in the region and have good relationships with the tea communities. \nTraidcraft will work with its India counterpart - Traidcraft Services Private Limited \n(TSIPL) \u2013 a wholly owned subsidiary of Traidcraft Exchange. TSIPL is a social \nenterprise working towards trade justice and climate justice. TSIPL supports fair \ntrade and responsible business practices that benefit workers and producers and \noffer strategic advisory and consulting services that are backed with the capacity \nto support on-ground implementation across India\u2019s diverse geographies. Besides \nmanaging the overall program, Traidcraft (TSIPL) will specifically lead the work on \nClimate adaptive practices (objective 3) in collaboration with Tea Research \nAssociation, Tea Garden management and on ground support from Prasari. \nSimultaneously, Traidcraft including the Traidcraft Exchange policy unit in UK will \nlead in setting up and coordination of the informal CSO group (Objective 4). \nParallelly, the Traidcraft team will also support both Prasari and Pajhra in market \nlinkages and help trained youth find jobs in Companies, build linkages with \nplacement agencies and help set up robust collective enterprises (Objective 2). \nImportantly, the project\u2019s learning will be facilitated through annual planning and \nreflection workshops, enabling both Prasari and Pajhra synergies their on-ground \nactions for future.                            \n \nPRASARI, established in 2007, works specifically in the areas of water security, \ndiversion-based irrigation to augment the water, and income and nutritional \nsecurity of the rural households. It works through establishing multi-tiered \nwomen-led institutions which are the building blocks to execute any programme. \nThey are active in the Dooars region (Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling, Kalimpong, \nAlipurduar) of West Bengal and have successfully piloted diversion-based \nirrigation projects in collaboration with the government and other philanthropic \ndonors. Prasari will implement the project across 25 tea gardens across Jalpaiguri, \nKalimpong and Darjeeling. Specific role of Prasari in this project includes: a) \nestablishing robust women and youth forum in all the 25 Tea Gardens in West \nBengal; b) work closely with government and Tea garden management in linking \nup with various social entitlement schemes including nutrition, drinking water, \nenterprise development etc.; c) establishing farm based livelihoods to 3000 \nhouseholds and counselling and ensuring skill training of 1000 youth; and d) \nundertake innovative pilots around spring shed, well recharge and diversion based \ndrinking water. While they have been working specifically with women primarily \nlooking at water, livelihoods and nutritional security, working with youth and using \na rights perspective from the workers point of view would be a newer area for \nthem. The project will support building their capacities by bringing experts \nworking on youth mobilisation and development. Exposure to Assam and Pajhra \nwill inform their orientation on youth mobilisation as well as build their worker\u2019s \nrights perspective. Traidcraft will also help them in bringing in a market \nperspective for some of the on-farm and off-farm livelihoods besides building \nlinkages and networks for the placement of skilled youth in urban areas.              \n    \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201322\nPAJHRA was established in November 2001 by a group of Adivasi social activists \nand leaders. It works towards building capabilities of the Adivasi community to \naccess their entitlements, improve their socio-economic status in the society and \ntheir wellbeing, and promoting social integration of Adivasis from all walks of life \nin Assam. Pajhra will implement the project across 10 tea gardens across \nBiswanath and Sonitpur districts in Assam. In this project, Pajhra will specifically \nlead on: a) establishing robust women and youth forum in all the 10 Tea Gardens \nin Assam; b) working closely with government and Tea garden management in \nlinking up with various social entitlement schemes including nutrition, drinking \nwater, youth scholarship, enterprise development etc.; c) establishing farm based \nlivelihoods to 500 households and counselling and ensuring skill training of 500 \nyouth. In addition to this, Pajhra will also bring its knowledge on the issue of Tea \nworkers and build perspective around wage and living wage within the CSO \ngroup.  Pajhra has been working with tea workers, which are primarily Adivasis, \nand have been actively developing youth and women leaders within the \ncommunity. Skill building, enterprise development for youth and climate adaptive \npractices will be a newer area of work for them. Traidcraft will mentor Pajhra\u2019s \nimplementation team in ensuring business and market linkage support. At the \nsame time, engagement with TRA and exposure to Prasari\u2019s project area will build \ntheir perspective on climate adaptive practices. \n \nAnother area of cooperation and support sought by both organisations is in the \narea of Organisational Development. Pajhra has expressed their need for \nreviewing their organisational work and identify areas that require improvement \nor strengthening. Based on the review, Pajhra would also be open to consider a \npossible restructuring. This has been also mandated by their Board and would \nhave full support from their leadership team. Prasari, who has recently undergone \nan Organisational Review Exercise and is already implementing the \nrecommendations, is keen to develop inhouse capacities within management team \nto take up Organisational Development (OD) and Learning in future. They would \nlike to invest in capacity building of management team members on OD processes.\n \nApart from these two field partner CSOs, the program will also engage other \nstakeholders and agencies, primarily towards achieving its objective for piloting \nclimate adaptive practices & sustainability standards in the tea gardens and \nestablishing an informal CSO group working for the welfare of tea workers both at \nregional and national level. Traidcraft will spearhead both the partnership and \nleading the thematic area, given its own capability and knowledge in the tea sector \nand understanding of the system of managing and implementing standards.\nFor climate adaptive practices, we would partner with the Tea Research \nAssociation (TRA) \u2013 which has been set up principally to improve the overall \nproductivity and quality of the tea. It is a pioneer and innovator in tea research \nand provides extension services to the tea industry. We are already in discussion \nwith TRA HQ in Kolkata and they have their field offices both at Jorhat (Assam) \nand Jalpaiguri (West Bengal). In relation to improving and promoting sustainability \nstandards (both climate as well as worker friendly) in the tea gardens where we \nwould work, we will engage with multi stakeholder initiatives such as Trustea (an \nIndian sustainability code and verification system for the tea sector working with \nsmallholder tea growers, bought leaf factories, estates and packers to address \nsome of the key challenges in the industry including working conditions, health \nand safety of tea workers, water pollution, food safety, soil erosion and \ncontamination) and/or Trinitea (an Indian initiative to transform the tea \nsmallholder segment in India while taking care of the social and environmental \nissues).\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201323\n    \nFor initiating the informal CSO group, we will partner with a number of like-\nminded CSO\u2019s and MSI\u2019s that are active in working for the welfare of tea workers \nand the tea sector overall. Organisations like Oxfam, Nazdeek, UNWomen, Unicef, \nSolidaridad and many more will be contacted to be a part of this initiative. We \nhave discussed the idea with Oxfam, and they have shown a very positive response \non the same.      \n \nIn addition to this, expert organisations working on the issues of youth, skill \nbuilding, leadership and domestic violence will be roped in as resource agencies to \nbe able to support the partners\u2019 capacity development.", "9. MONITORING, EVALUATION & LEARNING": "9. Impact\nWhat is the change you want to achieve from the overall project? (maximum \n300 words):\nIn this phase, the project will be able to build the foundation of stronger and \nempowered tea community across 35 tea Gardens. Besides this, an enabling \nenvironment and engagement model between tea garden management, tea \ncommunities, government and CSO\u2019s will be strengthened. Successful models of \nclimate adaptive practices will be tested and will be ready to be scaled to other tea \ngardens. At the end of the project, following expected impacts are envisaged:\nThe following changes are envisaged at the end of four year:\n \n\u2022Strengthened community groups and forums working with the Garden \nManagement, Panchayats and Government officials to improve the delivery \nof various services and entitlements. \n\u2022Improved choices and alternative options of Tea worker communities \nthrough diversified livelihoods, skills and knowledge.

Evaluation\nHow will progress be monitored and evaluated? (maximum 300 words):\nOur commitment to understanding the impact of our programmes and driving \ncontinued learning and improving, requires that we utilize robust M&E methods, \nsystems and tools. Following mechanisms will be put in place to assess the \nprogress, monitor and evaluate the success of the project;\n \na. Participatory approach to MEL: Traidcraft Exchange will adopt a \nparticipatory approach for monitoring the progress of the project. This will \nbe determined by the local communities\u2019 identification of the metrics of \ntheir progress based on the ground situation and the baseline. Supporting \nproject participants to themselves determine their metrics will enable a \nprocess of empowerment of local workers in the tea estate which will \nstrengthen their sense of agency and also increase their mutual \ncollaboration for collective benefit. Traidcraft has experience to support \nlocal collectives on participatory monitoring of their own development and \nwill guide the process in the duration of the project. In addition to this, \nengaging selected beneficiaries for longitudinal case studies which is a more \nqualitative approach to capture changes in their lives over a period of time, \nwill be undertaken by the project. Such studies supported by case studies \nwill capture degree of change in confidence and leadership abilities of the \ntarget group. This will include improvement in livelihoods, agency and \naspirations, access to entitlements etc.\n \nb. Logical Framework Analysis (LFA) based progress assessment: \nComplementing the above participatory approach to MEL, the project will \nhave a clear set of indicators for each outcome and output area outlined \nabove based on the LFA framework. Development of the LFA and monitoring \nframework at the outset of the initiation of the project will be carried out in \ncollaboration with the on-ground partners \u2013 viz. Prasari and Pajhra. This will \nbe guided by a detailed baseline that will be done in the first year of the \nproject.  Data will be collected against the set indicators for the above-\nmentioned Outcome areas. Specifically, data on current levels of production \nin the two pilot gardens, availability and accessibility of drinking water, \nsources of water and cultivation practices will be collected in baseline and \nmapped annually to understand the changes on these parameters as well as \nadoption of recommended practices on environment and safety measures.  A \ndynamic excel based project MIS will be developed to capture the data and \ntrack the progress.  \n \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201325\nc. Ongoing Monitoring and Learning: Traidcraft India will manage all M&E \nactivities with support from our UK-based Quality & Impact Lead. Monthly \nreview meetings with partners will be done as part of planning and \nmonitoring. External members of Traidcraft will join quarterly meetings \nwhich will be documented through quarterly reports and meeting minutes. \nThese meetings will provide opportunities for the project team to reflect on \nprogress, learning and implications for adaptive programming. In addition, \nthe project will also organise annual partners meet for reflections and \nplanning for the upcoming year. These annual reflection exercises are \nfacilitated to capture individual and collective learnings on the project, that \nare essential for future planning. In addition, it helps in identifying \nshortcomings and build common strategy to address as a group. Annual \nNarrative and Financial Reports will be prepared that will be shared with \nOak Foundation on a periodic basis.\n \nd. Mid term and Endline Evaluation: A mid-term evaluation will be done by the \nsecond year end for reviewing progress and learning based on which \nrecommendations will be incorporated. Mid term assessment typically \ninvolves assessment of the progress, more importantly capturing the key \nlearnings and assessment of any mid-term course correction requirement in \nthe project. It is carried out by Traidcraft team members who are not \ndirectly associated with the project management or implementation. A final \nevaluation will be conducted by the project end using mixed methodology \n(both qualitative and quantitative tools with participatory approaches) to \nassess the project\u2019s impact and learning including progress against all \nindicators, outcomes and objectives. It is especially important as proposed \nwork is a multi-phase programme, where the learnings from the endline \nevaluation will contribute to the design of the next phase.", "11. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS/ Future Plans": "11. Future Plans\nHow will the grant influence the organisation and future plans? (maximum \nGrant Application Form, July 1 201326\n300 words):\nTraidcraft is keen to work to resolve issues of tea workers and so this is a long \nterm partnership. Along with our local partners we will support interventions to \nimprove the livelihoods of the tea worker communities and help in developing \nsustainable models for income diversification while imparting new skills and \nknowledge. Based on this, there is significant scope of expanding these initiatives \nin similar geographies with similar issues. The grant will also demonstrate \nmultipronged intervention models based on an assessment of skills, resources, \ncapabilities and aspirations of the community of tea workers.\n \nWhile Traidcraft has already gained an understanding of multidimensional \nvulnerability in the lives of tea worker communities, the interventions require a \nlong-term engagement with the community. Having suffered from such issues \nacross generations, there is a sense of hopelessness and erosion of agency. \nTherefore, it is imperative that interventions build incremental improvement and \nthereby confidence to exert their agency. Thus the intervention design will span \nmulti-phase interventions, of which the current phase is primarily the entry point, \naimed at establishing rapport and confidence as well as an enabling environment \nto piggy back other interventions addressing issues of rights, working conditions, \nmigration, trafficking, violence and climate change. In this, there is opportunity to \nscale operations in other geographies in the north east as well as other tea \ngrowing regions.\n \nTraidcraft UK, through its previous interventions with global brands, has \nsignificant experience of creating transparency in sourcing tea and also raising \nconsumer awareness regarding issues on the ground. A long-term model for \ndomestic area can be designed to raise consumer awareness regarding the issues \nfaced by workers and engaging local brands and other stakeholders in promoting \nmore transparent ways of operating. This will create a new wave in consumer \nawareness and brand engagement in the country which has one of the highest tea \nconsuming population.\n \nTraidcraft also will take a lead role to create a multi-stakeholder platform for the \nissues in the tea sector. This platform will have civil society organisations, donor \nagencies, local activists and government representatives who will work towards \nimproving policy and action taking into account the voices of the affected people. \nWe envisage that such a platform will provide Traidcraft the opportunity to \nhighlight the issues of the tea worker community and create an enabling \nenvironment overall.\n \nGiven that climate change has a significant impact on productivity in the tea sector \nTraidcraft, through this project will rope in other stakeholders like the Tea \nResearch Association etc. to provide the needed inputs and knowledge on better \nmanagement practices suitable to changing climatic conditions which will provide \nuseful directions to other tea estate managements in the regions.\n \nTraidcraft will actively disseminate these learnings amongst a wide audience so \nthat there is greater awareness on the issues of tea.  This will enable a more \nequitable playing field for various actors engaged in the tea industry, especially \nthe tea estate workers who constitute the weakest link in the chain.\nGrant Application Form, July 1 201327", "12.

(600 \nwords): \nContext \nInformal workers form the mainstay of the Indian economy. Informal workers in Kolkata\u2019s slum \nsettlements face numerous challenges. Economically, they endure unstable incomes, lack social \nsecurity, and are often exploited. Housing is overcrowded and poorly constructed. Health issues \nare rampant due to unsanitary conditions, limited healthcare access, and poor nutrition. \nEducational opportunities are scarce, with many children forced into labor. Environmental \nhazards, such as pollution and vulnerability to natural disasters, exacerbate their living \nconditions. Basic infrastructure, including clean water, electricity, and proper sewage systems, is \noften inadequate.  \nThe Kolkata Metropolitan Area is a metropolitan area in the Indian state of West Bengal, centred \naround the city of Kolkata (also known as Calcutta). It is the largest urban agglomeration in the \neastern part of India and the third largest in the country, housing over 14.85 million people, as of \nthe 2011 census. The Kolkata Metropolitan Area is comprised of the city of Kolkata, its suburbs, \nseveral neighbouring towns (including 4 municipal corporations, and 27 municipalities) and \nadjoining rural areas. It is the economic, cultural, and educational hub of eastern India and hosts \nseveral major commercial and industrial centres, making it one of the most important economic \nzones in India.[3] \nInformal workers like street vendors, domestic workers, construction workers and waste pickers \nare expected to be around 20 - 25 lakh (over 2 million) in a similar situation as other parts of the \ncountry, without much social security and living in the margins of the current developmental \ndiscourse. The KMA also has a large informal sector that employs a significant number of migrant \nworkers, particularly in construction, domestic work, and small-scale industries. These workers \nface compounded challenges such as low wages, long working hours, and poor working \nconditions. Many of them live in makeshift housing and lack access to basic amenities like clean \nwater, sanitation, and health care. Migrant workers face social challenges, such as \ndiscrimination, isolation, and limited access to education and health services. It is estimated that \naround 50% of the informal workers (1 million) are migrants, with an equal percentage from \nother districts of Bengal and migrants from other states like Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, and \nAssam. An equal or similar share of outmigration is reported as well.[4] \nThe Kolkata Metropolitan Area is also located precariously. Like many other coastal cities in the \nworld, is facing a range of impacts from climate change and is listed in the top eight megacities \nto be first impacted by climate change. The city is in the deltaic region of eastern India, which \nmakes it vulnerable to sea level rise and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather \nevents such as tropical cyclones, heavy rainfall, and heat waves.[5] The changing climate is \nleading to an increased risk of coastal flooding and erosion, as well as water scarcity, particularly \nduring the dry season. The city's infrastructure and public services, including transportation, \nenergy, and water systems, are also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which can \nstrain these systems and result in economic losses. In addition to the physical impacts, the \nchanging climate also has social and economic impacts on the people of the Kolkata \nMetropolitan Area. The most impacted areas overlapping directly with the informal worker \nsettlements in the region are vulnerable to displacement, loss of livelihoods, and increased \npoverty because of climate change. \n \n \nOak Application Form     7 \nTo address these challenges, the government in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area, led by the \nKolkata Municipal Corporation are taking steps to increase the region's resilience to climate \nchange. This includes implementing flood control measures, improving disaster preparedness \nand response, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, and preparing climate action plans for \ntheir cities.[6][7] The major concern in the slew of positively directed actions is that informal \nworkers, their live-work settlements and their livelihoods as of now are not a major focus area \nof the climate resilience actions pushed by the state and authorities. Thereby ignoring the most \nvulnerable, impacted informal workers from the climate resilience action plans for the region. \nAlso straight-jacketed approaches of focusing on the urban \u2018infrastructure\u2019 building, without \nfocusing on capacities and linkages ignoring migration from climate-impacted rural regions is \nanother gap amongst many in the climate resilience actions. This approach requires a \u2018change\u2019: \nin perspective and in action.  That is what this intervention sets to achieve \u2013 CHANGE that is for \nand led by the empowerment of the most vulnerable informal worker communities. \n[1] In India, informal workers are those individuals who work in unorganized sectors and are not \ncovered by labour laws or social security measures. This segment of the workforce includes self-\nemployed individuals, casual labourers, street vendors, domestic workers, and other \nunorganized sector workers. \n[2] The labour codes in India refer to a set of laws and regulations that govern various aspects of \nemployment, including wages, working conditions, social security, and industrial relations. In \n2020, the Indian government introduced four new labour codes, namely, the Code on Wages, \nthe Industrial Relations Code, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, and \nthe Social Security Code. \n[3] https://kmda.wb.gov.in/ \n[4] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/more-migrants-to-city-from-other-states-\nthan-districts/articleshow/70354414.cms \n[5] https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/disaster-deaths-sinking-unprepared-\nkolkata-face-multiple-climate-risks-warns-ipcc-report-82004 \n[6] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-set-to-get-own-climate-action-plan-\n2nd-city-after-mum/articleshow/92049423.cms \n[7] https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/cop27-kolkata-presents-climate-action-\nroadmap-announces-city-level-summit-86026 \nMHT with support from the Oak Foundation will implement the project titled \u201cCommunity Led \nclimate resilience for informal workers\u201d with an objective to build resilience of urban poor \nfamilies.

Community Mobilization: In the challenging and often marginalized \nenvironments of urban settlement in both ULB, community mobilization plays \na pivotal role in initiating and sustaining positive change. MHT will deploy \ndiverse methods such as folk media, community meetings and video \nscreenings to engage residents based on their local context and acceptance. \nThe overarching goal is to raise awareness about the organization and project \ndetails while establishing a strong rapport with the community. This approach \nensures active community participation and a sense of ownership over the \nprojects.  \n \nii. Research study  \nBaseline study on social security: In the inception stage of the project (1st quarter) \nhousehold level social security survey will be carried out in 30 project slums. Survey \nwill be conducted with below given objectives: \nAssess Accessibility and Awareness: \n\u2022 Objective: To evaluate the current level of accessibility to and awareness of \nexisting social security schemes among households in the project slums. \n \n \nOak Application Form     10 \n\u2022 Rationale: Understanding the baseline accessibility and awareness will help \nidentify gaps and barriers preventing households from fully benefiting from \nthese schemes. \nIdentify Needs and Preferences: \n\u2022 Objective: To identify the specific social security needs of households and \ntheir preferred methods for receiving services. \n\u2022 Rationale: Gathering information on households' needs and preferences will \nenable the project to tailor interventions and recommendations to better \nmeet the community's requirements. \nEvaluate Willingness to Pay: \n\u2022 Objective: To determine the willingness of households to pay for social \nsecurity services and their expectations regarding service delivery. \n\u2022 Rationale: Understanding the financial willingness and expectations of \nhouseholds will inform the design and implementation of sustainable social \nprotection schemes that are both affordable and acceptable to the \ncommunity. \niii. Landscape study- integration of climate resilience in existing policy: To \nenhance climate resilience for the urban poor and informal sector workers, we \npropose conducting a comprehensive landscape study of existing state and \nlocal government policies and programs. This intervention will involve a \ndetailed analysis of current policy frameworks to assess the extent to which \nclimate change considerations are integrated. By identifying gaps and \nopportunities, we aim to pinpoint strategic entry points for strengthening \nclimate resilience measures within social security programs. This approach will \nenable us to develop targeted recommendations for policy enhancements \nthat not only address immediate social security needs but also build long-term \nresilience against climate-related vulnerabilities, ensuring sustainable and \ninclusive growth for the most marginalized populations. \niv.  Formation and Trainings of CAGs : It is increasingly accepted that the social \ncapital of communities can contribute to beneficial economic and social \noutcomes in urban development. MHT believes that if the grassroots \ncollectives of women are provided with the requisite knowledge, technology \nand skills to identify and assess development issues, they will be able to \nconstructively engage with governance and planning processes to lead \ntransformation in their own communities. Based on this philosophy, MHT will \norganise and train women leaders from urban poor communities across city. \nThese women leaders will undergo extensive training on various subject like \ncollective leadership, government structure, map sharing & participation, \nformation of slum development plan, climate change etc. These women \nleaders will then lead project activities in urban poor settlements across both \nULB. They will play pivotal role in connecting urban poor communities with \ncity government, elected representative and other stakeholders.

Conduct Climate Vulnerability Assessment  \nCommunity-based Vulnerability Assessment is being done with special toolkit which \nis a set of seven participatory tools, which aimed to create an understanding among \nthe community about climate change and its varied impacts. The purpose of this \nexercise is to create a understanding in terms of climate change. The first stage of the \nexercise is the realise stage, where the purpose is to inculcate a understanding where \nthe community starts to envision the harmful weather effects that they are facing \nwith climate change. The second stage is the Analyse stage, where community starts \nto interlink the effects and initiate a thought process from systems thinking approach. \nThe third stage contains visualization of effects with respect to their areas. In the last \nstage, based upon the previous processes where risks were identified, community will \nsynthesis a resilience plan. \n \nvii. Develop Climate Resilience Action Plan : Based on the vulnerability \nassessment, the leaders will be trained to make action plan. CAGs along with \nother active members from settlement will prioritize activities, timeline, \nbudget to accomplish the activities.   \n \nviii. Implementation of Climate Resilience Action Plan  Based on the settlement \nclimate resilience plan, Community Action Groups (CAGs) and other active \nsettlement members will take the lead in implementing the plan. MHT will play \na pivotal role by demonstrating key activities in selected settlements to inspire \nand encourage leaders to mobilize resources effectively. This hands-on \napproach will provide a practical framework, showcasing successful strategies \nand fostering confidence among leaders to prioritize activities, establish \nrealistic timelines, and allocate necessary budgets. Through this collaborative \neffort, the community will be better equipped to enhance its resilience against \nclimate-related challenges, ensuring a more sustainable and secure future. \n \n \nOak Application Form     13 \n \nix. Provide technical assistance to social enterprise to make livelihood climate \nresilience  \nProviding technical assistance to social enterprises of urban informal workers \nto enhance climate resilience involves several steps. Trainings awareness will \nbe offered on climate-smart practices, such as sustainable waste \nmanagement, energy-efficient technologies, and climate-resilient livelihood, \naccessing marketing support, finance etc. Collaborate with local government \nand service providers to create support networks. Networking support will \nempower informal workers to sustain their livelihoods amidst climate \nchallenges. \n \nx. Demonstration of climate resilience Solution : Based on priority, need, and \nvulnerability assessments, climate resilience solutions for various climate \nstresses, including heat and flooding, will be planned. MHT's extensive \nexperience in heat and flooding resilience technologies will be leveraged, \nincorporating solutions such as solar reflective white paints, net zero cooling \nstations, and vector-borne disease control drives. These interventions will be \nstrategically implemented to address specific vulnerabilities, ensuring the \ncommunity is better equipped to withstand and adapt to climate challenges. \nMHT's expertise will guide the community in adopting effective, sustainable \npractices to enhance overall resilience and improve living conditions. \nFollowing table shows timeline of each activities  \n \nSr.No Activities Unit Total \nUnit  \nYear \n1 \nYear \n2 \nYear \n3 \nYear \n4 \nObjective \n1: \n Formation and \nempowerment of \nwomen led Community \nAction Groups (CAGs) to \nsupport informal sector \nworkers and urban poor \npopulation.  \n            \n1.1 \n30 resilient and self-reliant \nwomen led Community \nAction Groups from \ninformal workers\u2019 \nsettlements/ sites are \naware of worker rights, \naccess to entitlements, \nsocial protection, climate \nissues and adaptation.  \n            \nA video screening Settlemen\nt/ site 60 24 30 6 0 \nB sensitization Settlemen\nt/ site 60 24 30 6 0 \nC street play/folk media Settlemen\nt/ site 30 12 15 3 0 \n \n \nOak Application Form     14 \nD IEC material development  \nand printing Lump sum 4 1 1 1 1 \n1.2 \nThe efforts of the \nempowered and \ncapacitated 600 women \nleaders will play pivotal \nrole in enrolment and avail \nof social security schemes.  \n            \nA TOT- Project staff Training 1 1 0 0 0 \nB \nModule \ncreation/translation/updat\ning \nmodule 6 6 0 0 0 \nC \nTraining of CBO/CAG  \n(four module including \nCAG/ CBO formation, basic \nclimate change, Climate \nstress, ULB & Social \nsecurity scheme)  \nTraining 120 48 60 12 0 \n                \n1.3 \nTwo ULB level Vikasini \nFederation are formed and \nactively engaged in city, \nward level coordination, \nnetworking efforts to \nmainstream issues of \ninformal workers.

(300 words): \n \nFounded in 2004, Kolkata Sanved (KS) is a women -led pioneer organization in the field \nof Dance Movement Therapy (DMT), promoting holistic well -being and quality life \nenhancement. KS has contributed to gender equality, mental health and well -being by \nworking for empowerment of marginalized individuals (children, adolescent girls, youth \n& women) using DMT and other creative arts. \n \nIn the 1990\u2019s, Sohini Chakraborty began experimenting  with DMT to complement the \ntraditional rehabilitation process with the residents of an NGO -run shelter home in \nKolkata. The initiative grew into a full -blown project and finally culminated in the \nestablishment of Kolkata Sanved in 2004 to serve as a platf orm for using DMT in \npsychosocial rehabilitation.  Sohini was awarded the Ashoka Fellowship for her \n \n \nOak Application Form8 \ninnovative and unique idea that incorporated creative therapies within traditional \nrehabilitation programmes, and more importantly: in building capacity with in the \nparticipants to become DMT practitioners themselves, able to earn a living as well as live \na life of dignity and respect.   \n \nKS\u2019s culturally contextual model Sampoornata (meaning \u201cfulfilment\u201d) focuses on holistic \nwell-being and bringing about a \u201ccha nge within\u201d. This includes physical, emotional, \nmental, spiritual and social aspects. The model focuses on psycho -social rehabilitation \nof survivors of violence & marginalization, prevention of violence & promotion of mental \nhealth. The hallmark of Sampoornata is to create DMT practitioners, leaders and change-\nmakers from grassroots. 60% of KS core employees are from marginalized communities \nwith representations in primary constituents, Board & Senior Leadership Team.  \n \nKS has broken new grounds by taking i ts work to various non -profits, marginalized \ncommunities, mainstream schools, NGO &Govt.  run care institutions, mental hospitals \netc.by collaborating with 60+ organizations and government departments across South \nAsia. Working with diverse population, KS has expanded its reach to seven states.The \nestablishment of the Dance Movement Therapy Leadership Development Academy \n(DMTLDA) signifies a structured approach to facilitate the growth of DMT practitioners \nfrom underprivileged communities. 130+ such individ uals have developed skills to \nbecome DMT practitioners & change -makers with recognition of 10+ such DMT \npractitioners at the national and international level. Along with this, KS, in partnership \nwith the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, offers a Post Graduate Diploma \nprogram in DMT. This significant milestone places DMT within the realm of academic \nrigor and formal recognition, contributing to the creation of a new discipline and \nprofession with 200+graduates.Over the years, KS has established a strong collaboration \nwith the Department of Women and Child Development and Social Welfare, Government \nof West Bengal &Maharashtra. Kolkata Sanved was featured in an international \ndocumentary film called \"Little Stones,\" with over 70 screenings globally. KS's work was \nshowcased on the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN). The Kolkata Sanved Sampoornata \nmodel was published as a book by Routledge - Taylor and Francis Group. To date, \nKolkata Sanved has served 65,000+ members of marginalized communities and \nconnected with 200,000+ citizens.   \n \nKS\u2019s V ision is to form a healthy, violence -free, gender -equal, creative society of \nempowered individuals.  \n \nOur Mission is to enhance gender equality and improve mental health and wellbeing of \nindividuals and communities by building an ecosystem for DMT for social development. \nWe strive to create DMT practitioners, leaders and change -makers in the field from \nvulnerable & un derprivileged communities by establishing a Centre for Creative \nWellbeing and Social Change. \n \n \n5f.

(600 words): \n \nIndia is home to the world's largest youth population, totalling over 808 million individuals, \nconstituting around 66% of the overall populace. The mental health and well -being of \nadolescents and young adults are pivotal for comprehensive development. Give n that a \nsignificant portion of mental health conditions emerges by the mid -twenties, a systematic \napproach to addressing youth mental health is imperative. India, with a youth demographic \nof over 250 million aged 15 \u201324, grapples with unique challenges suc h as academic \npressure, interpersonal relationships, vocational concerns, and discrimination based on \ncaste, social status, and gender norms. The National Mental Health Survey for India \ndiscloses alarmingly high suicide rates, standing at 17.1 per 100,000 among young adults \nand 9.52 per 100,000 among adolescents. The COVID -19 pandemic exacerbated existing \nchallenges, leading to increased stress, depression, anxiety, post -traumatic stress, \nsubstance abuse, and suicides among young people. The pandemic widene d existing \ninequities, disproportionately affecting those in poor communities, who face additional \nbarriers in accessing resources for health, education and social welfare.  \nDespite being viewed as the energetic force shaping society's future, the youth ar e \nsusceptible to various challenges and vulnerabilities. These encompass engaging in high -\nrisk behaviours exposing them to criminal activities, accidents, physical injuries, emotional \ndistress, and various health issues. Limited employment options, restric ted access to \ninformation, and economic displacement have a lasting psycho-social impact on children, \nyouth, and their families, particularly concerning mental health. This impact manifests in \nfeelings of isolation, identity struggles, and a prevailing sense of hopelessness. \nThe youth in North Bengal's tea gardens face multifaceted challenges that hinder their \ngrowth, development, and wellbeing. These challenges stem from the historical context of \nthe tea industry's crisis, economic disparities, and lack of  access to education and \nopportunities. Although tea estate employees constitute a substantial workforce, their \nsocio-economic conditions remain deplorable. \nWithin this context, the youth in tea gardens confront an array of challenges, including \nseverely limited access to quality education, healthcare, and employment opportunities, \nfostering a pervasive sense of hopelessness and disempowerment. Many youths and \nteenagers in these areas struggle for survival, with educational opportunities remaining \ndistant dreams for most. Children and youth often fall victim to trafficking for labour and \nother forms of exploitation, exacerbating their challenges. \nSustained psycho -social support interventions are essential to empower the youth, \nenhance their mental and emotio nal resilience, and provide them with opportunities for a \nbrighter future.  \nOur approach involves engaging youth groups and key stakeholders through Dance \nMovement Therapy (DMT) sessions, ensuring a participatory process that incorporates \ntheir voices and perspectives into the design of future interventions. \nIn accordance with the Kolkata Sanved model, the process for establishing the demand for \nmental well-being interventions follows a strategic sequence. Initially, our model operates \nin collaboration with  existing organizations in the region and the target community, \nleveraging established networks and resources. Secondly, a community network is \ncultivated, providing orientation to individuals on the benefits of mental well-being to raise \nawareness and pro mote understanding within the community. The intervention itself \n \n \nOak Application Form10 \nincorporates a unique feature, offering participants the opportunity to undergo training as \nDance Movement Therapy (DMT) practitioners and change-makers. This approach not only \nenhances the s kills and knowledge of community members but also empowers them to \nactively contribute to mental well -being initiatives. A pivotal role is played by the youth \nleader who, having undergone training becomes an ambassador through this process, and \nconducts well-being sessions within the community. This individual effectively bridges the \ngap, meeting the demand for mental well-being interventions at the grassroots level. \n \n \n6.

Activities and timeframe: \nList in bullet points the main types of activities that you plan to carry out to achieve your \nexpected outcomes. Please keep these at a high level and don\u2019t include the full list of every \nactivity you plan to carry out, Instead, concentrate on the type of activities this grant will fund. \nIf your Programme Officer wants more information, we will ask you separately for a work plan. \nExamples might include: \no Research  \no Provision of legal advice to... \no Trainings on movement building for... \n \nPhase 1: Formative Research and piloting DMT session: 18 months  \n \nIn the first half of the project, our primary focus will be on conducting a thorough Needs \nAssessment and Situational Analysis. This step is pivotal for understanding the unique \nchallenges and aspirations of the local youth, communities, and stakeholders within North \nBengal in relation to mental health and well -being. This phase will involve multiple crucial \nactivities including a pilot of DMT sessions within the new region. To start off with, Kolkata \nSanved will conduct an orientation on the program with all the concerned stakeholders. \n \nThe broad activities will include: \n \n\u25cf Preparation: Project team formation, partner identification, stakeholder mapping, \nlocation identification \n\u25cf Situational analysis and assessment: Research design and methodology, data \ncollection, DMT sessions with the youth, data analysis \n\u25cf Community engagement  through DMT, DMT based workshops with youth and \nstakeholders \n\u25cf Developing Final Module and Intervention Plan: Dissemination with local \nstakeholders \n\u25cf Monitoring & Documentation \nIn this participatory research methodology, the tools that will be used for data c ollection \nare a combination of the following, which includes survey, Focused Group Discussions \n(FGD), one to one interview, self -reporting through questionnaires and Dance Movement \ntherapy-based workshops. Kolkata Sanved plans to engage Praxis for implemen ting this \nresearch.  \nThis situation analysis will be a community led research where the youth and community \nmembers will be involved in the research process. For example, having a discussion with \nthem to develop research questions in order to design the intervention around their needs.  \nThe formative research will largely focus on the current reality of North Bengal Youth \nwhether the planned intervention will fulfil the needs and complement those reality. The \nresearch will include sample locations with a mi x of socio -cultural identities, including \ngender and a few other categories such as education, opportunity, aspirations. Ideally, we \nare planning for 3 locations in each district to get a comprehensive scenario. As this \n \n \nOak Application Form12 \nintervention will be focused on ment al health, wellbeing and agency building, we will also \ninclude a mental health expert in the team.  \nPhase 2: Implementation: 18 months \nIn the second half of the project, our focus will be to implement the intervention plan in at \nleast one block in Jalpaiguri and Kalimpong division, targeting approximately 100 youth \nthrough DMT-based regular training and workshops. Our goal is to create at least 20 \nyouth leaders, engage 10 key influencers, and involve 200 community members. \n\u25cf Training Of Trainer with youth. \n\u25cf DMT based Healing Wellbeing sessions \n\u25cf DMT based capacity building sessions \n\u25cf Baseline and Endline data collection \n\u25cf Community Engagement \n\u25cf Collaborative Network Formation  \n\u25cf Monitoring & Documentation \n \n7. CAPACITY BUILDING \n \nWill this grant contain funds specifically ear-marked for Capacity Building / Organizational \nDevelopment (CB/OD) of your organization, or does the grant have a specific CB/OD \ncomponent? \n \nYES  \n \nKolkata Sanved is in the process of creating its Centre for Cre ative Wellbeing and Social \nChange, where we have received our first funding support to lay down the infrastructure. \nThis centre will gradually transform into an institute. With the establishment of the institute, \nKolkata Sanved has a tremendous opportunity  to leverage its partnerships and revenue -\ngenerating activities. Our goal is to create Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) entrepreneurs \nfrom this institute. The institute will serve as a hub for training programs, workshops, and \nacademic courses, attracting both students and professionals from various regions.  \n \nKolkata Sanved is unique in its commitment towards staff well -being and skill building, \nleading to organizational enhancement. We firmly believe that capacity building of staff \ncontributes to the strength  of the organization which aids in its growth and impact in the \nsector. We believe in and practice honoring lived experience. The power of lived \nexperiences is encapsulated in our model and reflected in our programme and journey. \n60% of our employees have emerged from grass root backgrounds, a testament to our \ninclusive ethos. Their presence extends not only within the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) \nbut also our governing body.  \n \nPresently, we are actively engaged in strengthening our second -line leaders (SLT), aiming \nto develop a Collective Leadership Model within the organization. To develop this model, \nKolkata Sanved intends to invest on a process -based approach on its SLT over a span of \n3 years. This model ensures that leadership is distributed across the organization, tapping \n \n \nOak Application Form13 \ninto diverse perspectives and expertise. Additionally, this model empowers employees at \nall levels, creating a sense of ownership and commitment to the organization's mission.  \n \nThe trainings under this model will include personal growth sessions, group development \nworkshops, strategic planning workshops, and mentorship sessions. By prioritizing these \naspects, KS fosters a culture of reflective leadership, where leaders are encouraged to \ncontinuously learn and grow. This not only benefits the individual employees but also \ncreates a work environment where everyone feels supported, valued, and empowered to \ncontribute effectively. \n \nThe activities will include: \n \n1. Personal Growth sessions: Personal growth sessions give employees opportunity \nto nurture self -awareness, resilience, and emotional intelligence which are \nessential qualities for effective leadership. Improved mental health leads to higher \nproductivity and better decision-making skill. This activity will comprise of a total \nof 20 group personal growth sessions for 5 groups @ 4 sessions per group per \nyear for 3 years. \n \n2. Group Development workshops: These workshops will emphasize on team \nbuilding and strengthening efforts with specific focus on nurturing communication \nskills, feedback skills, appreciative inquiry and creating a sense of ownership. It \nalso helps in creating a supportive work place environment. This will comprise of \n4 days of workshops per year, for 3 years with the entire KS team. \n \n3. Strategic Planning workshops: These workshops will help to create the framework \nand develop key principles of Collective Leadership Model. It will comprise of 4 \ndays of workshop with the SLT in year 1 and 2 days of review workshop in year 2. \n \n4. Mentorship sessions: These sessions are required for mentoring SLT members on \na regular basis on issue -based understanding of the working field as some \nmembers come from non-academic background and did not get the opportunity \nfor a ttending formal education. They have mostly acquired knowledge on the \nsector through lived experiences. This will include 2 days of session and 1 day \nassessment (total 3 days), every 6 months for 3 years. \n \nData Management and New Technologies: This part we want technical support from OAK \n \nThe adoption of emerging technologies enables capacity building by fostering \ninnovation and providing tools for skill development.

(300 words)  \n \nWe've strengthened our collaborative efforts by introducing specific parameters for \ncollaboration. Before entering into any partnership, we initiate scoping visits and conduct \ncomprehensive orientations for our partners on Dance Movement Therapy (DMT).  These \norientations encompass both theoretical and experiential aspects to ensure a profound \nunderstanding of  the process. Moreover, we engage participants in these orientations, \nvaluing their feedback and insights, which are then incorporated into the design and \nimplementation plans, including DMT session plans. \n \nThe entire project will involve multiple stakehol ders, including community youth, \ngovernment organizations (GOs), non -governmental organizations (NGOs), civil society, \nand community members. Key stakeholders include the Department of Women and Child \nDevelopment, the District Magistrate's (D.M.) Office, the District Child Protection Unit, the \n \n \nOak Application Form15 \nDistrict Social Welfare Office (DSWO), the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child \nRights (WBCPCR), local schools, North Bengal University, and NGOs operating in North \nBengal, such as Rural Aid, Pratham, and Jalpaiguri Mahila Kalyan Samiti.", "9.

How will you know if you are achieving your objectives? Please \ndescribe briefly how you will know if you are making progress and if what you are doing is \nworking. If you have a formal monitoring and evaluation system and if you plan to collect \nindicator data or conduct an external evaluation, please provide details here.    \nb) Learning. Please tell us if there anything in particular that you are hoping to learn more \nabout or test through this grant. (300 words) \n \nThroughout the project period, a comprehensive assessment will be conducted to evaluate \nthe project's achievements and shortcomings. This reflective process aims to extract \nvaluable insights that can frame future initiatives and strategies to scale up this model in \nthe N orth Bengal region. Lessons learned will be carefully documented, highlighting \nsuccessful methodologies and areas for improvement. Stakeholder feedback and project \noutcomes will be analyzed to enhance understanding and contribute to the organization's \ncontinuous growth. \n \n- At least 2 monitoring meetings will take place during phase 1. Monitoring meetings \nwill take place with the team members at every quarter. \n- At least 3 monitoring visits will take place during phase 2 of implementation. These \nvisits will be c onducted at the block level, which serves as the unit of \nimplementation. \nThe above-mentioned monitoring meetings and visits at the site will help to assess the \nteam\u2019s progress on the work done and mitigate challenges in the course of its work. This \nwill also help the organization to assess whether the course of work is proving to be \neffective for the service receivers or requires modifications.  \n- As part of the intervention plan developed after formative research, KS will establish \nspecific indicators for the project. These indicators will guide the mapping of the \nintervention's progress, with data collected at baseline and end line. Formats will be \ncreated to facilitate data collection by DMT practitioners and social workers. These \nformats will primarily focus on three key areas: \n\u2714 A checklist of indicators mapping project progress  \n\u2714 A checklist of indicators mapping the formation of the collaborative network \n\u2714 A checklist of indicators mapping healing, wellbeing and psycho -social and \nleadership skills within the adolescent girls and youth. \nLearning: Through the first phase of this program consisting of formative research, we will \nformulate an understanding of th e mental health and wellbeing needs of a new \n \n \nOak Application Form16 \ndemographic group \u2013 youth of North Bengal.  We will be testing an implementation plan \nbased on the research and participation of youth and key stakeholders.  \nKolkata Sanved has its own customized internal assess ment/evaluation set -up for \nsupervising and understanding the impact of Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) sessions \non it\u2019s participants. This process starts at the very beginning, with the commencement of \nany new programs/projects. Our current assessment strategies also include daily session \nreports by Dance Movement Therapy Practitioners, Self-reporting by participants through \nfeedback and reflections, base -line, midline and end line survey, case study interview, \nmonthly output tracking, attendance keeping, eval uation and review, learning and \nreflection meetings with DMT practitioners.  \n \nThe Assessment /Evaluation Process comprises of methodical collection of data on a \nproject basis and a quarterly/yearly basis, to assess what has happened in order to \nimprove future work, and provide links between past, present, and future work. In order \nto assure a lack of bias, third party external evaluators are hired to assess our DMT impact \nas well. Final assessment reports are always available for participants, stake holders , to \nthe collaborative organizations, donors, students or anyone who wants to read.", "10. RISKS AND CHALLENGES": "10.
